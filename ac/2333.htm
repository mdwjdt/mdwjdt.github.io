<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2333节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2333.</strong>“清早起来再赶路”表以这种方式得以巩固在良善与真理中。这从“清早起来”和“再赶路”的含义清楚可知。在圣言中，“清早（早晨）”表主的国度和凡属主国度之物，因而主要表从爱与仁所流出的良善，这人可从圣言（19:5）得以证实；而“路”表真理（参看<a href="627.htm">627</a>节）。由此可知，他们在他家里过夜后（这表示他们居于他所拥有的仁之善中），“清早起来就赶路”，这表示他们以这种方式得以巩固在良善与真理中。<br />由此，如由其它经文那样明显可知，内义，尤其圣言历史部分的内义，距离字义何等遥远，因而如何隐藏而不可见；并且除非每句话的含义照其在圣言中的一贯含义被解读出来，否则，这内义不会显现出来。因此，若思想拘守于字义，内义只会显为完全模糊、黑暗之物。而另一方面，若思想被保守在内义中，字义同样显得模糊，在天使看来甚至如同没有。因为天使不再象世人那样具有世俗和肉体的观念，而是具有属灵和属天的观念。当世人所阅读的圣言上升至天使所在的气场，即天堂时，字义上的这些话就会奇迹般被转换为属灵和属天的观念。这是因为属灵之物和世俗之物、属天之物和肉体之物存在对应关系。这种对应关系是最为恒定不变的，但其性质要等到圣言中的这些话、名字和数字的内义被解读出来时才能被揭示出来。<br />为了解这种对应关系的性质，或也可说，当世俗和肉体的观念被提升至天堂时，它们如何逐渐变成相对应的属灵和属天的观念，以“清早（或早晨）”和“路”为例。当人读到“早晨”，如此处“清早起来”这句话时，天使没有一天早晨这样的概念，而是有属灵之义上的早晨的概念。这种概念如同撒母耳记中所描述的：<br />以色列的磐石，祂必像日出的晨光，如无云的清晨。（撒母耳记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下23.3.htm">23:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下23.4.htm">4</a>）<br />但以理书：<br />圣者对我说，到二千三百个晚上和早晨。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但8.14.htm">8:14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/但8.26.htm">26</a>）<br />天使觉察到的是主，或祂的国度，或爱与仁的属天之物，而不是“早晨”。事实上，这些事物照世人所读的一系列内容而各式各样。<br />同样，读到“路”，如此处“继续赶路”时，他们也没有路的概念，而是有另外属灵或属天的概念，即如同约翰福音书中那样的概念，在那里主说：<br />我就是道路、真理。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.6.htm">14:6</a>）<br />如诗篇：<br />耶和华啊，将你的道指示我，引我进入真理之路。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗25.4.htm">25:4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗25.5.htm">5</a>）<br />以赛亚书：<br />祂又将通达的道指教祂。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛40.14.htm">40:14</a>）<br />天使觉察到的是真理，而非“道”，无论圣言的历史部分还是预言部分，都是这样。天使不再对历史事件感兴趣，因为这些完全不符合他们的观念。故取而代之的是，他们觉察诸如属天主及其国度的那类事物，这些事物在内义上还以完美的次序和绝妙的序列相继出现。为此，也为了圣言能服务于天使，其中的所有历史细节都具有代表性，每句话都用来表示这类事物。这种特性使得圣言胜过其它所有着作。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2333</b></p><p><b>2333.</b>
And in the morning ye shall rise and go on your way. That this signifies confirmation in good and truth, may be seen from the signification of "rising in the morning," and also from the signification 
of "going on the way." In the Word "morning" signifies the Lord's kingdom and whatever belongs to the Lord's kingdom, thus principally the good of love and of charity, as will be confirmed from the Word 
at verse 15; and a "way" signifies truth (see n. 627); for which reason it is said that after they had been in his house and had passed the night there (by which is signified that they had an abode 
in the good of charity that was with him), they should "rise in the morning and go on their way," by which is signified being thereby thus confirmed in good and truth. [2] From this, as from other 
passages, it is evident how remote from the sense of the letter, and consequently how much unseen, is the internal sense, especially in the historical parts of the Word; and that it does not come to view 
unless the meaning of every word is unfolded in accordance with its constant signification in the Word. On this account, when the ideas are kept in the sense of the letter, the internal sense appears 
no otherwise than as something obscure and dark; but on the other hand when the ideas are kept in the internal sense, the sense of the letter appears in like manner obscure, nay, to the angels as 
nothing. For the angels are no longer in worldly and corporeal things, like those of man, but in spiritual and celestial things, into which the words of the sense of the letter are wonderfully changed, 
when it ascends from a man who is reading the Word to the sphere in which the angels are, that is, to heaven; and this from the correspondence of spiritual things with worldly, and of celestial things 
with corporeal. This correspondence is most constant, but its nature has not yet been disclosed until now in the unfolding of the meaning of the words, names, and numbers in the Word, as to the internal 
sense. [3] That it may be known what is the nature of this correspondence, or what is the same, how worldly and corporeal ideas pass into corresponding spiritual and celestial ideas when the former 
are elevated to heaven, take as an example "morning" and "way." When "morning" is read, as in the passage before us to "rise in the morning," the angels do not get an idea of any morning of a day, 
but an idea of morning in the spiritual sense, thus such a one as is described in Samuel: "The Rock of Israel He is as the light of the morning when the sun riseth, a morning without clouds" (2 Sam. 
23:3, 4); and in Daniel: "The holy one said unto me, Until evening, when morning comes, two thousand three hundred" (Dan. 8:14, 26). Thus instead of "morning" the angels perceive the Lord, or His Kingdom, 
or the heavenly things of love and charity; and these in fact with variety according to the series of things in the Word which is being read. [4] In like manner where "way" is read-as here, to 
"go on your way"-they can have no idea of a way, but another idea which is spiritual or celestial, namely, like that in John, where the Lord said: "I am the way and the truth" (John 14:6); and as in David: 
"Make Thy ways known to me, O Jehovah, lead my way in truth" (Ps. 25:4, 5); and in Isaiah: "He made Him to know the way of understanding" (Isa. 40:14). Thus instead of "way" the angels perceive 
truth, and this in both the historical and the prophetical parts of the Word. For the angels no longer care for the historical things, as these are altogether inadequate to their ideas; and therefore 
in place of them they perceive such things as belong to the Lord and His kingdom, and which also in the internal sense follow on in a beautiful order and well-connected series. For this reason, and also 
in order that the Word may be for the angels, all the historical things therein are representative, and each of the words is significative of such things; which peculiarity the Word has above all other writing. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2333</b></p><p><b>2333.</b>
'And in the morning you may rise up and go your way' means being strengthened in this way in good and truth. This becomes clear from the meaning of 'rising up in the morning', and also from the meaning 
of 'going on one's way'. In the Word 'the morning' means the Lord's kingdom and whatever belongs to the Lord's kingdom, and so primarily the good that flows from love and charity. This will be confirmed 
from the Word at verse 15. 'Way' however means truth, see <a href="627.htm">627</a>. From this it follows that after they had been in his house and spent the night there, which meant that they dwelt in the good of charity 
with him, 'they rose up in the morning and went their way', which means that in this way they were confirmed in good and truth. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 These phrases, as do all the rest, show how far removed the 
internal sense is from the sense of the letter and therefore how hidden from view it is, especially in the historical parts of the Word. They show that this sense is not discernible unless individual 
expressions are explained according to the meaning they have all through the Word. Consequently when ideas are confined to the sense of the letter, the internal sense is seen as something altogether 
dark and obscure. Conversely when ideas are confined to the internal sense, the sense of the letter in a similar way is seen as something obscure. Indeed angels see it as nothing, for angels no longer 
have worldly and bodily ideas as man does, but spiritual and celestial ones, into which the expressions of the sense of the letter are marvellously converted when the Word which man is reading rises 
up to the sphere in which angels dwell, that is, up to heaven. This happens because of the correspondence of spiritual things with worldly, and of celestial with bodily, a correspondence which is absolutely 
consistent but whose nature has not been disclosed until now in the explanation of expressions, names, and numbers in the Word as to their internal sense. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 So that the nature of that correspondence 
may be known, or what amounts to the same, how worldly and bodily ideas pass over into corresponding spiritual and celestial ideas when they are raised towards heaven, let 'the morning' and 
'way' be taken as examples: When a person reads of 'the morning', as in the phrase here 'rising up in the morning', angels do not conceive the idea of the start to a new day but the idea which 'morning' 
has in the spiritual sense. The idea they conceive is similar to the statement in Samuel, </p>
<blockquote>
The Rock of Israel . . . He is like morning light, when the sun rises on a cloudless morning. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=2%20Sam%2023:%203,%204&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">2 Sam 23: 3, 4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And in Daniel, </p>
<blockquote>
The Holy One said to me, Up to the evening when it is becoming morning, two thousand three hundred times. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Dan%208:%2014,%2026&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Dan 8: 14, 26</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Thus instead of 'the morning' angels perceive 
the Lord, or His kingdom, or celestial things of love and charity. This they do varyingly according to the train of thought in the Word which a person is reading. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 Similarly where a person reads 
of 'a way', as in 'going on your way' here, they cannot have any idea of a way, but a spiritual or a celestial idea, that is to say, like that in John, when the Lord said, </p>
<blockquote>
I am the way and the truth. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2014:%206&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 14: 6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Also the idea in David, </p>
<blockquote>
Make Your ways known to me, O Jehovah, guide my way in truth. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2025:%204,%205&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 25: 4, 5</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
He made him know the way of understanding. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2040:%2014&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 40: 14</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Thus 
instead of 'a way' angels perceive truth. They do so in the historical as well as the prophetical sections of the Word; in fact angels no longer have any interest in matters of history as these 
are not at all in keeping with the ideas they have. Consequently in place of historical details they perceive such things as belong to the Lord and His kingdom, which also follow on one after another 
in marvellous array and perfect sequence in the internal sense. For this reason, so that the Word may serve angels as well, all historical details there are representative, and each expression serves 
to mean such things. This special feature is what makes the Word different from all other literature. </p>

</p><b>2333.</b>
`Et mane surgatis, et eatis in viam vestram': quod significet sic confirmationem in bono et vero, constare potest a significatione `mane surgere,' tum a significatione `ire in viam.' `Mane' in Verbo 
significat regnum Domini, et quicquid est regni Domini, ita principaliter bonum amoris et charitatis, quod ex Verbo confirmabitur ad vers. 15: `via' autem significat verum, videatur n. 627; inde sequitur 
quod postquam fuerint: in domo ejus et ibi pernoctaverint, quo significatum quod mansionem in bono charitatis apud eum haberent, `mane surgerent et irent in viam suam,' quo significatur ita confirmatum 
esse in bono et vero.  [2] Ex his, sicut ex reliquis, patet quam remotus est sensus internus a sensu litterae, et inde quam inconspicuus, imprimis in historicis Verbi, et quod non pateat nisi singulae 
voces secundum constantem earum in Verbo significationem explicentur; quare cum in sensu litterae tenentur ideae, sensus internus non aliter apparet quam obscurum (c)et tenebrosum quid; at, vicissim 
cum in sensu interno tenentur ideae, apparet similiter sensus litterae obscurus, immo ab angelis sicut nihil, nam angeli non amplius sunt in {1} mundanis et corporeis quales sunt hominis, sed in 
{1} spiritualibus et caelestibus, in quas mirabiliter mutantur voces sensus litterae, cum ab homine qui legit Verbum, ad sphaeram in qua sunt angeli, hoc est, ad caelum ascendit, et hoc ex correspondentia 
spiritualium cum mundanis, et {2} caelestium cum corporeis, quae correspondentia constantissima est: sed qualis, nondum detectum, modo nunc in explicatione vocum, nominum et numerorum, quoad sensum 
internum, in Verbo; [3] ut sciatur qualis illa correspondentia est, seu quod idem, quomodo ideae mundanae et corporeae transeunt in correspondentes ideas spirituales et caelestes, cum illae elevantur 
ad caelum, sit pro exemplo `mane,' et `via': cum legitur mane, ut hic `mane surgere,' tunc angeli non ideam alicujus mane diei capiunt, sed ideam mane in sensu spirituali. ita similem ac apud Samuelem, 	Petra 
Israelis,... ille sicut lux mane cum oritur sol, mane non nubes, 2 Sam. xxiii (x)3, 4: </p>
<p>et apud Danielem, 	Sanctus dixit ad me, Usque ad vesperam, cum fit mane bis mille trecenta, (x)viii 
14, 16; </p>
<p>ita pro `mane' percipiunt Dominum, aut regnum Ipsius, aut caelestia amoris et charitatis, et quidem illa cum varietate secundum seriem rerum in Verbo quod legitur.  Similiter ubi legitur 
`via,' ut hic `ire in viam vestram,' non habere possunt aliquam ideam viae, sed spiritualem aut caelestem aliam, nempe similem ac apud Johannem, quod Dominus dixit, 	Ego sum via et veritas, xiv 6; </p>
<p>et 
quae apud Davidem, 	Viam tuas Jehovah notas fac mihi, duc viam meam in veritate, Ps. xxv 4, 5: </p>
<p>et apud `Esaiam, 	Viam intelligentiarum nosse fecit ipsi, xl 14; </p>
<p>ita pro `via' percipiunt verum, et 
hoc tam in historicis quam propheticis Verbi; historica enim non amplius curant angeli, quia ideis eorum prorsus non adaequata sunt, quare loco eorum talia quae sunt Domini et Ipsius regni percipiunt; 
quae etiam in pulchro ordine et concinna serie in sensu interno consequuntur; propterea, ut quoque pro angelis sit Verbum, omnia historica ibi sunt repraesentativa, et singula verba significativa talium, 
quod peculiare habet Verbum prae omni alio scripto. 	@1 i ideis.$ 	@2 tum.$ </p>
