<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10624节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10624</strong>.“以及三四代”表对虚假和由它们产生的邪恶的定罪。这从“儿子”的含义清楚可知，“儿子”是指邪恶的虚假，如刚才所述（<a href="10623.htm">10623</a>节）。经上之所以说“三四代”，是因为“三”与真理或虚假有关，“四”与良善或邪恶有关。在圣言中，一切数字都表示真实事物，一些数字属于属灵类别，一些数字则属于属天类别。数字三、六和十二属于属灵类别，数字二、四和八属于属天类别。属于属灵类别的数字与真理或虚假有关，而属于属天类别的数字则与良善或邪恶有关。“三”也表示整体上的一切真理，“四”表示整体上的一切良善。这一切解释了为何“三四代”表示虚假和由它们所产生的邪恶。但这些话的这层意义是天上的意义，因为它是由这些数字与这些虚假和邪恶的关系产生的。至于何为邪恶和由它们所产生的虚假，以及何为虚假和由它们所产生的邪恶，可参看10109节提到的地方。不过，还必须在此对它们作出一些说明。邪恶是一切虚假的源头，因为虚假就是那确认邪恶，或说证明邪恶是正当的，邪恶和虚假在一个人里面如意愿和理解力那样一致行动；事实上，一个人所愿意去做的，他也愿意去理解，因为他会通过理解力在自己面前在思维上，在他人面前在言语上形成自己的邪恶。由此明显可知何为邪恶和由它所产生的虚假，也就是邪恶的虚假。但当一个人在自己的心智中确认某种邪恶，或证明某种邪恶正当，然后得出结论，认为它不是邪恶，从而继续行恶时，虚假的邪恶就存在了。在这种情况下，他所行的邪恶来自虚假。例如，有人若为使自己满意，确认或证明通奸不是邪恶，由此继续犯下这种罪行，就会陷入虚假的虚假，因为他出于一种错误的假设而犯下这种罪行。虚假的邪恶主要存在于宗教信仰的问题上，因为包含在教义中的虚假会说服一个人确信某事是善的，而事实上，它是恶的；有时则说服他确信某事是恶的，而事实上，它是善的。</p>

Upon the thirds and upon the fourths. That this signifies the condemnation of falsities and of the derivative evils, is evident from the signification of "sons," as being the falsities of evil (of which 
just above, n. 10623). The reason why it is said "upon the thirds and upon the fourths," is that "three" is predicated of truths or falsities, and "four" is predicated of goods or evils. For in the 
Word all numbers signify things, some numbers belonging to the spiritual class, and some to the celestial class. The numbers three, six, and twelve belong to the spiritual class, and the numbers two, 
four, and eight to the celestial class. The numbers which belong to the spiritual class are predicated of truths or of falsities; and those which belong to the celestial class are predicated of goods 
or of evils. By "three" is also signified all truth in the complex; and by "four," all good in the complex. From this it is that by "sons the thirds and the fourths" are signified falsities and the 
derivative evils. But this sense of these words is the celestial sense, because it arises from the fact that they are predicated of these falsities and evils. (What evils and the derivative falsities 
are, and what falsities and the derivative evils are, may be seen at the places cited in n. 10109.) Here also something shall be said about evils and the derivative falsities, and about falsities and 
the derivative evils. Evils are the sources of all falsities, because falsities are what confirm evils, and evils and falsities act in a man as do the will and the understanding, for what a man wishes 
to do he also wishes to understand, because it is by means of the understanding that he forms his evil before himself in thought, and before others in speech. From this it is evident what evil and the 
derivative falsity are, that is, the falsity of evil. But the evil of falsity is when man has confirmed evil with himself, and has concluded that it is not evil, and consequently does it. In this case 
he does evil from falsity. For example, he who has confirmed with himself that adulteries are not evils, and from this does them, is in the evil of falsity, because he does them from a false principle. 
The evils of falsity are chiefly to be found in religious matters, for from the falsities of doctrine a man persuades himself that a thing is good, which nevertheless is evil; and sometimes that 
a thing is evil, which nevertheless is good. </p>

'On the third and on the fourth [generations]' means the condemnation of falsities and the evils arising from them. This is clear from the meaning of 'sons' as falsities of evil, dealt with immediately 
above in <a href="10623.htm">10623</a>. The reason why 'on the third and on the fourth [generations of them]' is added is that 'three' is associated with truths or falsities, and 'four' with forms of good or evils. In the 
Word all numbers serve to mean real things, some numbers belonging to the spiritual group, others to the celestial group. The numbers three, six, and twelve belong to the spiritual group, while two, 
four, and eight belong to the celestial. Numbers in the spiritual group are associated with truths or falsities, while those belonging to the celestial are associated with forms of good or evils. 'Three' 
also means all truth in its entirety, and 'four' all good in its entirety. All this explains why 'the third and fourth [generations]' means falsities and the evils arising from them. But this meaning 
of those words is their heavenly meaning because it arises out of the association of these numbers with those things. What evils and the falsities arising from them are, and what falsities and the 
evils from these are, may be seen in the places referred to in <a href="10109.htm">10109</a>. But something must also be stated about them here. Evils are the source from which all falsities arise, because falsities are what 
serve to justify evils and act in unison with them in a person as will and understanding do, in that what a person wills to do he also wills to understand. For by means of his understanding a person 
gives shape to his own evil, for himself in what he thinks and for others in what he utters. From this it is evident what evil and the falsity arising from it, or the falsity of evil, are. But the evil 
of falsity exists when a person, having in his own mind justified some evil and then concluded that it is no evil, goes on to do it. In this case the evil he does arises out of falsity. Take, for example, 
someone who, having justified adultery as a non-evil to his own satisfaction, goes on to commit it. The evil of falsity exists with him because his commission of it is due to a false assumption. 
It is in matters of religious belief that the evils of falsity exist primarily; for falsities contained in religious teachings convince a person that something is good when in fact it is bad, and sometimes 
that something is bad when in fact it is good.  </p>

`Super tertios et super quartos':  quod significet {1}damnationem falsorum et inde malorum, constat ex significatione `filiorum' quod sint falsa mali, de qua mox supra n. 10623; quod dicatur `super 
tertios et super quartos,' est quia tria praedicantur de veris {2}aut falsis, et quattuor de bonis {2}aut malis; in Verbo enim omnes numeri significant res, et quidam numeri {3} pertinent ad classem spiritualem, 
et quidam ad classem caelestem; numeri tria, sex, et duodecim ad classem spiritualem, et numeri duo, quattuor, et octo ad classem caelestem; numeri qui classis spiritualis sunt praedicantur 
de veris {4}aut falsis, qui ad caelestem de bonis {4}aut malis; per tria etiam significatur omne verum in complexu, et per quattuor omne bonum in complexu; inde est quod per `filios tertios et quartos' 
significentur falsa et inde mala; (m)sed hic sensus istorum verborum est sensus caelestis{5}, (n) quia exsurgit ex eo quod praedicentur de illis.  Quid mala et inde falsa, et quid falsa et inde mala, 
videatur in locis citatis n. 10109; etiam hic aliquid de malis et inde falsis, (c)ac de falsis et inde malis, dicetur:  mala sunt ex quibus omnia falsa, quoniam falsa sunt quae confirmant mala; et 
illa apud hominem unum agunt sicut {6} voluntas et intellectus, nam quod homo vult facere, hoc quoque vult intelligere, per intellectum enim format suum malum {7} coram se in cogitatione et coram aliis 
in loquela; {8} inde patet quid malum et inde falsum, seu falsum mali; malum falsi autem est quando homo confirmavit apud se malum, et conclusit quod non malum sit, et inde facit illud, tunc ex falso 
facit malum; sicut qui confirmavit apud se quod adulteria non sint mala et inde facit illa, is in malo falsi est, quia ex principio {9}falso facit illa; in religiosis praecipue dantur mala falsi, nam 
ex falsis doctrinae persuadet sibi homo quod bonum sit quod tamen malum, et quandoque quod malum sit quod tamen bonum. @1 falsa, et inde mala$ @2 i horum verborum$ @3 ac$ @4 i ibi$ @5 et$ @6
