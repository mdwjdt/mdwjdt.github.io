<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3512节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3512.</strong>“做成美味”表从来自这真理的愉悦所得来的渴望和快乐。这从“美味”的含义清楚可知，“美味”是指愉悦的形式（<a href="3502.htm">3502</a>），因而是指从由此，也就是说由这真理而来的愉悦所得来的渴望和快乐。因为如3502节所述，真理通过与其一致的愉悦形式而被引入人的属世层；未通过愉悦形式被引入的真理则不会在那里固定下来，因而不会通过对应关系与理性层联结。此外，和其它一切记忆知识一样，真理照着将其引进来的一切愉悦和快乐而在属于属世人的记忆中找到自己的位置。这一点从以下事实明显看出来：当这些愉悦和快乐重现时，通过它们被引进来的那些事物也会重现；反过来，在回想起这些事物的同时，与之相关的一切快乐和愉悦也被唤起。</p>

And make me dainties. That this signifies the desire and delight from the pleasantness thence, is evident from the signification of "dainties," as being what is pleasing (n. 3502), thus desire and delight 
from the pleasantness thereof, that is, from truth; for as before said in the number cited, truths are introduced into the natural of man by what is pleasing and in agreement therewith; and those 
which are not so introduced do not inhere, and thus are not conjoined with the rational by correspondence. Moreover, like all other memory-knowledges, truths are allotted their place in the memory that 
belongs to the natural man in accordance with the pleasant and delightful things that introduced them; as is evident from the fact that when these pleasant and delightful things return, the things 
that were introduced by them also return; and also on the other hand that when these things are recalled, there are at the same time excited the delightful and pleasant things to which they had been 
adjoined. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3512</b></p><p><b>3512.</b>
'And make me savoury food' means the desire and pleasure gained from the pleasantness received from that truth. This is clear from the meaning of 'savoury food' as forms of pleasantness, dealt with above 
in <a href="3502.htm">3502</a>, and so the desire and pleasure gained from the pleasantness received from this, that is to say, from truth. For as stated in the paragraph just referred to, truths are brought into man's 
natural by means of forms of pleasantness in keeping with it, and those that are not brought in by means of such forms do not attach themselves there and so are not joined to the rational by means of 
correspondence. Furthermore truths, like all other matters of knowledge, find their place in the memory belonging to the natural man according to all the pleasantness and delight that has brought them 
in. This is evident from the fact that when that pleasantness and delight reappears so do the things brought in by means of it; and conversely, when those things are recalled, so at the same time all 
the delight and pleasantness associated with them is aroused. </p>

</p><b>3512.</b>
`Et fac mihi cupedias': quod significet desiderium et delectationem ex amoenitate inde, constat ex significatione `cupediarum' quod sint amoena, de qua supra n. 3502, ita desiderium et delectatio ex 
amoenitate inde, nempe ex vero; nam ut in loco citato dictum est, vera in naturale hominis introducuntur per amoena ei convenientia, et quae non per amoena introducta sunt, non inhaerent, ita nec conjunguntur 
rationali per correspondentiam: etiam vera, sicut omnia alia scientifica, locum suum in memoria quae est naturalis hominis, sortiuntur secundum amoena et jucunda quae introduxerunt, ut patet 
ex eo quod eum amoena et jucunda illa redeunt, etiam res quae per illa introductae sunt, redeant, et quoque vicissim, cum res revocantur, etiam {1}jucunda seu amoena quibus adjunctae sunt, simul excitentur. @1
