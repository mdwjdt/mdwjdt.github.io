<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10602节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10602</strong>.“耶和华对摩西说”表关于以色列民族的结论。这从“说”的含义清楚可知。当耶和华对摩西“说”时，“说”是指回答，但在此是指一个结论；事实上，“说”包括了接下来的话，因为它们是祂所说的事，或在此正在宣称的事。所以此处“说”表示关于以色列民族的结论，这个结论是前两章论述的主题。这个结论就是，一个教会的确会建立在他们当中，圣言也将在他们当中写成，但他们的兴趣将在于外在事物，根本不在于内在之物。兴趣在于外在事物，不在于内在之物就是将外在事物拜为神圣，没有对主的任何承认，也没有为了神而对神的爱，只有为了自我而对神的爱；而这是爱自己、爱世界。事实上，这是背离神，而不是转向神。但由于他们能为了自己而处于一种外在神圣，而这种神圣能奇迹般地被与他们同在的灵人转化为一种为了神的外在神圣；并且这种神圣反过来能被天使从这些灵人那里接受，从而被提升到一种内在的神圣，所以这个民族被接纳。关于这个问题，可参看前文（<a href="10500.htm">10500</a>，<a href="10570.htm">10570</a>节）。这就是本章所包含，因而由“耶和华对摩西说”来表示的结论。</p>

And Jehovah said unto Moses. That this signifies the conclusion about the Israelitish nation, is evident from the signification of "said," when by Jehovah unto Moses, as being the answer, but here the 
conclusion, because "said" involves the things which follow, for they are the things He said, or that are said; here therefore by "said" is signified the conclusion about the Israelitish nation, which 
has been treated of in the two preceding chapters. The conclusion is that a church might indeed be instituted among them, and the Word be written among them, but that they would be merely in external 
things, and not at all in what is internal. To be in external things and not in what is internal is to worship external things as holy without any acknowledgment of the Lord, and without love to God 
for the sake of God, but for the sake of self; which is to love self and not God; nay, it is to turn one's self away from God, and not to turn one's self toward God. But as they could be in a holy external 
for the sake of self, and this could be miraculously converted by the spirits with them into a holy external for the sake of God, and as it could be received from these spirits by the angels, 
and thus be raised into a holy internal, therefore that nation was nevertheless received (as may be seen in n. 10500, 10570). This is the conclusion contained in this chapter, thus which is signified 
by "Jehovah said unto Moses." </p>

'And Jehovah said to Moses' means the conclusion regarding the Israelite nation. This is clear from the meaning of 'saying', when Jehovah talks to Moses, as an answer, or in this instance a conclusion; 
for 'said' includes the words that come after it, because they are what He actually said or what are being declared here. Here therefore 'said' means the conclusion regarding the Israelite nation that 
has been the subject in the two previous chapters. That conclusion was that a Church would indeed be established among them, and that the Word would be written among them, but that their interest 
would lie in external things and not in what was internal. People's interest lies in external things and not in what is internal when they venerate outward things but do not acknowledge the Lord or love 
God for His sake, only for their own sakes, which is a love of self and not of God. Indeed it is a turning away from God, not a turning towards Him. But since they were able to practise outward holiness 
for their own sakes, and that holiness could be wondrously converted by the spirits residing with them into an outward holiness for God's sake; and since this in turn could be received from those 
spirits by angels and so be raised to an inner holiness, that nation was accepted. On this matter, see <a href="10500.htm">10500</a>, <a href="10570.htm">10570</a>. This is the conclusion which the present chapter contains, thus which is meant by 
'Jehovah said to Moses'.  </p>

`Et dixit Jehovah ad Moschen':  quod significet conclusum de gente Israelitica, constat ex significatione `dicere' cum a Jehovah ad Moschen, quod sit responsum, hic autem conclusum, quoniam `dixit' 
involvit sequentia, quia illa sunt quae dixit seu quae dicuntur; hic itaque per `dixit' significatur conclusum de gente Israelitica, de qua in binis capitibus quae praecedunt actum est, conclusum est 
quod quidem Ecclesia apud illam institueretur, et Verbum apud illam conscriberetur, sed quod illi essent solum in externis et prorsus non in interno; esse in externis et non in interno est colere externa 
ut sancta, absque agnitione Domini, et absque amore in Deum propter Deum sed propter semet, quod est amare semet et non Deum; immo est avertere se a Deo et non convertere se ad Deum; sed quia in sancto 
externo potuerunt esse propter se, et hoc potuit miraculose converti in sanctum externum propter Deum per spiritus apud illos, et {1}ab his recipi ab angelis, et sic elevari in sanctum internum, 
ideo gens illa usque recepta est, de hac re videatur n. 10500, 10570.  Hoc conclusum est quod continetur in hoc capite, {2}ita quod significatur per `dixit Jehovah ad Moschen.' @1 inde$ @2 et quod ideo$ </p>
