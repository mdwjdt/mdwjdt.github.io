<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8670节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8670.</strong>“以及路上所遭遇的一切艰难”表试探中的劳苦。这从“艰难”和“路上所遭遇的一切”的含义清楚可知：“艰难”是指劳苦，“艰难”之所以表示劳苦，是因为它论及试探，在这些试探中，那些受试探的人劳苦对抗虚假和邪恶，天使也与他们一起劳苦，好把他们保守在信仰，因而保守在得胜的能力中；“路上所遭遇的一切”是指在试探方面，也就是说，在试探中的劳苦，因为“路上”表示在旷野中，就是前面所论述的他们经历试探的地方。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 8670</b></p><p><b>8670.</b>
All the trouble that had found them in the way. That this signifies labor in temptations, is evident from the signification of "trouble," as being labor-that "trouble" denotes labor is because it is 
predicated of temptations, for in these they who are tempted have labor against falsities and evils, and the angels also have labor with them to keep them in the faith, and thus in the power of conquering; 
and from the signification of "that had found them in the way," as being in respect to temptations (namely, labor), because "in the way," means in the wilderness, where they underwent temptations 
(of which above). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8670</b></p><p><b>8670.</b>
'All the distress that had come upon them on the way' means the toil in temptations. This is clear from the meaning of 'the distress' as the toil (the reason why 'the distress' means the toil is that 
it is used to refer to temptations, for in them the tempted are involved in toil against falsities and evils, and also the angels are involved in toil together with them to maintain them in faith and 
so in the power to be victorious); and from the meaning of 'that had come upon them on the way' as in regard to temptations, that is to say, the toil in them. For 'on the way' is in the wilderness where 
they underwent the temptations that have been the subject before now. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 8670</b>
</p><b>8670.</b>
`Omnem molestiam quae invenit illos in via': quod (x)significet laborem in tentationibus, constat ex significatione `molestiae' quod sit labor; quod `molestia' sit labor, est quia praedicatur de tentationibus, 
in {1}his enim est ipsis qui tentantur labor contra falsa et mala, et quoque angelis est labor cum illis ut in fide teneantur, et sic in potentia vincendi; et ex significatione `quae invenit 
illos in via' quod sit quoad tentationes, nempe labor, nam `in via' est in deserto ubi tentationes subiverunt, de quibus {2}prius. 	@1 illis$ 	@2 supra$ </p>
