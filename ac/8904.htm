<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8904节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8904.</strong>不可奸淫表不可败坏那些属于信与仁之教义的事物；因而不可利用圣言来支持虚假与邪恶；以及不可颠倒秩序的律法。这从“奸淫”、“淫乱”和“淫行”的含义清楚可知，“奸淫”、“淫乱”和“行淫”在灵义上是指玷污良善，歪曲属于信与仁之教义的真理。“奸淫”因表示这些事，故也表示利用圣言来支持邪恶与虚假；因为圣言构成最纯正的信与仁之教义本身；当圣言被用来支持虚假与邪恶时，那里的真理与良善就被败坏了。如今几乎没有人知道“奸淫”在灵义上表示这些事，因为如今在教会中，几乎没有人知道何为属灵领域，它与属世领域有何不同。几乎没有人知道这二者之间存在一种对应关系；事实上，这种对应关系具有这样的性质：这一个的形像就呈现在那一个里面，也就是说，属灵领域表现在属世领域中。因此，属灵领域就像灵魂，属世领域则像这个灵魂的身体；因此，它们通过流注和由此产生的结合而构成一个单一实体；正如也被称作属灵人的内在人与还被称作属世人的外在人在一个已重生的人里面构成一体。<br />现在的人对这些事一无所知，故不可能知道“奸淫”除了表示非法的肉体结合外还表示什么。由于现在的人对这些事一无所知，所以就让我们在此阐明“奸淫”在灵义上表示败坏那些属于信与仁之教义的事物，也就是玷污良善、歪曲真理的原因。这个原因如今是一个深藏的秘密，即：婚姻之爱是从被称为“天上婚姻”的良善与真理的婚姻那里降下来的。存在于天上的良善与真理之间的爱是从主流入的，并在地上变成婚姻之爱，这一切是通过对应发生的。这解释了为何就内义而言，“行淫”表示对真理的歪曲，“奸淫”表示对良善的玷污。这也解释了为何那些未处于信之良善和真理的人不可能拥有纯正的婚姻之爱在里面，又为何那些以奸淫为生活的乐趣之人再也无法获得信的任何事物。我曾听天使们说，一旦有人在地上犯了奸淫，并以此为乐，天堂就向他关闭，也就是说，他拒绝再从那里接受信或仁的任何事物。如今在教会所在的国家，许多人之所以轻视奸淫，是因为教会已经走到尽头，因此信不复存在，因为没有了仁；事实上，这一个对应于那一个。没有信的地方，虚假就会取代真理，邪恶则取代良善；由此产生的后果或态度是，奸淫不再被视为犯罪。因为当天堂在一个人那里关闭时，这种事或态度就会从地狱流入进来。关于这个主题，可参看前面的阐述和说明（<a href="2727.htm">2727</a>-<a href="2759.htm">2759</a>，<a href="4434.htm">4434</a>，<a href="4835.htm">4835</a>，<a href="4837.htm">4837</a>节）。<br />“奸淫”在内义或灵义上表示歪曲和玷污信与仁之真理与良善，因而也指错误利用圣言里的话来支持虚假与邪恶，这一点从圣言中提及“奸淫”、“行淫”的几处经文清楚看出来。这一点从以下经文明显可知，如以西结书：<br />人子啊，你要使耶路撒冷知道她那些可憎的事。你因你的名声就行淫，向路人纵情淫乱。你拿了你的一些衣服，为自己做成各色高地，又在那上头行淫；你拿我为装饰你所赐给你的金银所造的器皿，为自己制造男性的像，与他们行淫。你将给我所生的儿女祭献给它们。你的淫行岂是小事？你也和你那肉体肥大的邻邦埃及人行淫，加增你的淫乱，惹我发怒。你因贪色无厌，又与亚述人行淫，与他们行淫之后，仍不满足。并且多行淫乱直到那迦勒底的贸易之地，你仍不以此为满足。一个淫妇，虽服从丈夫，仍接纳外人。人都是把淫资送给妓女，你反倒把淫资赠送你所爱的人，贿赂他们从四围来与你行淫。所以妓女啊，要听耶和华的话。我要用奸淫和流人血的典章来审判你。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.2.htm">16:2</a>等）<br />若不知道“行淫”表示这些事，以及经上所说耶路撒冷与之“行淫”的“埃及人”、“亚述人”和“迦勒底”表示什么，谁能看出“行淫”在此表示对真理的歪曲和对良善的玷污？谁又能明白这段经文中的一个词。显然，耶路撒冷不会按字面那样与这些人本身行淫；故必须说明这些事物在内义上表示什么。“耶路撒冷”表示败坏的教会；“它的衣服”在此是指被歪曲的真理；因此，“各色高地”表示已经被承认或接受的虚假；“埃及人”是指记忆知识，“亚述人”是指推理，“迦勒底”是指对真理的亵渎。“衣服”表示真理（参看<a href="1073.htm">1073</a>，<a href="2576.htm">2576</a>，<a href="4545.htm">4545</a>，<a href="4763.htm">4763</a>，<a href="5248.htm">5248</a>，<a href="5319.htm">5319</a>，<a href="5954.htm">5954</a>，<a href="6914.htm">6914</a>，<a href="6918.htm">6918</a>节）；“高地”表示敬拜，“各色高地”在此表示对虚假的敬拜（<a href="796.htm">796</a>节）；“金银所造的装饰的器皿”是指关良善与真理的认知或知识，“器皿”是指知识或认知（参看<a href="3068.htm">3068</a>，<a href="3079.htm">3079</a>节）；“金”是指良善（<a href="113.htm">113</a>，<a href="1551.htm">1551</a>，<a href="1552.htm">1552</a>，<a href="5658.htm">5658</a>，<a href="6914.htm">6914</a>，<a href="6917.htm">6917</a>节）；“银”是指良善之真理（<a href="1551.htm">1551</a>，<a href="2048.htm">2048</a>，<a href="2954.htm">2954</a>，<a href="5658.htm">5658</a>节）；“男性的像”表示真理的形像和样式（<a href="2046.htm">2046</a>节）；“他们所生的儿女”表示他们所败坏的真理和良善，“儿子”是指真理（参看<a href="489.htm">489</a>，<a href="491.htm">491</a>，<a href="533.htm">533</a>，<a href="1147.htm">1147</a>，<a href="2623.htm">2623</a>，<a href="2803.htm">2803</a>，<a href="2813.htm">2813</a>，<a href="3373.htm">3373</a>节），“女儿”是指良善（参看<a href="489.htm">489</a>，<a href="2362.htm">2362</a>，<a href="3024.htm">3024</a>节）。“埃及人”是指记忆知识，败坏通过它们得以发生（参看<a href="1164.htm">1164</a>，<a href="1165.htm">1165</a>，<a href="1186.htm">1186</a>，<a href="1462.htm">1462</a>，<a href="2588.htm">2588</a>e，<a href="4749.htm">4749</a>，<a href="4964.htm">4964</a>，<a href="4966.htm">4966</a>，<a href="5700.htm">5700</a>，<a href="5702.htm">5702</a>，<a href="6004.htm">6004</a>，<a href="6015.htm">6015</a>，<a href="6125.htm">6125</a>，<a href="6651.htm">6651</a>，<a href="6679.htm">6679</a>，<a href="6683.htm">6683</a>，<a href="6692.htm">6692</a>，<a href="6750.htm">6750</a>，<a href="7296.htm">7296</a>，<a href="7779.htm">7779</a>，<a href="7926.htm">7926</a>节）；“亚述”是指推理，推理通过记忆知识败坏了信之真理，玷污了信之良善（参看<a href="119.htm">119</a>，<a href="1186.htm">1186</a>节）；“多行淫乱直到那迦勒底之地”是指甚至亵渎真理，“迦勒底”是指对真理的亵渎（<a href="1368.htm">1368</a>节）。由此明显可知为何他被称为“一个淫妇”和“妓女”。<br />在启示录，同样的话论及巴比伦：<br />拿着七香瓶的七位天使中，有一位来跟我讲话，对我说，来；我将坐在众水上的大淫妇所要受的审判指示你。地上的君王与她行淫，地上的居民喝醉了她淫乱的酒。大巴比伦，作地上的淫乱和可憎之物的母。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启17.1.htm">17:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启17.2.htm">2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启17.5.htm">5</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/启14.8.htm">14:8</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/启18.3.htm">18:3</a>）<br />“巴比伦”是指那些为了自己的统治权和利益而败坏教会的真理和良善，直到亵渎的地步之人，这一点从“巴比伦”（<a href="1182.htm">1182</a>，<a href="1283.htm">1283</a>，<a href="1295.htm">1295</a>，<a href="1304.htm">1304</a>，<a href="1306.htm">1306</a>-<a href="1308.htm">1308</a>，<a href="1321.htm">1321</a>，<a href="1322.htm">1322</a>，<a href="1326.htm">1326</a>，<a href="1327.htm">1327</a>e节）的含义明显可知。这解释了为何巴比伦被称为“淫妇或妓女”和“淫乱之母”。对内义一无所知的人会以为与她行淫的地上君王是指世上的国王或王国。然而，他们不是指国王或王国，而是指教会的信之真理，与这些“行淫”是指败坏它们。因为“王”表示信之真理（参看<a href="1672.htm">1672</a>，<a href="2015.htm">2015</a>，<a href="2069.htm">2069</a>，<a href="3009.htm">3009</a>，<a href="4575.htm">4575</a>，<a href="4581.htm">4581</a>，<a href="4966.htm">4966</a>，<a href="5044.htm">5044</a>，<a href="6148.htm">6148</a>节）；“地”表示教会（<a href="566.htm">566</a>，<a href="662.htm">662</a>，<a href="1067.htm">1067</a>，<a href="1262.htm">1262</a>，<a href="1413.htm">1413</a>，<a href="1607.htm">1607</a>，<a href="1733.htm">1733</a>，<a href="1850.htm">1850</a>，<a href="2117.htm">2117</a>，<a href="2118.htm">2118</a>e，<a href="2928.htm">2928</a>，<a href="3355.htm">3355</a>，<a href="4447.htm">4447</a>，<a href="4535.htm">4535</a>，<a href="5577.htm">5577</a>，<a href="8011.htm">8011</a>，<a href="8732.htm">8732</a>节）。“地上的居民喝醉了淫乱的酒”表示教会里的人通过邪恶所生的虚假被带入错误和疯狂的观念中；因为“喝醉”是指通过虚假的推理和对圣言的错解而被引入错误当中（<a href="1072.htm">1072</a>节）；“酒”是指邪恶所生的虚假（<a href="6377.htm">6377</a>节）；因此，“淫乱的酒”是指由对真理的歪曲所产生的虚假；“地”是指教会，如刚才所示。经上之所以说她“坐在众水上”，是因为“水”在正面意义上是指真理，在反面意义上是指虚假（<a href="729.htm">729</a>，<a href="790.htm">790</a>，<a href="8137.htm">8137</a>，<a href="8138.htm">8138</a>，<a href="8568.htm">8568</a>节）。<br />“奸淫”和“行淫”表示败坏教会的良善和真理，这一点也可从以西结书中的另一段经文很明显地看出来：<br />有两个女子，是一母的女儿，在埃及行淫；在幼年时行淫。阿荷拉就是撒马利亚，阿荷利巴就是耶路撒冷。阿荷拉在我手下行淫；贪恋所爱的人，就是她的邻邦亚述人，穿着紫衣，做总督、领袖，全都是可爱的少年人，骑着马的兵。她便在他们，就是亚述人中的精英身上放纵淫行。她从埃及的时候，就没有离弃过淫乱；因为她年轻时，有人与她同寝。阿荷利巴闹恋爱却比她更腐败，她的淫乱比姐姐的淫乱更甚。她贪恋亚述人。阿荷利巴又加增淫行，因她看见人像画在墙上，就是用丹色所画迦勒底人的像；阿荷利巴一眼看见，就恋上了他们。巴比伦人也来到她那里，登上爱情的床；以他们的淫行玷污了她。然而她还加增她的淫行，追念她幼年在埃及地行淫的日子。她比他们的妾还要贪恋他们。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结23.2.htm">23:2</a>等）<br />在这段经文中，若不知道“埃及人”、“亚述人”或“亚述之子”、“迦勒底”和“巴比伦”表示什么，没有人能看出“淫行”表示属灵的淫行，也就是对良善的玷污和对真理的歪曲，这些良善和真理是教会所拥有的；此处内义所包含的事也不会变得显而易见。显然，所指的不是这些民族，而是诸如属于虚假的那类事物；因为撒玛利亚和耶路撒冷的居民并未与他们行淫。不过，刚才已经说明“埃及”、“亚述”、“迦勒底”和“巴比伦”表示什么。<br />从以下经文也明显可知“淫行或淫像”和“奸淫或淫态”在内义上是指对良善和真理的歪曲和败坏，因而是指对它们的玷污，如何西阿书：<br />你们要与你们的母亲大大争辩，因为她不是我的妻子，我也不是她的丈夫。叫她除掉脸上的淫像和胸间的淫态。我必不怜悯她的儿女，因为他们是从淫乱的儿女。他们的母亲行了淫乱，说，我要随从我所爱的，就是那给我饼、水、羊毛、麻、油、酒的。我也必毁坏她的葡萄树和无花果树，就是她说，这是我所爱的给我的淫资。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何2.2.htm">2:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/何2.4.htm">4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/何2.5.htm">5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/何2.12.htm">12</a>）<br />此处“母亲”在内义上表示教会（<a href="289.htm">289</a>，<a href="2691.htm">2691</a>，<a href="2717.htm">2717</a>，<a href="4257.htm">4257</a>，<a href="5581.htm">5581</a>，<a href="8897.htm">8897</a>节）；“妻子”也是（<a href="252.htm">252</a>，<a href="253.htm">253</a>，<a href="409.htm">409</a>，<a href="749.htm">749</a>，<a href="770.htm">770</a>节）；不过，经上说她“不是妻子”，因为她沉浸于败坏的真理，也就是沉浸于虚假；“儿女”或“儿子”是指教会的真理，在此是指虚假，因为他们被称为“淫乱的儿女”（<a href="489.htm">489</a>，<a href="491.htm">491</a>，<a href="533.htm">533</a>，<a href="2623.htm">2623</a>，<a href="2803.htm">2803</a>，<a href="2813.htm">2813</a>，<a href="3373.htm">3373</a>，<a href="3704.htm">3704</a>，<a href="4257.htm">4257</a>节）。至于“饼”、“水”、“羊毛和麻”，以及“油和酒”，还有“葡萄树和无花果树”分别表示什么，这在它们自己的地方已经说明；即：它们是指爱与仁之良善；但反面意义上是指虚假与邪恶；因为当它们被败坏时，良善就变成了邪恶，真理就变成了虚假。至于“饼”表示什么，可参看前文（<a href="276.htm">276</a>，<a href="680.htm">680</a>，<a href="2165.htm">2165</a>，<a href="2177.htm">2177</a>，<a href="3464.htm">3464</a>，<a href="3478.htm">3478</a>，<a href="3735.htm">3735</a>，<a href="3813.htm">3813</a>，<a

href="886.htm">886</a>，<a href="3728.htm">3728</a>，<a href="4582.htm">4582</a>节）；“酒”表示什么（<a href="3069.htm">3069</a>，<a href="3168.htm">3168</a>，<a href="3772.htm">3772</a>，<a href="8562.htm">8562</a>节）；“葡萄树”表示什么（<a href="1069.htm">1069</a>，<a href="5113.htm">5113</a>，<a href="6376.htm">6376</a>节）；“无花果树”表示什么（<a href="4231.htm">4231</a>，<a href="5113.htm">5113</a>节）。“淫资”是指他们试图视之为真理的教义中的虚假。<br />同一先知书：<br />我的民求问木头，他们的杖给他们答复，因为行淫的灵使他们失迷，他们就在他们的神之下行淫。他们在各山顶献祭，在各山冈烧香，所以，你们的女儿就行淫，你们的儿妇就犯了奸淫。我不因你们的女儿行淫 或你们的儿妇犯奸淫惩罚她们； 因为人自己与娼妓同分， 与妓女一同献祭。以色列啊，你虽然行淫，犹大却不可犯罪。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何4.12.htm">4:12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/何4.16.htm">16</a>）<br />“在他们的神之下行淫”表示歪曲真理，因为“神”在内义上表示真理，在反面意义上表示虚假（<a href="2586.htm">2586</a>，<a href="2769.htm">2769</a>，<a href="2807.htm">2807</a>，<a href="2822.htm">2822</a>，<a href="4295.htm">4295</a>，<a href="4402.htm">4402</a>，<a href="4544.htm">4544</a>，<a href="7010.htm">7010</a>，<a

href="1691.htm">1691</a>，<a href="2722.htm">2722</a>，<a href="6435.htm">6435</a>节）；所“求问”的“木头”是指与属于某种欲望的快乐有关的良善（<a href="643.htm">643</a>节）；“给答复”的“杖”是指看似来自人自己的理解力的幻觉力量（<a href="4013.htm">4013</a>，<a href="4015.htm">4015</a>，<a href="4876.htm">4876</a>，<a href="4936.htm">4936</a>，<a href="7011.htm">7011</a>，<a href="7026.htm">7026</a>节）。由于“神”在正面意义上表示真理，在反面意义上表示虚假，所以他们行邪淫，随从外邦的神，如随从巴力，摩洛，偶像（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利20.5.htm">20:5</a>；以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结6.9.htm">6:9</a>；以及别处）就表示歪曲真理和玷污良善。<br />由此可见以下经文中“奸淫或奸夫”和“行淫或淫妇”表示什么：<br />你们这些巫婆的儿子，奸夫和淫妇的种子，都要前来！你们向谁戏笑、向谁张口吐舌呢？你们岂不是悖逆所生的、虚谎之种呢？你们在各青翠树下的神明中间欲火焚烧。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛57.3.htm">57:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛57.5.htm">5</a>）<br />以赛亚书：<br />七十年终了以后，耶和华必眷顾推罗，她就仍得淫资，面对世界与地上的众国行淫。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛23.17.htm">23:17</a>）<br />耶利米书：<br />人若休妻，妻离他而去，成了别人的；但你和许多情郎行淫。你竟用你的淫行和邪恶把这地都玷污了。背道的以色列所行的，你看见没有？她上了各高山，到了在各青翠树下，在那里行淫。她奸诈的妹妹犹大也去行淫，以致她用行淫的声音玷污这地；和石头木头行淫。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶3.1.htm">3:1</a>，<a

/>这是你的阄分，因为你忘记了我，倚靠虚假。你那些可憎恶之事，就是你在田野、在小山上的奸淫，嘶声，淫乱的的恶行，我都看见了。耶路撒冷啊，你有祸了！（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶13.25.htm">13:25</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶13.27.htm">27</a>）<br /><br />论到那些先知，地满了行奸淫的人；因受咒诅，地就悲哀，旷野的草场都枯干了。连先知带祭司，都假冒为善。我在耶路撒冷的先知中曾见可怕的顽固，他们行奸淫，行在虚谎中；又坚固恶人的手。他们所说的异象，是出于自己的心，不是出于耶和华的口。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶23.9.htm">23:9</a>-<a

href="http://39-27.cn/耶29.23.htm">29:23</a>）<br />从这些经文很明显地看出，“行奸淫”表示出于自己的心，也就是人的自我，因而照着对自我和世界的爱所指示的来解释并歪曲圣言的真理；因此，这就是说谎，也就是说虚假，如经上明确说明的。何西阿书：<br />以色列啊！不要欢喜！因为你在你神之下行了淫，在各谷场上喜爱妓女的淫资。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何9.1.htm">9:1</a>）<br /><br />耶和华对何西阿说，你去娶淫妇为妻，也收那从淫乱的儿女；因为这地大行淫乱，离弃耶和华。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何1.2.htm">1:2</a>）<br />那鸿书：<br />祸哉！这流人血的城，都因那美貌的妓女，行邪术的主母多有淫行，借淫行卖列族，用邪术卖各家族。（那鸿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/鸿3.1.htm">3:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/鸿3.4.htm">4</a>）<br />民数记：<br />你们的儿女必在旷野飘流四十年，担当你们的淫行；按你们窥探那地的天数，一天顶一年。你们要担当罪孽四十年。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民14.33.htm">14:33</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民14.34.htm">34</a>）<br />由于对真理的歪曲和良善的玷污对应于地上的淫行，所以奸夫淫妇受到的惩罚就是死刑（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利20.10.htm">20:10</a>）；做祭司的人的女儿因行淫辱没了自己，必被火烧（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利21.9.htm">21:9</a>）；以色列的女儿不可暴露于淫乱（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利19.29.htm">19:29</a>）。同样，私生子不可入耶和华的会，直到他的十代（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申23.2.htm">23:2</a>）；娼妓所得的钱不可带入耶和华的殿，因为这是可憎恶的（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申23.18.htm">23:18</a>）。<br />从这些经文能充分看出“奸淫”表示什么，即：在外在意义上，它是指犯奸淫；但在内在代表意义上，它是指通过教会所拥有的那类事物来拜偶像和别神，因而是指外在和内在的偶像崇拜行为；不过，在内在灵义上它是指对良善的玷污和对真理的歪曲。这一切清楚表明为何奸淫本身如此邪恶，令人作呕，被称为可憎的；也就是说，它们这样是因为，它们对应于虚假与邪恶的的婚姻，也就是地狱的婚姻。另一方面，这一切也表明为何真正的婚姻是神圣的，即因以下事实：它们对应于良善与真理的婚姻，也就是天上的婚姻。事实上，真正的婚姻之爱是从良善与真理的婚姻降下来的，因而是出于天堂，也就是经由天堂从主而来；而奸淫之爱源于虚假与邪恶的婚姻，因而源于地狱，也就是源于魔鬼。</p>

Thou shalt not commit adultery. That this signifies that those things which are of the doctrine of faith and of charity are not to be perverted, thus that the Word is not to be applied to confirm falsities 
and evils, also that the laws of order are not to be upset, is evident from the signification of "committing adultery," "debauching," and "whoredom," as being in the spiritual or internal sense, 
to pervert the goods, and falsify the truths, which are of the doctrine of faith and of charity. And as these things are signified by "committing adultery," there is also signified to apply the Word 
to confirm evils and falsities; for the Word is the very doctrine itself of faith and charity, and the perversion of the truth and good of the Word is its application to falsities and evils. That these 
things are signified by "committing adultery" and "debauching" in the spiritual sense, is known to scarcely anyone at this day, for the reason that within the church few now know what the spiritual 
is, and in what respect it differs from the natural. And scarcely anyone knows that there is a correspondence between the two, and indeed of such a nature that the image of the one is presented in the 
other, that is, the spiritual is represented in the natural, consequently that the spiritual is like a soul, and the natural is like its body; and thus that through influx and the consequent conjunction 
they constitute a one; as in the regenerate man do his internal man which is also called spiritual, and his external man which is also called natural. [2] Such things being at this day unknown, 
it therefore cannot be known what is signified by "committing adultery," further than being unlawfully conjoined as to the body. These things, as has been said, being at this day unknown, the reason may 
be told why "committing adultery" in the spiritual sense signifies to pervert those things which are of the doctrine of faith and charity, thus to adulterate goods and falsify truths. The reason, which 
at this day is a secret one, is that conjugial love descends from the marriage of good and truth, which is called "the heavenly marriage." The love which flows in from the Lord and which exists between 
good and truth in heaven, is turned into conjugial love on the earth, and this by correspondence. Hence it is that the falsification of truth is "whoredom," and the perversion of good is "adulteration," 
in the internal sense. Hence also it is that they who are not in the good and truth of faith cannot be in genuine conjugial love; and also that those who find the delight of life in adulteries 
can no longer receive anything of faith. I have heard it said by the angels that as soon as anyone commits adultery on the earth and takes delight in it, heaven is closed to him, that is, he refuses 
any longer to receive from heaven anything of faith and charity. That at this day in the kingdoms where the church is, adulteries are made light of by very many persons, is because the church is at 
its end, and thus there is no longer any faith, because there is no charity; for the one corresponds to the other. Where there is no faith, falsity is in the place of truth, and evil is in the place of 
good, and from this there flows the result that adulteries are no longer accounted as criminal; for when heaven is closed with a man, such things flow in from hell. (See what has been said and shown 
before on this subject, n. 2727-2759, 4434, 4835, 4837.) [3] That "to debauch," and "to commit adultery," in the internal or spiritual sense denote to falsify and to pervert the truths and goods of 
faith and charity, consequently also to confirm falsity and evil by wrong applications from the Word, can be seen from the several passages in the Word where mention is made of "committing adultery," 
of "debauching," and of "committing whoredom;" as will plainly appear from the following passages; as in Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations. Thou didst commit whoredom 
because of thy name, and didst pour out thy whoredoms on everyone that passed by. Thou didst take of thy garments, and didst make for thee high places of various colors, and didst commit whoredom upon 
them. Thou didst take the vessels of thine adornment of My gold and of My silver, which I had given thee, and madest for thee images of a male; thou didst commit whoredom with them. Thou hast taken 
thy sons and thy daughters, whom thou hast borne unto Me, and these hast thou sacrificed. Was there little of thy whoredoms? Thou hast committed whoredom with the sons of Egypt, thy neighbors, great of 
flesh; and hast multiplied thy whoredom to provoke Me. And thou hast committed whoredom with the sons of Asshur, when thou wast insatiable; yea, thou hast committed whoredom with them, and yet thou 
wast not sated. And thou hast multiplied thy whoredom, even unto the land of traffic, unto Chaldea; and yet in this thou wast not sated. A woman, an adulteress under her man, taketh strangers. They give 
hire to all harlots; but thou hast given hirings to all thy lovers, and hast recompensed them, that they may come unto thee from every side for thy whoredoms. Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word of 
Jehovah. I will judge thee with the judgments of adulteresses, and of the shedders of blood (Ezek. 16:2, and following verses). [4] Who cannot see that by "whoredoms" here are signified falsifications 
of truth and adulterations of good? And who can understand a syllable of the passage unless he knows that "whoredom" has such a signification; also unless he knows what is meant by "the sons of Egypt," 
by "the sons of Asshur," and by "Chaldea," with whom Jerusalem is said to have "committed whoredom?" That she did not do this with those peoples themselves is manifest. It must therefore be told what 
these things signify in the internal sense. By "Jerusalem" is meant the church perverted; her "garments" here denote truths which are perverted; consequently the falsities which are acknowledged are 
"the high places of various colors;" "the sons of Egypt" denote memory-knowledges; "the sons of Asshur," reasonings; "Chaldea," the profanation of truth (that "garments" denote truths, see n. 1073, 
2576, 4545, 4763, 5248, 5319, 5954, 6914, 6918; that "high places" denote worship, and "the high places of various colors," here, the worship of falsity, n. 796); "vessels of adornment of gold and of 
silver" denote the knowledges of good and truth (that "vessels" denote knowledges, see n. 3068, 3079; that "gold" denotes good, n. 113, 1551, 1552, 5658, 6914, 6917; and "silver," the truth of good, 
n. 1551, 2048, 2954, 5658); "images of a male" signify appearances and likenesses of truth (n. 2046); "the sons and daughters whom they bare" denote the truths and goods which they have perverted. (That 
"sons" denote truths, see n. 489, 491, 533, 1147, 2623, 2803, 2813, 3373; and that "daughters" denote goods, see n. 489, 2362, 3024; that "the sons of Egypt" denote the memory-knowledges through which 
is perversion, see n. 1164, 1165, 1186, 1462, 2588, 4749, 4964, 4966, 5700, 5702, 6004, 6015, 6125, 6651, 6679, 6683, 6692, 6750, 7296, 7779, 7926; that "Asshur" denotes the reasoning through which 
by means of memory-knowledges the truths of faith are perverted, and the goods thereof adulterated, see n. 119, 1186; and that "multiplying whoredom even unto the land of Chaldea" denotes even to the 
profanation of truth; also that "Chaldea" denotes the profanation of truth, n. 1368); from this it is plain why she is called "a woman an adulteress," and also "a harlot." [5] In like manner we read 
of Babylon in Revelation: </p>
<p>     There came one of the seven angels that had the seven vials, and spake with me, saying to me, Come, I will show thee the judgment of the great harlot that sitteth upon 
many waters; with whom the kings of the earth have committed whoredom, and the inhabitants of the earth were made drunken with the wine of her whoredom. It was Babylon the great, the mother of the harlots 
and of the abominations of the earth (Rev. 17:1, 2, 5; 14:8; 18:3). That "Babylon" denotes those who pervert the truths and goods of the church for the sake of self-dominion and of self-gain, 
and this even to profanation, is evident from the signification of "Babel" (n. 1182, 1283, 1295, 1304, 1306-1308, 1321, 1322, 1326, 1327). Hence it is that Babylon is called "a harlot" and "the mother 
of harlots." They who know nothing of the internal sense will believe that the kings of the earth who committed whoredom with her signified kings upon the earth, or kingdoms. Yet they do not signify 
kings, or kingdoms, but the truths of faith of the church, to "commit whoredom" with which denotes to pervert them. (That "kings" denote the truths of faith, see n. 1672, 2015, 2069, 3009, 4575, 4581, 
4966, 5044, 6148; and that "the earth" denotes the church, n. 566, 662, 1067, 1262, 1413, 1607, 1733, 1850, 2117, 2118, 2928, 3355, 4447, 4535, 5577, 8011, 8732.) "The inhabitants of the earth made drunk 
with the wine of whoredom" denotes that they who were within the church were brought into errors and ravings through the falsities of evil; for to be "made drunken" denotes to be led into errors 
through false reasonings and wrong interpretations of the Word (n. 1072). "Wine" denotes falsity from evil (n. 6377); consequently "the wine of whoredom" denotes falsity from the perversion of truth. 
That "earth" denotes the church has just been shown; she is said to "sit upon many waters," because upon falsities, for in the genuine sense "waters" denote truths, and in the opposite sense, falsities 
(n. 729, 790, 8137, 8138, 8568). [6] That "to commit adultery and whoredom" denotes to pervert the goods and the truths of the church, is plainly evident also from another passage in Ezekiel: </p>
<p>    
 Two women, the daughters of one mother, committed whoredom in Egypt; they committed whoredom in their youth. Oholah is Samaria, and Oholibah is Jerusalem. Oholah committed whoredom under Me; and she 
doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians her neighbors, clothed in blue, governors and leaders, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding on horses. She bestowed her whoredoms upon them, the choice 
of all the sons of Asshur. Yet she forsook not her whoredoms from Egypt; for they lay with her in her youth. Oholibah was more corrupt in her love than she, and in her whoredoms above the whoredoms 
of her sister. She doted on the sons of Asshur. She added to her whoredoms, when she saw men portrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans portrayed with vermilion, and she loved them at the look 
of her eyes. The sons of Babel also came to her unto the copulation of loves; they defiled her with their whoredom. Yet she multiplied her whoredoms, while she remembered the days of her youth, wherein 
she had committed whoredom in the land of Egypt. She doted on them more than their courtesans (Ezek. 23:2 and following verses). In this passage also no one can fail to see that by "whoredoms" are 
meant spiritual whoredoms, that is, perversions of the good, and falsifications of the truth, which are of the church; also that the things here contained in the internal sense are not manifest unless 
it is known what is signified by "the sons of Egypt," by "the Assyrians" or "the sons of Asshur," by "Chaldea," and by "Babel;" for it is clear that these nations are not meant, but such things as 
are of falsity; because the inhabitants of Samaria and Jerusalem did not commit whoredom with them. But what is signified by "Egypt," "Asshur," "Chaldea," and "Babylon" can be seen shown just above. [7] 
From the following passages also it is evident that "whoredoms" and "adulteries" in the internal sense denote falsifications and perversions of good and truth, thus adulterations of these; as in 
Hosea: </p>
<p>     Strive ye with your mother, strive ye, because she is not My wife, and I am not her husband; that she may remove her whoredoms from her faces, and her adulteries from between her breasts. 
I will not have mercy on her sons; because they are sons of whoredoms. For their mother hath committed whoredom, saying, I will go after my lovers, that give me my bread and my water, my wool and my 
flax, mine oil and my drinks. But I will lay waste her vine and her fig-tree, whereof she hath said, These are my harlot-hire that my lovers have given me (Hos. 2:2, 4, 5, 12). By "mother" in the internal 
sense is here meant the church (n. 289, 2691, 2717, 4257, 5581, 8897); in like manner by "wife" (n. 252, 253, 409, 749, 770), who is said "not to be a wife," because in truths perverted, that is, 
in falsities; by "sons" are meant the truths of the church, here falsities, because they are called "sons of whoredoms" (n. 489, 491, 533, 2623, 2803, 2813, 3373, 3704, 4257). What is meant by "bread," 
what by "water," what by "wool and flax," also by "oil and drink," and likewise by "vine and fig-tree," has been shown in their places; namely, that they are the goods of love and of charity, also 
the goods and truths of faith interior and exterior; but in the opposite sense evils and falsities; for goods become evils, and truths become falsities, when they are perverted. (What is meant by "bread," 
see n. 276, 680, 2165, 2177, 3464, 3478, 3735, 3813, 4217, 4735, 4976, 5915, 6118, 6409; also what by "waters," n. 739, 790, 8137, 8138, 8568; what by "flax," n. 7601; and what by "oil," n. 886, 
3728, 4582; what by "drink," n. 3069, 3168, 3772, 8562; what by "vine," n. 1069, 5113, 6376; and what by "fig-tree," n. 4231, 5113.) "Harlot-hire" denotes the falsity of doctrine which they vaunt as 
truth. [8] In the same: </p>
<p>     My people asketh wood, and their staff answereth to it, because the spirit of whoredom hath led them astray, and they have committed whoredom from under their god. They 
sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, therefore your daughters commit whoredom, and your daughters-in-law commit adultery. If thou, Israel, committest whoredom, let 
not Judah become guilty. Shall I not visit upon your daughters, because they commit whoredom, and upon your daughters-in-law, because they commit adultery? for they divide with whores, and they sacrifice 
with prostitutes (Hos. 4:12-16). "To commit whoredom from under their god" denotes to pervert truth, for by "god" in the internal sense is signified truth, and in the opposite sense, falsity (n. 
2586, 2769, 2807, 2822, 4295, 4402, 4544, 7010, 7268, 7873, 8301, 8867); "mountains and hills" denotes loves, here the loves of self and of the world (n. 795, 796, 1691, 2722, 6435); "the wood of which 
counsel is asked" denotes the good of the delight of some cupidity (n. 643); "the staff which answereth" denotes imaginary power from one's own intellectual (n. 4013, 4015, 4876, 4936, 7011, 7026). 
As "gods" in the genuine sense signify truths, and in the opposite sense falsities, therefore falsifying truths and adulterating goods is signified by: </p>
<p>     They have gone a whoring after strange gods, 
as after Baal, after Molech, after idols (Ezek. 6:9; Lev. 20:5; and elsewhere). [9] From all this it can now he seen what is meant by "adulteries" and "whoredoms" in the following passages: </p>
<p>   
  Come hither, ye sons of the sorceress, the seed of the adulterer, and she hath committed whoredom; against whom do ye delight yourselves? against whom make ye wide the mouth, and thrust out the tongue? 
are ye not born of transgression, a seed of a lie, who have been hated among gods under every green tree? (Isa. 57:3-5).      It shall come to pass at the end of seventy years, Jehovah will visit 
Tyre, that it may return to its harlot-hire, and commit whoredom with all the kingdoms of the earth upon the faces of the world (Isa. 23:17).      And a man put away his wife, and she went from him, 
and was another man's; she committed whoredom with many companions. Thou hast profaned the land with thy whoredoms and with thy wickedness. Hast thou seen what backsliding Israel hath done? She goeth 
away upon every high mountain, and under every green tree, and thou committest whoredom there. Moreover her treacherous sister Judah went away, and she also committed whoredom, insomuch that she hath 
profaned the land by the voice of her whoredom; she hath committed debauchery with stone and with wood (Jer. 3:1, 2, 6, 8, 9).      This is thy lot, because thou hast forgotten Me, and trusted in a 
lie; thine adulteries, and thy neighings, the wickedness of thy whoredom, on the hills in the field I have seen thine abominations. Woe to thee, O Jerusalem (Jer. 13:25, 27).      Against the prophets: 
The land is full of adulterers; for because of the curse the land mourneth; the pastures of the wilderness have dried up, because both prophet and priest practice hypocrisy. In the prophets of Jerusalem 
also I have seen a horrible stubbornness, in committing adultery and walking in a lie; they have strengthened the hands of the evil; they speak a vision of their heart, not out of the mouth of Jehovah 
(Jer. 23:9-11, 14, 16).      They have wrought folly in Israel, and have committed debauchery with the wives of their companions, and have spoken a word in My name falsely, which I commanded them 
not (Jer. 29:23). [10] From these passages it is very manifest that "to commit adultery," and "to debauch," denote to explain and pervert the truths of the Word from one's own heart, that is, from 
one's own, in such a manner as the loves of self and of the world persuade one to do; consequently it is to speak lies, that is, falsities, as is openly said. Again: </p>
<p>     Be not glad, O Israel, because 
thou hast committed whoredom from under thy God, thou hast loved harlot-hire upon all the cornfloors (Hos. 9:1).      Jehovah spake unto Hosea, Go, take unto thee a woman of whoredoms and children 
of whoredoms; because in whoring the land doth commit whoredom from behind Jehovah (Hos. 1:2).      Woe to the city of bloods! Because of the multitude of the whoredoms of the well-favored harlot, 
the mistress of sorceries, that selleth nations through her whoredoms, and families through her sorceries (Nah. 3:1, 4).      Your sons shall be feeders in the wilderness forty years, and they shall 
bear your whoredoms forty years; according to the number of the days in which ye spied out the land, for every day a year, shall ye bear your iniquities (Num. 14:33, 34). [11] Inasmuch as falsifications 
of truth and adulterations of good corresponded to whoredoms on the earth, therefore the penalty of death was for adulterers (Lev. 20:10); and the daughter of a man who was a priest, if she profaned 
herself by committing whoredom, was to be burnt with fire (Lev. 21:9); also no daughter in Israel was to be exposed to whoredom (Lev. 19:19). In like manner a bastard was not to come into the congregation 
of Jehovah, not even his tenth generation (Deut. 23:2); and the hire of a harlot was not to be brought into the house of Jehovah, because it is an abomination (Deut. 23:18). [12] From these 
passages it can now be fully seen what is signified by "committing adultery," namely, that in the external sense it is to commit adulteries; in the internal representative sense it is to worship idols 
and other gods by means of such things as are of the church, consequently idolatry external and internal; but in the internal spiritual sense are signified adulterations of good and perversions of truth. 
From all this it is plainly evident whence it is that adulteries are in themselves so wicked, and are called "abominations," namely, from the fact that they correspond to the marriage of falsity 
and evil, which is the infernal marriage; and on the other hand, why genuine marriages are holy, namely, from the fact that they correspond to the marriage of good and truth, which is the heavenly marriage. 
Nay, genuine conjugial love descends from the marriage of good and truth, thus out of heaven, that is, through heaven from the Lord; whereas the love of adultery is from the marriage of falsity 
and evil, thus from hell, that is, from the devil. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8904</b></p><p><b>8904.</b>
'You shall not commit adultery' means that what belongs to teachings about faith and charity must not be perverted, thus that the Word must not be used to lend support to falsities and evils, also that 
the laws of order must not be turned upside down This is clear from the meaning of 'committing adultery'<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> and 'committing whoredom.' In the internal or spiritual sense they mean perverting the forms 
of good and falsifying the truths that belong to teachings about faith and charity. And since these things are meant by 'committing adultery', using the Word to lend support to evils and falsities is 
also meant, since the Word constitutes the most genuine teachings about faith and charity, and truth and good there are perverted when used to support falsities and evils. Scarcely anyone at the present 
day knows that these things are meant 'by committing adultery' in the spiritual sense, because few people within the Church at the present day know what the spiritual realm is and how it differs 
from the natural. And scarcely anyone knows of the correspondence that exists between the two, which indeed is such that an image of the one presents itself in the other, that is, the spiritual realm 
is represented in the natural. Consequently the spiritual exists as a soul and the natural as its body, so that through influx and the joining together that results they constitute a single entity, just 
as the internal man, also called the spiritual man, and the external man, also referred to as the natural man, make one in a person who has been regenerated.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Since people nowadays are ignorant 
of such matters they cannot know what else 'committing adultery' means beyond unlawful bodily coupling. Because people nowadays are ignorant of these matters, as has been said, let the reason be stated 
here why 'committing adultery' in the spiritual sense means perverting what belongs to teachings about faith and charity, that is, adulterating forms of good and falsifying truths. That reason, 
which is deeply hidden at the present day, is that conjugial love descends from the marriage of goodness and truth, called the heavenly marriage. The love existing between goodness and truth in heaven 
flows in from the Lord and changes into conjugial love on earth; and this happens through correspondence. This explains why the falsification of truth is meant by 'whoredom' in the internal sense, and 
the perversion of good by 'adultery'. It also explains why those who are not governed by the goodness and truth of faith cannot have genuine conjugial love within them, and why those who experience 
the delight of life in adulterous relationships can no longer receive anything of faith. I have heard it said by angels that as soon as anyone commits adultery on earth and takes delight in doing so, 
heaven is closed to him, that is, he refuses to receive any longer from there anything of faith or charity. The reason why at the present day in countries where the Church exists very many people make 
light of adulterous relationships is that the Church is at its end, and so there is no longer any faith because there is no charity; for the one corresponds to the other. Where no faith exists there 
is falsity instead of truth and evil instead of good; and from this flows attitudes in which adultery is no longer considered to be an offence. For when heaven has been closed with a person such attitudes 
flow in from hell. See what has been stated and shown previously on these matters in <a href="2727.htm">2727</a>-<a href="2759.htm">2759</a>, <a href="4434.htm">4434</a>, <a href="4835.htm">4835</a>, <a href="4837.htm">4837</a>. </p>

<p><b>[3]</b>
 The meaning of 'committing adultery' in the internal or spiritual sense as 
falsifying and perverting the truths and forms of the good of faith and charity, and therefore also lending support to falsity and evil by using statements in the Word wrongly, becomes clear from individual 
places in the Word in which 'committing adultery' and 'committing whoredom' are mentioned. That meaning will be plainly evident from places quoted below, as in Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
Son of man, make known 
to Jerusalem her abominations. You committed whoredom because of your renown, and poured out your acts of whoredom on every passer-by. You took some of your garments and made for yourself high places 
variously coloured, and on them committed whoredom. For your adornment you took vessels made of My gold and of My silver, which I had given you, and made for yourself figures of the male; you committed 
whoredom with them. You took your sons and your daughters, whom you had borne to Me, and sacrificed them to them. Were your acts of whoredom a small matter? You committed whoredom with the sons of 
Egypt, your neighbours, great in flesh, and multiplied your whoredom to provoke Me to anger. And you committed whoredom with the sons of Asshur, since you were insatiable; with them you indeed committed 
whoredom and were not satisfied. And you multiplied your whoredom, even as far as the trading land of Chaldea; and yet you were not satisfied with this. An adulterous woman - though subject to her 
husband, she takes strangers. To all harlots [men] make payments; but you have made payments to all your lovers, and have bribed them to come to you from all around for your whorings. Therefore, O harlot, 
hear the word of Jehovah. I will judge you with the judgements of adulteresses and of shedders of blood. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2016:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 16:1</a>

 Is there anyone who cannot see that falsifications of truth and adulterations 
of good are meant here by 'acts of whoredom'? And is there anyone who can understand a single word here unless he knows that such things are meant by 'whoredom', and also unless he knows what 
is meant by 'the sons of Egypt', 'the sons of Asshur', and 'Chaldea', with whom Jerusalem is said to have committed whoredom? Jerusalem, it is obvious, did not literally commit whoredom with those 
actual peoples; therefore what the things in this passage mean in the internal sense must be stated. 'Jerusalem' is used to mean the perverted Church, 'its garments' here being truths that are perverted; 
and therefore falsities that are accepted are meant by 'high places variously coloured'. 'The sons of Egypt' are factual knowledge, 'the sons of Asshur' are reasoning, and 'Chaldea' is the profanation 
of truth.

used. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 Something similar is said about 'Babylon', in the Book of Revelation, </p>
<blockquote>
One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and spoke to me, saying to me, Come, I will show you the judgement 
of the great harlot who is seated on many waters, with whom the kings of the earth have committed whoredom, and with the wine of whose whoredom the inhabitants of the earth have become drunk Babylon 
the great was the mother of whores and of the abominations of the earth. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2017:1,%202,%205;%2014:8;%2018:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 17:1, 2, 5; 14:8; 18:3</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Babylon' is those who pervert the Church's truths and forms of good for the sake of their 
own dominion and gain, perverting them to the point of profanation, as is clear from the meaning of 'Babel' in <a href="1182.htm">1182</a>, <a href="1283.htm">1283</a>, <a href="1295.htm">1295</a>, <a href="1304.htm">1304</a>, <a href="1306.htm">1306</a>-<a href="1308.htm">1308</a>, <a href="1321.htm">1321</a>, <a href="1322.htm">1322</a>, <a href="1326.htm">1326</a>, <a href="1327.htm">1327</a> (end). This explains why Babylon 
is called 'a harlot' and 'the mother of whores'. People who know nothing about the internal sense will think that 'the kings of the earth who have committed whoredom with her' means kings on earth 
or kingdoms. Neither kings nor kingdoms are meant however, but the Church's truths of faith; and 'to commit whoredom' with these is to pervert them. For the meaning of 'kings' as the truths of faith,

from the perversion of truth; and 'the earth', as shown just above, is the Church She is said 'to be seated on many waters' because she rests on falsities; for 'waters' in the genuine sense are truths, 
and in the contrary sense falsities, <a href="729.htm">729</a>, <a href="790.htm">790</a>, <a href="8137.htm">8137</a>, <a href="8138.htm">8138</a>, <a href="8568.htm">8568</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 The fact that 'committing adultery' and 'committing whoredom' mean perverting the Church's forms of good and its truths is also 
quite clear from the following words elsewhere in Ezekiel, </p>
<p>Two women, the daughters of one mother, committed whoredom in Egypt. In their youth they committed whoredom. Oholah is Samaria, and Oholibah 
is Jerusalem. Oholah committed whoredom under Me and doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians her neighbours - clothed in purple, governors and leaders, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding 
on horses. She bestowed her acts of whoredom on them, the choicest of all the sons of Asshur. But her acts of whoredom brought from Egypt she did not give up, for they kind lab' with her in her 
youth. Oholibah corrupted her love more than she, and her acts of whoredom more than her sister 's acts of whoredom; she desired the sons of Asshur. She added to her acts of whoredom, when she saw men 
portrayed on the wall, images of the Chaldeans, painted in vermilion. As soon as her eyes saw them she desired them. The sons of Babel came also to her, into her love-bed; they defiled her through their 
whoredom. Yet she multiplied her acts of whoredom when she remembered the days of her youth, in which she committed whoredom in the land of Egypt. She desired them more than their concubines did. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2023:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 23:1</a>ff. </p>
<p>Here also no one can fail to see that 'acts of whoredom' is used to mean spiritual acts of whoredom, that is, perversions of the good and falsifications of the truth which the Church 
possesses, and also that what the internal sense contains does not become evident unless one knows what is meant by 'the sons of Egypt', 'the Assyrians' or 'sons of Asshur', 'Chaldea', and 'Babel'. Those 
nations are plainly not the meaning but such things as belong to falsity; for the inhabitants of Samaria and Jerusalem did not literally commit whoredom with them. But what 'Egypt', 'Asshur', 'Chaldea', 
and 'Babel' mean has been shown and may be seen just above. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 From the following passages also it is clear that 'whoredoms' and 'adulteries' in the internal sense are falsifications and perversions 
of goodness and truth, thus adulterations of them, as in Hosea, </p>
<blockquote>
Contend with your mother, contend, since she is not My wife, and I am not her husband, in order that she may remove her whoredoms 
from her sight,<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> and her adulteries from between her breasts. I will not have mercy on her children, for they are children of whoredoms, because their mother committed whoredom saying, I will 
go after my lovers giving [me] my bread, and my water, and my wool, and my flax, my oil, and my drink. But I will lay waste her vine and her fig tree, about which she has said, These are my harlot's reward 
that my lovers have given me. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hosea%202:2-12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hosea 2:2-12</a>

 All this now shows fully what 'committing adultery' means - that in the external sense it means committing acts of adultery; in the 
internal representative sense it means worshipping idols and other gods by means of the kinds of things the Church possesses, consequently acts outwardly and inwardly idolatrous; but in the internal 
spiritual sense it means adulterations of good and perversions of truth. All this shows plainly why it is that adulterous actions are intrinsically disgusting and called abominations; that is to say, 
they are such because they correspond to the marriage of evil and falsity, which is the hellish marriage. It also shows conversely why genuine marriages are holy - that they are such because they correspond 
to the marriage of goodness and truth, which is the heavenly marriage. Indeed genuine conjugial love descends from the marriage of goodness and truth, and so from heaven, that is, from the Lord 
by way of heaven. But adulterous love springs from the marriage of falsity and evil, and so from hell, that is, from the devil.

`Non adulterabis': quod significet quod illa quae doctrinae fidei et charitatis sunt non pervertenda, ita non Verbum applicandum ad confirmanda falsa et mala, tum quod non leges ordinis invertendae, 
constat ex significatione `adulterare,' `moechari,' et `scortari,' {1} quod in sensu spirituali seu interno sint {2} pervertere bona et falsificare vera quae doctrinae fidei et charitatis sunt; et quia 
haec per `adulterare' significantur, etiam significatur applicare Verbum ad confirmanda mala et falsa, nam Verbum est ipsissima doctrina fidei et charitatis, et perversio veri (o)et boni ibi, est applicatio 
ad falsa et mala; quod haec significentur per `adulterare' et `moechari' in sensu spirituali vix aliquis hodie scit, ex causa quia hodie intra Ecclesiam a paucis scitur quid spirituale et qualiter 
hoc differt a naturali, et vix ab aliquo, quod correspondentia sit inter utrumque, et quidem talis ut sistatur imago unius in altero, hoc est, repraesentetur spirituale in naturali; consequenter 
quod spirituale sit sicut anima et naturale sicut ejus corpus, et sic per influxum et inde conjunctionem constituant unum, sicut {3} in homine regenerato internus ejus homo qui etiam spiritualis vocatur, 
et externus qui etiam dicitur naturalis. 	[2] Quia talia hodie ignorantur, idcirco non sciri potest quid `adulterare' {4} ulterius significat, quam quoad corpus illegitime conjungi.  Quia illa, 
ut dictum est, hodie ignorantur, licet causam {5} dicere cur `adulterare' in sensu spirituali significat {6} pervertere illa quae doctrinae fidei et charitatis sunt, ita adulterare bona et falsificare 
vera; causa est, quae {7} arcana hodie, quod amor conjugialis descendat ex conjugio boni et veri, quod conjugium caeleste vocatur; amor qui a Domino influit, qui est inter bonum et verum in caelo, vertitur 
in amorem conjugialem in terra, et hoc per correspondentiam; inde est quod falsificatio veri sit `scortatio' et perversio boni sit `adulteratio' in sensu interno; inde quoque est quod qui in bono 
et vero fidei non sunt nec in genuino amore (x)conjugiali possint esse, tum quod qui in adulteriis capiunt jucundum vitae non amplius aliquid fidei possint recipere; dictum audivi ab angelis quod 
ut primum aliquis adulterium committit in terra, et in eo capit jucundum, claudatur ei caelum, hoc est, is renuat amplius recipere inde aliquid fidei et charitatis; quod hodie in regnis ubi Ecclesia a 
perplurimis adulteria pro nihilo reputentur, est quia Ecclesia est in fine suo {8}, et sic non amplius aliqua fides, quia non charitas; unum enim correspondet alteri; ubi nulla fides est falsum loco 
veri et malum loco boni, et inde fluit quod adulteria non magis ut crimina reputentur {9}; nam clauso caelo (o)apud hominem talia ab inferno influunt; (m)videantur quae de his prius dicta et ostensa sunt, 
n. 2727-2759, 4434, (x)4835, 4837.(n) 	[3] Quod `moechari' et `adulterari' {10} in sensu interno seu spirituali sit falsificare et pervertere vera et bona fidei et charitatis, proinde etiam {11} 
confirmare falsum et malum per pravas applicationes e Verbo, constare potest a singulis locis in Verbo ubi `adulterari,' `moechari,' et `scortari' nominantur {12}, quod manifeste patebit a sequentibus, 
ut apud Ezechielem, 	Fili hominis, notifica Hierosolymae abominationes ejus: Scortata es propter nomen tuum, et effudisti scortationes tuas super omnem transeuntem; sumpsisti de vestibus tuis, et 
fecisti tibi excelsa variegata, et scortata es super illis; accepisti vasa ornatus tui ex auro Meo et ex argento Meo quod dederam tibi, et feceras tibi imagines masculi; scortata es cum (c)illis: sumpsisti 
filios tuos et filias tuas, quas peperisti Mihi, et sacrificasti [illos eis].  Num parum de scortationibus tuis?(n) Scortata es cum filiis Aegypti, vicinis tuis, magnis carne, et multiplicasti scortationem 
tuam ad irritandum Me: et scortata es cum filiis Aschuris, cum satietas tibi nulla, cum quibus etiam scortata es, et tamen non saturata; et multiplicasti scortationem tuam usque ad terram 
negotiationis Chaldaeam, et tamen in hoc non satiata es.  Mulier adultera sub viro suo accipit alienos; omnibus meretricibus dant mercedem, tu vero (x)dedisti mercedes tuas omnibus amasiis tuis, et remunerasti 
eos, ut venirent ad te e circuitu in scortationibus tuis: propterea, meretrix, audi verbum Jehovae, Judicabo te judiciis adulterarum, et effundentium sanguinem, xvi 1 seqq.; </p>
<p>[4] quis non videre 
potest quod per `scortationes' hic significentur falsificationes {13} veri ac adulterationes boni? et quis potest intelligere hic verbulum nisi sciat quod `scortatio' talia significet, tum nisi sciat 
quid `filii Aegypti,' `filii Aschuris,' `Chaldaea,' cum quibus (x)Hierosolyma dicitur scortata? quod non cum illis ipsis (o)populis scortata sit, patet; dicendum itaque quid in sensu interno illa 
significant; per (x)Hierosolymam intelligitur Ecclesia perversa; `vestes' ibi sunt vera quae pervertuntur, inde falsa quae agnoscuntur sunt `excelsa variegata'; `filii Aegypti' sunt scientifica, `filii 
Aschuris' ratiocinia, `Chaldaea' profanatio veri; quod `vestes' sint vera, videatur n. 1073, 2576, 4545, 4763, 5248, 5319, 5254, 6914, (x)6918; quod `excelsa' sint cultus, `excelsa variegata' hic cultus 
falsi, n. 796; `vasa ornatus ex auro et argento' sunt {14} cognitiones boni et veri, quod `vasa' sint cognitiones, n. 3068, 3079, quod `aurum' sit bonum, n. 113, 1551, 1552, 5658, 6914, 6917, `argentum' 
verum boni, n. 1551, (x)2048, 2954, 5658; `imagines masculi'  (x)significant apparentias et similitudines veri {15}, n. 2046; `filii et filiae quas pepererunt' sunt {14} vera et bona quae perverterunt, 
quod `filii' sint vera, n. 489, 491, 533, 1147, 2623, 2803, 2813, 3373, quod {16} `filiae' bona, n. (x)489, 2362, 3024; quod `filii Aegypti' sint scientifica per quae perversio, n. 1164, 1165, 
1186, 1462, 2588 fin., 4749, 4964, (x)4967, 5700, 5702, 6004, 6015, 6125, 6651, 6679, 6683, 6692, 6750, 7296, 7779, 7926; `Aschur' quod sit ratiocinatio, per quam mediis scientificis vera fidei perversa, 
et bona ejus adulterata sunt, n.  119, (x)1186; `multiplicare scortationem usque ad terram Chaldaeam' est {17} usque ad profanationem veri, quod `Chaldaea' sit profanatio veri, n. 1368; inde patet 
cur dicitur {18} `mulier adultera,' tum `meretrix'; [5] similiter ac de `Babylone' in Apocalypsi, 	Venit unus ex septem angelis habentibus septem phialas, et locutus est mecum dicens mihi, Veni, 
monstrabo tibi Judicium meretricis magnae sedentis super aquis multis, cum qua scortati sunt reges terrae, et inebriati sunt [ex] vino scortationis ejus in habitantes  terram: erat Babylon magna mater 
scortorum, et abominationum terrae, xvii 1, 2, 5, xiv 8, xviii 3; </p>
<p>quod `Babylon' sint qui pervertunt vera et bona Ecclesiae sui dominii et sui quaestus causa, et hoc usque ad profanationem, constat 
ex significatione `Babelis,' n. 1182, 1283, 1295, 1304, 1306-1308, 1321, 1322, 1326, 1327 fin.; inde est quod Babylon dicatur `meretrix' et `mater scortorum'; qui de sensu interno nihil sciunt credent 
quod `reges terrae qui cum illa scortati sunt' significent reges in terra aut regna, sed non significant reges nec regna, sed vera fidei Ecclesiae, cum quibus scortari est illa pervertere; quod `reges' 
sint vera fidei, videatur n. 1672, 2015, 2069, 3009, 4575, 4581, 4966, (x)5044, 6148, et quod `terra' sit Ecclesia, n. 566, 662, 1067, 1262, 1413, 1607, 1733, 1850, 2117, 2118 fin., 2928, (x)3355, 
4447, 4535, 5577, 8011, 8732; (o)inebriati vino scortationis inhabitantes terram' est quod in errores et deliria redacti sint per falsa ex malo illi qui intra Ecclesiam sunt, `inebriari' enim est in 
errores per falsa ratiocinia et per pravas interpretationes Verbi duci, n. 1072; `vinum' est falsum ex malo, n. 6377, inde `vinum scortationis' est falsum ex perversione veri; quod `terra' sit Ecclesia, 
modo ostensum est; (m)`edere' dicitur `super aquis multis' quia super falsis, nam `aquae' in sensu genuino sunt vera, et in (o)sensu opposito falsa, n. 729, 790, 8137, 8138, 8568.(n) 	[6] {19}Quod 
`(x)adulterare et scortari' sit pervertere bona et vera (o)Ecclesiae, constat manifeste etiam alibi [ex his] apud Ezechielem, 	Duae mulieres, filiae unius matris, scortatae sunt in Aegypto, in adolescentia 
sua scortatae sunt, Ohola Samaria, et Oholiba Hierosolyma; scortata est Ohola sub Me, et dilexit amasios suos, Assyrios propinquos, vestitos hyacintho, praefectos et duces, juvenes desiderii omnes, 
equites equitantes equis; dedit scortationes (o)suas super illos, delectum filiorum Aschuris omnium: attamen scortationes suas ex Aegypto non deseruit, nam cum illis concubuerant {20} in adolescentia 
sua: Oholiba corrupit amorem suum prae illa, et scortationes suas supra {21} scortationes sororis suae; filios Aschuris adamavit; addidit ad scortationes [suas], cum vidit viros pictos super pariete, 
imagines Chaldaeorum, pictos minio, et amavit eos ad aspectum oculorum suorum; venerunt etiam ad illam filii Babelis ad concubitum amorum; (m)polluerunt illam per scortationem suam; multiplicavit 
tamen scortationes suas dum recordata est dierum adolescentiae, quibus scortata est in terra Aegypti; adamavit supra paelices illos,(n) xxiii [1] seqq.; </p>
<p>in his etiam nullus non videre potest quod per 
`scortationes' {22} intelligantur scortationes (x)spirituales, hoc est, perversiones boni et falsificationes veri, (o)quae Ecclesiae; tum {23} quod contenta in sensu interno non (x)patescant nisi sciatur 
quod significatur per `filios Aegypti,' per `Assyrios' seu `filios Aschuris,' per `Chaldaeam,' et (o)per `Babelem,' nam quod illae gentes non intelligantur sed quod talia quae sunt falsi, liquet, 
cum illis enim non scortati sunt incolae Samariae et Hierosolymae; sed quid per Aegyptum, Aschurem, Chaldaeam et Babelem significatur, mox supra ostensum videatur. 	[7] Ex sequentibus etiam constat 
quod `scortationes' et `adulteria' {24} in sensu interno sint (o)falsificationes et perversiones boni et veri, (o)ita adulterationes horum, ut apud Hoscheam, 	Contendite cum matre vestra, contendite, 
quoniam illa non uxor Mea, et Ego non maritus ejus, ut removeat scortationes a faciebus suis, et adulteria sua ab inter ubera sua; filiorum ejus non miserebor, quia filii scortationum illi, quoniam 
scortata est mater illorum, dicens, Ibo post amasios meos, dantes panem meum, et aquas meas, lanam meam, et linum meum, oleum meum, et potus meos: sed devastabo vitem ejus et ficum ejus, de quibus dixit, 
Merces meretricia illa mihi, quam dederunt mihi amasii mei, ii 2-12; </p>
<p>per `matrem' in sensu interno hic intelligitur Ecclesia, n. 289, 2691, 2717, 4257, (x)5581, 8897, pariter per `uxorem,' n. 252, 
253, 409, 749, 770, quae `non uxor' dicitur, quia in veris perversis, hoc est, falsis; per `filios' vera Ecclesiae, hic falsa, quia dicuntur `filii scortationum,' n. 489, 491, 533, 2623, 2803, 2813, 
(x)3373, 3704, 4257; quid `panis,' quid `aqua,' quid `lana' et `linum,' tum `oleum' et `potus,' ut et {25} `vitis' et `ficus,' ostensum est in suis locis, quod nempe sint bona amoris et charitatis, 
tum bona et vera fidei interiora et exteriora, at {26} mala et falsa in sensu opposito, nam bona fiunt mala et vera fiunt falsa cum pervertuntur; quid `panis' videatur n. 276, 680, 2165, 2177, 3464, 3478, 
3735, 3813, 4217, 4735, 4976, 5915, 6118, (x)8410, quid `aquae,' n. (x)739, 790, 8137, 8138, 8568, quid `linum,' n. 7601, quid `oleum,' n. 886, 3728, 4582, quid `potus,' n. 3069, 3168, 3772, 8562, 
quid `vitis,' n. 1069, 5113, 6376, {27} quid `ficus,' n. (x)4231, 5113; `merces meretricia' est falsum doctrinae quod venditant pro vero: [8] apud eundem, 	{28} Populus Meus lignum interrogat, et 
baculus ejus respondet illi, quia spiritus scortationis seduxit, et scortati sunt a sub deo suo; super verticibus montium sacrificant, et super collibus suffiunt, propterea scortantur filiae vestrae, 
et nurus vestrae adulterantur: (m)nonne {29} visitavero super filias vestras, quia scortantur, et super nurus vestras quia adulterantur, quia hi {30} cum scortis dividunt, et cum prostibulis sacrificant? 
(n) si scortaris tu, Israel, ne reus fiat Jehudah, iv 11 seqq.; </p>
<p>{31} `scortari sub deo suo' pro pervertere verum {32}, nam per `deum' in sensu interno significatur verum et in opposito falsum, n. 
2586, 2769, 2807, 2822, 4295, 4402, 4544, 7010, 7268, 7873, 8301, 8867, `montes et colles' sunt amores, hic (o)amores sui et mundi, n. 795, 796, (x)1691, 2722, 6435, `lignum quod interrogatur' est bonum 
jucundi alicujus cupiditatis, n. 643, `baculus qui respondet' est potentia imaginaria ex proprio intellectuali, n. 4013, 4015, 4876, 4936, 7011, (x)7026; (m)quia `dii' significans in genuino sensu 
vera et in opposito falsa, ideo falsificare vera et adulterare bona significatur {33} per scortati post deos alienos, ut post (x)baalem, post Molechum, post idola, Lev. xx 5; Ezech. vi 9; {34} et alibi.(n) 	[9] 
Ex his nunc constare potest quid per `adulteria et scortationes' intelligitur in sequentibus his locis: apud Esaiam, 	Vos accedite huc, filii praestigiatricis, semen adulteri, et scortata 
est; contra quem oblectatis vos? contra quem dilatatis os, et elongatis linguam? nonne vos nati praevaricationis, semen mendacii, qui incaluistis in dii sub omni arbore viridi? lvii 3-5: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Fiet 
in fine septuaginta annorum visitabit Jehovah Tyrum, ut redeat ad mercedem meretriciam suam, et scortetur cum omnibus regnis terrae super faciebus orbis, xxiii 17, 18: </p>
<p>apud Jeremiam, 	Et dimisit 
vir uxorem suam, et abivit ab eo, et fuit viro alii; scortata est cum sociis multis; profanasti terram scortationibus tuis et malitia tua: nam vidisti quae fecit aversa Israel, abiens haec super 
omnem montem altum, et sub omnem arborem viridem, et scortabaris ibi? etiam perfida Jehudah soror ejus, abivit et scortata est etiam illa; (x)adeo ut a voce scortationis ejus profanaverit terram, moechata 
est cum lapide et ligno, (x)iii 1-10 apud eundem, 	Haec sors tua, quod oblita es Mei, et confisa es mendacio; adulteria tua, et hinnitus tui, scelus (x)scortationis tuae, super collibus in agro 
vidi abominationes tuas; vae tibi, Hierosolyma! xiii 25, 27: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Contra prophetas: adulteris plena est terra, quia propter maledictionem luget terra, exaruerunt pascua deserti; quia tam 
propheta quam sacerdos hypocrisin exercent: in prophetis Hierosolymae etiam vidi obfirmationem horrendam, adulterando et eundo in mendacio; confirmarunt manus malorum; visionem cordis sui loquuntur non 
ex ore Jehovae, xxiii 9, 10 seq.: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Fecerunt stultitiam in Israele, et moechati sunt cum uxoribus sociorum suorum, et locuti sunt verbum in nomine Meo mendaciter, quod non praecepi illis, 
xxix 23; </p>
<p>[10] ex his manifeste patet quod (x)`adulterare' et `moechari' sit ex suo corde, hoc est, ex proprio, ita sicut suadent amores sui et mundi, explicare et pervertere Verbi vera; (m)proinde 
loqui {35} mendacia, hoc est, falsa, sicut aperte dicitur {36}.(n)  Insuper apud Hoscheam, 	Ne laeteris, Israel, quia scortatus es de sub Deo tuo; dilexisti mercedem meretriciam super omnibus areis 
frumenti, ix 1: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Locutus est Jehovah ad Hoscheam, Abi, accipe tibi mulierem scortationum, et liberos scortationum, quia scortando scortatur terra a post Jehovam, i 2: </p>
<p>apud Nahum, 	Vae 
urbi sanguinum! prae multitudine scortationum scorti, boni gratia, magistrae praestigiarum, (x)vendentis gentes per scortationes suas, et familias per praestigias suas iii [1,] 4: </p>
<p>apud Moschen, 	Filii 
vestri erunt pascentes in deserto 40 annis, et portabunt scortationes vestras, juxta numerum dierum quibus explorastis terram, dies singuli pro anno, portabitis iniquitates vestras 40 annis {37}, 
Num. xiv (x)33, 34. 	[11] Quia scortationibus in terra correspondebant falsificationes veri et adulterationes boni, ideo poena mortis erat adulteris, Lev. xx 10, et filia viri sacerdotis, si profanaverit 
se scortando, igne combureretur {38}, Lev. xxi 9, tum {39} quod non aliqua filia in Israele exponeretur scortationi, Lev. xix 29 (n)pariter {40} quod non veniret spurius in congregationem Jehovae, 
ne quidem generatio ejus decima, Deut. xxiii 3 [A. V. 2], (o)et quod non inferenda esset merces meretricia {41} in domum Jehovae, quia abominatio, Deut. xxiii (x)18, 19.(n) 	[12] Ex his nunc (o)plene 
constare potest quid per (x)`adulterare' significatur, (s)quod nempe in sensu externo (o)sit committere adulteria, in sensu interno repraesentativo colere idola et alios deos per talia quae Ecclesiae 
sunt, consequenter (x)idololatrica externa et interna {42}; in sensu autem interno spirituali significantur adulterationes boni et perversiones veri; ex his evidenter patet unde est quod adulteria 
in se tam nefanda sint, ac dicantur abominationes, {43} quod nempe inde,(s) omnes quia correspondent conjugio falsi et mali, quod est conjugium infernale; et vice versa, cur conjugia genuina sancta 
sunt {44}, quod nempe inde, quia correspondent conjugio boni et veri, quod est conjugium caeleste; immo amor conjugialis {45} genuinus ex conjugio boni et veri descendit, ita e caelo, hoc est, per caelum
