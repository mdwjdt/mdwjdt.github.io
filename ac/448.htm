<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第448节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>448.</strong>我与很多在世相识的人交谈过，这样的对话持续了很长时间，可以说经年累月，尽管是内在的声音，但它清晰可闻，如同在人世与朋友交谈一样。谈话的主题有时涉及人死后的状况，他们感到非常惊讶的是，在肉身生活期间，竟然没人知道或相信肉体生命结束后，人会象现在这样活着。然而的确存在一个生活的延续，这种延续就是人从朦胧的生活过渡到清明的生活，那些信主的人会进入愈加明朗的生活中。他们盼望我转告其亲友，他们还活着，并且还想要我写信告知他们的情况，就象我将他们亲友的近况报告给他们那样。不过，我答复他们说，就算我真的将这些事告知他们的亲友，或写信给他们，他们也不相信，反而会称其为幻觉，加以嘲笑，甚至要求在他们相信前先显个神迹，因此我必受尽他们的嘲弄。几乎没人会相信我的话是真的，因为世人从内心否认灵的存在，即便不否认的人，也不愿听说人能与灵对话。古时，人们从不怀疑灵的存在，但如今世人却通过离奇古怪的推理试图探究什么是灵，通过他们的定义和假设剥夺灵的所有感觉，人们越是这么做，似乎显得越有学问。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]448.</strong> I have talked to many people I knew in their bodily life, and our conversations have continued a long time, over months and through a year. Our voices were as clear to each other as voices are among friends in this world, but they were heard internally. Sometimes we also engaged in discussions about the human condition after death. They were astounded that no one who is alive in the body knows or believes that she or he will live on after physical life ends, when the truth is that life continues, and continues in such a way that it passes from darkness into broad daylight. For those who believe in the Lord, life grows clearer and clearer.<br />These people wanted me to tell their friends [on earth] that they were alive and to send letters describing their current status. They themselves had heard much from me about how those friends were doing.<br />[2] "But," I said, "if I were to say or write the things you ask, your friends would not believe me. They would accuse me of hallucinating, laugh at me, and demand signs or miracles before believing. So I would be exposed to their ridicule. Few, perhaps, would believe that those things were true, because they deny at heart that spirits exist. Even those who do not deny are completely unwilling to hear that anyone could talk with spirits."<br />Such beliefs about spirits never existed in ancient times, only in modern times, when people desire to investigate what the spirit is in a highly intellectual way that relies on skewed logic. With their definitions and theories they deprive spirits of all sensation, and the more erudite they claim to be, the more they do so. </p>

I have conversed with many who had been known to me in this life (and this I have done for a long time-for months and years), in as clear a voice, although an inward one, as with friends in this world. 
The subject of our conversation has sometimes been the state of man after death, and they have wondered exceedingly that during the bodily life no one knows or believes that he is so to live when the 
bodily life is over, when yet there is then a continuation of life, and such a continuation that the man passes from an obscure life into a clear one, and those who are in faith in the Lord into a 
life that is more and more clear. They have desired me to tell their friends that they are alive, and to write and tell them what their condition is, even as I had related to themselves many things about 
that of their friends here. But I replied that were I to tell their friends such things, or to write to them about them, they would not believe, but would call them delusions, would scoff at them, 
and would ask for signs or miracles before they would believe; and I should merely expose myself to their derision. And that these things are true, perchance but few will believe. For at heart men deny 
the existence of spirits, and even those who do not deny it are unwilling to hear that anyone can speak with spirits. In ancient times there was no such state of belief in regard to spirits, but so 
it is now when by crazy ratiocination men try to find out what spirits are, and by their definitions and suppositions deprive them of all the senses, and do this the more, the more learned they desire to be. </p>

I have spoken to many people whom I had known during their lifetime, and have done so for considerable lengths of time, for months or a year. I have spoken in as clear a voice, though an internal one, 
as when speaking to friends in the world. Conversation with them has included the subject of man's condition after death. They have been utterly amazed that nobody in the life of the body knows or believes 
that when his bodily life ends he will be alive even as they are now. Yet there is a continuation of life such as involves passing from an obscure life into a clear life, and with people who have 
had faith in the Lord, passing into life that is more and more clear. They wished me to tell their friends that they were alive, and to write to them telling of their condition, just as I had reported 
to them also many things about the state of their friends. I said however that if I did speak or write to their friends these would not believe me. They would call it sheer imagination, they would 
laugh me to scorn, they would ask for signs or miracles before believing, and so I would expose myself to their derision. Few would probably have would expose believed that what I said was true, for 
in their hearts they deny that spirits exist; and those who do not deny their existence nevertheless refuse to hear of anybody being able to talk to spirits. In ancient times such disbelief concerning 
spirits never existed, but nowadays they wish to discover what spirits may be by a crack-brained reasoning involving definitions and presuppositions that deprives spirits of every one of the senses. 
And the more learned that people wish to be, the more they continue in this way. </p>

</p><b>448.</b>
Locutus cum multis qui in vita eorum corporis mihi noti fuerunt, et diu, per menses et annum, tam clara voce, sed interna, sicut cum amicis in mundo; cum quibus aliqua etiam intercesserunt commercia 
sermonis de statu hominis post mortem; mirati valde quod nemo in corporis vita sciat vel credat quod victurus ita post vitam corporis, cum tamen sit continuatio vitae, et talis ut transeat e vita obscura 
in perspicuam; et qui in fide in Dominum, in magis magisque perspicuam: voluerunt ut dicerem amicis eorum quod vivant, et quod scriberem ad eos; qui eorum status sint, quibus etiam plura narravi 
de statu amicorum eorum; [2] sed dixi, si dicerem aut scriberem, quod non crederent;  vocarent phantasias, irriderent, peterent signa aut miracula antequam credant, sic exponerer eorum subsannationi: 
et quod haec vera sint, forte pauci credituri, nam negant corde quod sint spiritus; et qui non negant, usque nihil audire volunt quod aliquis cum spiritibus loqui possit. Talis fides de spiritibus nusquam 
fuit antiquis temporibus, sed hodie, cum ex cerebroso ratiocinio volunt explorare quid spiritus, quos omni sensu privant per definitiones et suppositiones; et quo eruditiores volunt esse, eo plus. </p>
