<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1680节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1680.</strong>“以及住在哈洗逊他玛的亚摩利人”表源于这些虚假的各种恶欲。这从刚才所述以及下一章（16节）论述的“亚摩利人”的含义清楚可知。至于主与之争战的邪恶与虚假，要知道，他们是被恶与假所主导的地狱灵，也就是说，他们是充满这类事物的地狱，这些地狱不断骚扰人类。地狱里的人只渴望毁灭每个人，再没有比折磨他人更令他们快乐的了。<br />在来世，所有灵人按以下方式被区分：那些向他人意愿邪恶的人都是地狱灵或魔鬼灵，而那些向他人意愿良善的人都是善灵和天使灵。人用以下方法就能知道他在哪类人之列，是在地狱灵之列，还是在天使灵之列：若他对自己的邻舍意图邪恶，只对他思想邪恶，并且一有机会就行出来，还以之为乐，那他就在地狱灵之列，而且在来世也会变成地狱灵。然而，人若对自己的邻舍意图良善，只对他思想良善，并且一有机会就行出来，则在天使灵之列，在来世也会变成一名天使。这就是灵人彼此区分的方式。所以，每个人都要以此检查自己，以获知自己是哪类人。<br />人若因不能或不敢而不去作恶，在目的上等于什么也没做，人若为了自我的缘故而行善，也等于什么也没做。因为这些都是在来世被除去的外在因素。在来世，人的思维和意图决定了他是哪类人。有很多灵人出于在世时所形成的习惯而言语得体，但在来世立刻就能发觉他们的心智或意图是否与他们所说的相一致。若不一致，他们就被丢进属于他们自己的属和种的地狱灵中。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1680.</strong> And also the Amorite living in Hazazon-tamar symbolizes general categories of the resulting evil. This can be seen from the remarks just above and from the representation and symbolism of Amorites, which are mentioned below in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1680/bible_king-james-version_genesis_15_16" target=_top>Genesis 15:16</a> [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1680/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1857" target=_top>1857</a>].<br />In regard to the evil and falsity that the Lord fought, it needs to be known that they consisted of hellish spirits devoted to evil and falsity. In other words, they consisted of hells filled with evil and falsity, which were constantly plaguing the human race. Hellish spirits want nothing less than to destroy everyone, and nothing thrills them more than causing pain.<br />[2] In the other world, all spirits are divided up in this way: Those who wish evil on others are hellish or diabolical spirits, but those who wish well to others are good or angelic spirits. We can tell which group we are associating with, hellish or angelic. If we intend harm to our neighbors, think only evil thoughts about them, actually hurt them when we can, and enjoy doing so, we are associating with hellish spirits and become hellish spirits ourselves in the other life. If we have good intentions toward our neighbors, though, think only good thoughts about them, and actually do them good when we can, we are associating with angelic spirits and become angels ourselves in the other life. This is the sign. Examine yourself by this standard, if you want to know what you are like.<br />[3] To refrain from doing evil when one cannot or does not dare is worth nothing. It is also worthless to do good for selfish reasons. These are superficial efforts that we lay aside in the next world. In that world, we are what we think and what we intend. There are many who know how to speak well, from a lifetime of practice, but others sense immediately whether their mind or heart is in it. If not, they are sent away to join hellish spirits of their own kind. </p>

And also the Amorite that dwelt in Hazezon-tamar. That this signifies the kinds of evils derived from those falsities, is evident from what has just been said, and also from the representation and signification 
of the Amorites, spoken of in the next chapter, verse 16. As regards the evils and falsities against which the Lord combated, it is to be known that what He fought against was the infernal 
spirits who were in the evils and falsities, that is, it was the hells filled with such spirits, which continually infested the human race. The infernals desire nothing else than to destroy everyone; 
and they perceive no greater pleasure than in torturing others.  [2] All spirits in the other life are distinguished in the following manner: those who desire evil against others are infernal or diabolical 
spirits; but those who desire good to others are good and angelic spirits. A man can know among which he is, whether among the infernal or among the angelic: if he intends evil to his neighbor, 
thinks nothing but evil concerning him, and actually does it when he can, and takes delight therein, he is among the infernals, and also becomes infernal in the other life; whereas the man who intends 
good to his neighbor, and thinks nothing but good respecting him, and actually does it when he can, is among the angelic spirits, and also becomes an angel in the other life. This is the distinctive 
characteristic. Let everyone examine himself by this, in order to learn what he is.  [3] That a man does no evil when he is unable or afraid to do it, amounts to nothing; or that he does good for the 
sake of self; for these are external things that are removed in the other life. A man there is such as he thinks and intends. There are many who can speak well from a habit formed in the world; but 
it is instantly perceived whether the mind or intention agrees therewith; if not, they are rejected among the infernals of their own genus and species. </p>

'And also the Amorites inhabiting Hazezon-tamar' means kinds of evils derived from this. This is clear from what has just been stated and also from the representation and meaning of 'the Amorites', dealt 
with at verse 16 of the next chapter. As for the evils and falsities against which the Lord fought, it should be recognized that they were spirits from hell who were ruled by evils and falsities, 
that is, they were hells that were full of such things, hells which were infesting the human race constantly. Those in hell have but one desire, to destroy everyone; and they find nothing more pleasurable 
than inflicting torture on others. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 All spirits in the next life are distinguished as follows: Those who wish evil on others are hellish or devilish spirits, whereas those who will good to 
others are good and angelic spirits. A person may know whom he is among, whether among those from hell or those who are angelic, from this: If he intends evil to his neighbour, thinks nothing but evil 
regarding him, and when possible actually does it, and takes delight in this, he is among spirits from hell and also becomes one himself in the next life. The person however who intends good to his 
neighbour, thinks nothing but good regarding him, and when possible actually does it, is among angelic spirits, and also becomes an angel in the next life. This is how one spirit is to be distinguished 
from another; so let the individual examine himself in this way to discover what he himself is really like. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Refraining from evil when one is unable to do it or when one dare not do it amounts 
in the end to nothing; and doing good for selfish reasons also amounts to nothing. These are external considerations that are taken away in the next life. There it is a person's thought and intention 
that determine what he is There are many spirits who because they were accustomed to do so in the world are able to speak virtuously, but it is discerned in an instant whether their mind or intention 
is in agreement with what they say. If it is not, a person is cast away among spirits in hell who are of his own genus and species. </p>

'Et etiam Emoraeum habitantem in Hazezon-tamar quod significet genera malorum quae inde, constat ex illis quae num dicta sunt, tum a repraesentatione et significatione 'Emoraeorum de qua in cap. seq. 
xv ad vers. 16.  Quod mala et falsa attinet, contra quae Dominus pugnavit, sciendum quod fuerint infernales spiritus qui in malis et falsis, hoc est, quod fuerint inferna talibus impleta quae continue 
infestabant genus humanum; infernales non aliud cupiunt quam perdere unumquemque, nec plus voluptatis percipiunt quam dum cruciant: [2] distinguuntur in altera vita omnes spiritus ex eo qui malum cupiunt 
contra alios, sunt spiritus infernales seu diabolici; qui autem bonum aliis volunt, sunt spiritus boni et angelici; homo potest scire inter quos est, num inter infernales vel inter angelicos; si 
proximo intendit malum, de illo non nisi malum cogitat, et cum potest etiam actualiter facit, et in eo delectatur, is est inter infernale: et fit etiam infernalis in altera vita; at qui proximo intendit 
bonum, et de illo non nisi bonum cogitat, et cum potest actualiter facit, is es inter angelicos, et fit etiam angelus in altera vita; hoc characteristicon est, examinet quisque se secundum hoc qualis 
est: [3] nihil est quod non malum faciat cum non potest nec audet, et nihil est quod bonum faciat sui causa, haec sunt externa quae removentur in altera vita, homo est ibi sicut cogitat et intendit; 
sunt plures qui ex habitu in mundo bene loqui possunt, sed appercipitur ilico num mens seu intentio consentit; si non, rejicitur inter infernales sui generis et speciei. </p>
