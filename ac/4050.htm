<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4050节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4050.</strong>我从上方的天窗先是看到一张面孔，不过，它很快又缩回去了；就在这时，我又看到一颗小星星在左眼区域附近，之后又看见许多闪着白光的小红星星。后来，我看见一座没有屋顶的房子的墙，并且只在左边有；最后看见像星空那样的东西。由于看到这些事物的地方是恶人所在之处，所以我以为会有某些丑陋可怕的景象展现给我。但是，这墙很快就消失了，星空也消失了，然后有一口井出现了，从井里冒出亮白的云彩或蒸汽。似乎还有其它东西从这井里涌出来。<br />我便询问这些事物表示并代表什么，被告知，这代表脑中的垂体柄，星空所代表的脑本身就在垂体柄上面。我之后所看到的东西是容器，这容器由井来表示，就叫做垂体柄；而从中冒上来的云彩或蒸汽则是经过垂体柄并从中流出的淋巴。我还被告知，这种淋巴有两种：一种与生命物质混合，属有用淋巴之列；一种与浆液性物质混合，属排泄淋巴之列。<br />接着，我被指示属该区域者的性质，不过，是极坏的那种。我还看见他们四处奔走，专注于他们所看到的人，关心一切事，并把他们所听来的事讲给别人听。他们总是疑神疑鬼，烦躁不安，与在里面来回流动的淋巴极为相似。他们的推理就是他们所代表的那里的液体。不过，这些灵人属于中间类型的。<br />然而，与排泄淋巴有关者则是那些把属灵真理拖至世俗事物，并在那里玷污它们的灵人。例如，他们听到有关婚姻之爱的事后，就把它用到淫乱和通奸的行为上，从而把婚姻之爱的事拖到这些东西上。其它一切事也一样。这些灵人出现在前面，离右边有点距离。不过，属于良善那类的灵人则与刚才（<a href="4049.htm">4049</a>节）所描述的灵人差不多。</p>

A certain face was first seen by me above an azure window, but presently withdrew itself within. I then saw a little star near the region of the left eye, and afterward a number of ruddy little stars 
that sparkled with white. Afterwards I saw the walls of a house, but no roof, the walls being only on the left side; and lastly I saw as it were the starry heaven. As these things were seen in a place 
where there were evil ones, I supposed that some hideous sight would be presented to me, but the wall soon disappeared, together with the starry heaven, and then there appeared a well, out of which 
came forth as it were a bright white cloud or vapor; and something also seemed to be pumped up out of the well.  [2] I asked what these things signified and represented, and was told that it was a representation 
of the infundibulum in the brain, above which is the brain itself, which was signified by the starry heaven; and that what was next seen was that vessel, signified by the well and called 
the infundibulum; and that the cloud or vapor arising from it was the lymph that passes through and is piped out of it; and that this lymph is of two kinds, namely, that mixed with the animal spirits, 
which is among the useful lymphs; and that mixed with serosities, which is among the excremental lymphs. [3] I was next shown the quality of those who belong to this province, but only those of the 
viler sort, whom I also saw running about hither and thither, applying themselves to those whom they saw, paying attention to everything, and reporting to others what they heard; and being prone to suspicions, 
impatient and restless, in close resemblance to the lymph which is therein, and is borne hither and thither; their reasonings being the fluids there which they represent. But these are of the 
middle sort. [4] But those who have relation to the excremental lymphs are they who drag down spiritual truths to earthly things, and there defile them-as for example, those who when they hear anything 
about conjugial love apply it to whoredoms and adulteries, and thus drag down the things of conjugial love to these; and the same with everything else. These appeared in front at some distance to 
the right. But those who are of the good sort are similar to those described just above in n. 4049. </p>

A certain face was first of all visible to me above a skylight and then presently withdrew inside. At that point I saw a little star around the region of the left eye, after that many little stars that 
were ruddy and were glittering with white. Then I saw some walls without a roof, the walls being on the left side only, and lastly I saw what looked like a starry sky. And because these things were 
seen in a place where those present were evil, I supposed that something hideous would be displayed for me to see. But shortly the wall disappeared, and also the starry sky, and a well appeared from 
which a brilliant cloud or vapour emerged. Something else also seemed to be pumped out of the well. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 I asked what those things meant and represented, and was told that it was a representation of 
the infundibulum within the brain, above which was the brain itself, meant by the sky. And what I had seen after that was the vessel meant by the well and called the infundibulum, while the cloud or 
vapour which emerged from it was the lymph which passes through and is pumped out of it. I was also told that there were two kinds of this lymph - that which is mingled with the vital substances, which 
belongs among the useful lymphs, and that which is mingled with serous substances, which belongs among the excrementitious lymphs. </p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 I was shown after this the nature of those who belong to this 
province, though only those of the baser sort, whom I also saw running about this way and that, devoting themselves to those they saw, paying attention to everything, and reporting to others the things 
they heard. They were disposed to be suspicious, impatient, and restless, just like that lymph which is within and is carried to and fro. Their reasonings are the fluids there which they represent. 
But these belong to an intermediate sort. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 Those however who correlate with the excrementitious lymphs there are those spirits who bring spiritual truths down to earthly things and there defile 
them. For example, when they hear anything to do with conjugial love they apply it to acts of whoredom and adultery, and in so doing bring what belongs to conjugial love down to these. So in everything 
else. These spirits were visible in front, some way out on the right. But those who belong to the good sort are like those referred to just above in <a href="4049.htm">4049</a>. </p>

</p><b>4050.</b>
Facies quaedam supra fenestram caeruleam mihi primum apparuit, quae facies se mox recepit intus, tunc mihi visa stellula circa regionem oculi sinistri, dein stellulae plures rutilae, quae coruscabant 
albe; postea visi mihi sunt parietes sed non tectum, parietes modo a sinistro latere, demum quasi caelum stelliferum; et quia haec visa in loco ubi mali, putabam aliquid tetrum esse quod mihi 
objiceretur videndum; sed mox disparabatur paries et caelum, et apparuit puteus e quo sicut candidus nimbus {1}aut vapor prodiit; videbatur etiam tanquam aliquid exantlaretur ex puteo; </p>
<p>quaerebam quid 
illa significarent et repraesentarent; dicebatur quod repraesentatio esset infundibuli in cerebro, supra quod esset cerebrum quod significatur per caelum, et quod dein videbatur, esset illud vas 
quod significatur per puteum, et vocatur infundibulum, et quod nimbus seu vapor qui inde, esset lympha quae pertransit et inde exantlatur; et quod lympha illa duplicis generis esset, nempe quae mixta 
cum spiritibus animalibus, {2}quae inter lymphas utiles, et quae mixta cum serositatibus quae inter lymphas excrementitias: [3] ostensum mihi dein quales illi qui ad hanc provinciam pertinent, 
sed modo qui vilioris sortis essent; etiam quoque visi, discurrunt huc et illuc, applicant se illis quos vident, attendunt ad singula, ac quae audiunt, nuntiant aliis, ad suspiciones proclives, impatientes, 
irrequieti; ad imitationem illius lymphae quae inibi et fertur cis et retro; ratiocinia eo sunt fluida ibi quae repraesentant; [4] sed hi sunt mediae sortis; </p>
<p>at qui excrementitias lymphas 
ibi referunt, sunt qui spirituales veritates deducunt ad terrestria, et ibi conspurcant illas, sicut pro exemplo: qui cum audiunt aliquid de amore conjugiali, ad scortationes et adulteria applicant, 
et sic quae amoris conjugialis sunt, ad haec deducunt; ita in ceteris; hi antrorsum ad aliquam distantiam ad dextrum apparuerunt.  Qui autem bonae sortis sunt, similes sunt illis de quibus mox supra 
n. 4049. @1 seu$ @2 et quae mixta cum serositatibus, illa inter lymphas utiles est, haec inter excrementitias$ </p>
