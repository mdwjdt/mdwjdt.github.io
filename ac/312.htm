<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第312节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>312.</strong>洪水前的人，其生命状态在本节作了充分的描述：他们被“赶出伊甸园”，亦即与属天之善分离，主又“从东边到伊甸园安置了基路伯”。“从东边到伊甸园”只适用于他们，不适用于洪水后的人。对于洪水后的人，当说“从伊甸园到东边”。<br />类似地，“剑的火焰自行转动”若用于今日之人，则当作“带火焰的剑自行转动”，而且“生命树”之“生命”当为单数。<br />此外，还有很多无法解释的奥秘，只有天使才能领会（主给他们启示）。因为每个状态皆包含无尽的奥秘，人对此一无所知。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]312.</strong> The current verse thoroughly describes the condition of these pre-Flood people in saying, for instance, that they were thrown out — separated from heavenly goodness — and that guardian beings were made to live on the east of the Garden of Eden. It is owing to their character that the verse [literally] says they lived "from" the east "to" the Garden of Eden, in words that can apply only to them. These words cannot be said of the people who lived later; they have to be described as stretching from the Garden of Eden to the east. The verse also mentions "the flame of a sword turning itself;" for modern people it would have spoken of "a sword of flame." Nor would it have mentioned a "tree of lives" but a "tree of life." There is still more in the series that can never be explained but can only be understood by angels, to whom the Lord reveals the meaning. Each state holds in it an unlimited number of secrets, and not one of them is known to the human race. </p>

In this verse, the state of these antediluvians is fully described, in that they were "cast out" or separated from celestial good, and in that "cherubim were placed from the east toward the garden of 
Eden." This expression, "from the east toward the garden of Eden" is applicable only to them, and could not be used in relation to those who lived afterwards, of whom it would have been said, "from the 
garden of Eden toward the east." In like manner, had the words "the flame of a sword turning itself" been applied to the people of the present day, they would have been "the sword of a flame turning 
itself." Nor would it have been said the "tree of lives" but the "tree of life;" not to mention other things in the series that cannot possibly be explained, being understood only by the angels, to 
whom the Lord reveals them; for every state contains infinite arcana, not even one of which is known to men. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 312</b></p><p><b>312.</b>
This verse contains a complete description of the state of these people who came before the Flood.  (<a href="1.htm">1</a>) 'They were expelled', that is, separated from celestial good.  (<a href="2.htm">2</a>) 'Cherubim were made to dwell 
away from the east towards the garden of Eden. ' Those people being what they were, the wording is 'away from the east towards the garden', words that are applicable solely to them, and not to the 
people who lived at a later time. The wording as it stands in this verse cannot be used of the latter, but the reverse can, 'away from the garden of Eden towards the east'.  (<a href="3.htm">3</a>) This verse also speaks 
of 'the flame of a sword turning itself this way and that'. Had the reference been to modern man the phrase would have been 'the sword of a flame', and 'the tree of life 'would have been used instead 
of 'the tree of lives'. And there are further features to the train of thought here which cannot possibly be explained. They are understood solely by angels to whom the Lord reveals them. Each of these 
states involves countless arcana, not a single one of which is known to the human race.  </p>

</p><b>312.</b>
Status antediluvianorum horum prorsus descriptus est ii hoc versu, ut quod 'ejecti,' seu separati a bono caelesti; quod 'habitare facti ab oriente ad hortum Edenis cherubi'; qui quia tales, dicitur 
quod 'ab oriente ad hortum Edenis,' quae verba iis solum applicabilia sunt; de iis autem qui postea vixerunt, non haec dici possunt, sed quod 'ab horto Edenis ad orientem': tum quod dicatur 'flamma gladii 
vertentis se'; si de hodiernis dictum fuisset, 'gladius flammae'; nec 'arbor vitarum,' sed 'arbor vitae'; praeter alia in serie, quae nusquam explicari possunt; solum angelis quibus Dominus revelat, 
intellecta; nam unusquisque status indefinita arcana habet, quorum ne quidem unum notum est generi humano. </p>
