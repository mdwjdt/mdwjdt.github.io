<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8336节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8336.</strong>出埃及记15:20，21.亚伦的姐姐女先知米利暗，手里拿着鼓，众妇女也跟她出去拿鼓跳舞。米利暗回应她们，你们要向耶和华歌唱，因祂高举自己，将马和骑马的投在海中。<br />“亚伦的姐姐女先知米利暗，手里拿着鼓”表出于信之良善将荣耀归于主。“众妇女也跟她出去”表一切真理之良善。“拿鼓跳舞”表出于欢喜快乐的赞美。“米利暗回应她们”表一种回应。“你们要向耶和华歌唱”表荣耀唯独属于主。“因祂高举自己”表祂已经在祂的人性中显明祂的神性。“将马和骑马的投在海中”表仅仅由于祂的同在，信仰上的虚假和生活上的邪恶就把自己投入地狱。</p>

Verses 20, 21. And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand, and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances. And Miriam answered to them, Sing ye to 
Jehovah, because exalting He hath exalted; the horse and his rider hath He cast into the sea. "And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand," signifies glorification of the 
Lord from the good of faith; "and all the women went out after her," signifies all the goods of truth; "with timbrels and with dances," signifies celebration from joy and gladness; "and Miriam answered 
to them," signifies what is reciprocal; "Sing ye to Jehovah," signifies that to the Lord alone belongs glory, "because exalting He hath exalted," signifies that He has manifested His Divine in the 
Human; "the horse and his rider hath He cast into the sea," signifies from the fact that by reason of His mere presence falsities of faith and evils of life have cast themselves into hell. </p>

Verses 20,21 And Miriam the prophetess, Aaron's sister, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances. And Miriam responded to them, Sing to Jehovah, 
for He has highly exalted [Himself]; the horse and its rider He has thrown into the sea. </p>
<p>'And Miriam the prophetess, Aaron's sister, took a timbrel in her hand' means ascribing glory to the Lord from 
the good of faith. 'And all the women went out after her' means every good of truth. 'With timbrels and with dances' means praise from joy and gladness. 'And Miriam responded to them' means a reciprocation. 
'Sing to Jehovah' means that glory belongs to the Lord alone. 'For He has highly exalted [Himself]' means that He has displayed His Divinity within His Humanity. 'The horse and its rider He 
has thrown into the sea' means that as a result simply of His presence falsities in faith and evils in life cast themselves into hell. </p>

Vers. 20, 21.  Et sumpsit Mirjam prophetissa, soror Aharonis, tympanum in manu sua; et exiverunt omnes mulieres post illam in tympanis et [in] choreis.  Et respondit illis Mirjam, Cantate Jehovae, quia 
exaltando exaltavit; equum et equitem ejus projecit in mare.  `Et sumpsit Mirjam prophetissa, soror Aharonis, tympanum in manu sua' significat glorificationem Domini ex bono fidei: `et exiverunt omnes 
mulieres post illam' significat omnia bona veri: `in tympanis et in choreis' significat celebrationem ex gaudio et laetitia: `{1} et respondit illis Mirjam' significat reciprocum: `Cantate Jehovae' 
significat quod Domino soli gloria: `quia exaltavit exaltando' significat quod manifestaverit Divinum Suum in Humano: `equum et equitem ejus projecit in mare' significat {2}ex eo quod ex sola praesentia 
Ipsius falsa fidei et mala vitae se conjecerint in infernum. 	@1 Hosch. xiv 9, Num. xxi 17 written above these words.  cp n. 8340.$ 	@2 in$ </p>
