<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4188.</strong>创世记31:44-46.来吧！现在我们立个约吧，我与你；就让它作你我中间的证据。雅各就拿一块石头立作柱子。雅各又对自己的弟兄说，你们堆聚石头。他们就拿石头来堆成一堆，在那一堆旁边吃。<br />“来吧！现在我们立个约吧，我与你；就让它作你我中间的证据”表神性属世层与那些在边上的人，就是外邦人所在的行为良善的结合。“雅各就拿一块石头立作柱子”表类似真理和基于此的敬拜。“雅各又对自己的弟兄说”表那些处于行为良善的人。“你们堆聚石头。他们就拿石头来堆成一堆”表由良善所产生的真理。“在那一堆旁边吃”表将出于神性良善的变成自己的。</p>

Verses 44-46. And now come, let us make a covenant, I and thou, and let it be for a witness between me and thee. And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar. And Jacob said unto his brethren, 
Gather stones; and they took stones, and made a heap, and they did eat there upon the heap. "And now come, let us make a covenant, I and thou, and let it be for a witness between me and thee," signifies 
the conjunction of the Divine natural with the goods of works, in which are they who are aside, or the Gentiles; "and Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar," signifies such truth and the derivative 
worship; "and Jacob said unto his brethren," signifies those who are in the good of works; "gather stones; and they took stones, and made a heap," signifies truths from good; "and they did eat 
there upon the heap," signifies appropriation from good Divine. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4188</b></p><p><b>4188.</b>
Verses 44-46 And now come, let us make a covenant, I and you, and let it be a witness between me and you. And Jacob took a stone and erected it as a pillar. And Jacob said to his brothers, Gather stones; 
and they took stones and made a heap; and they ate there upon the heap. </p>
<p>'Now come, let us make a covenant, I and you, and let it be a witness between me and you' means a joining of the Divine 
Natural to works inherently good that are done by people on the sidelines, that is, by the gentiles. 'And Jacob took a stone and erected it as a pillar' means a like truth and worship based on this. 'And 
Jacob said to his brothers' means people who perform works that are inherently good. 'Gather stones; and they took stones and made a heap' means truths arising out of good. 'And they ate there upon 
the heap' means making their own that which came from Divine good. </p>

Vers. 44-46.  Et nunc ito, pangamus foedus ego et tu, et sit in testem inter me et inter te. Et accepit Jacob lapidem, et erexit illum in statuam. Et dixit Jacob fratribus suis, Colligite lapides; 
et acceperunt lapides, et fecerunt acervum; et comederunt ibi super acervo `Nunc ito, pangamus foedus ego et tu, et sit in testem inter me e inter te' significat conjunctionem Divini Naturalis cum 
bonis operum in quibus illi qui a latere, seu gentes: </p>
<p>`et accepit Jacob lapidem, e erexit illum in statuam' significat verum tale et inde cultum: `et dixi Jacob fratribus suis' significat illos qui 
in bono operum: `Colligite lapides; et acceperunt lapides, et fecerunt acervum' significat vera ex bono: </p>
<p>`et comederunt ibi super acervo' significat appropriationem ex bono Divino. </p>
