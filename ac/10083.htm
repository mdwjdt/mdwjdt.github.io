<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10083节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10083</strong>.“作为摇祭，在耶和华面前摇一摇”表由此而来的神性生命或来自神的生命。这从“作为摇祭摇一摇”的含义清楚可知。“作为摇祭摇一摇”是指赋予生命，因而是指（存在于某种事物中的）生命；由于经上说“在耶和华面前”，故所表示的是神性生命或来自神的生命。“作为摇祭摇一摇”表示赋予生命，也就是赋予神性生命，或来自神的生命，这一点从圣言中提到“摇一摇”的经文明显看出来，如摩西五经：<br />你们要将初熟的庄稼一捆带给祭司，他要把这一捆在耶和华面前摇一摇，使你们得蒙悦纳。祭司要在安息日的次日，把这捆摇一摇。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利23.10.htm">23:10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利23.11.htm">11</a>）<br />“庄稼”表示当源于良善的信之真理存在时的一种状态，因而表示一种良善的状态（参看<a href="9295.htm">9295</a>节）；“初熟的庄稼一捆”表示集体构成该状态的一切；因此，“祭司摇一摇”表示被赋予生命以接受一种赐福；因为一切赐福若要成为一种赐福，就必须从神拥有生命在里面<br />民数记：<br />亚伦要从以色列人中将利未人作为摇祭在耶和华面前摇一摇，使他们事奉耶和华。你也要使利未人站在亚伦和他儿子面前，将他们当作摇祭摇一摇献给耶和华。此后利未人要进会幕服事；你要洁净他们，将他们当作摇祭摇一摇。于是利未人得了洁净，亚伦将他们当作摇祭在耶和华面前摇一摇，亚伦又为他们赎罪，洁净他们。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民8.11.htm">8:11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民8.13.htm">13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民8.15.htm">15</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民8.21.htm">21</a>）<br />由此可见“摇着摇祭或作为摇祭摇一摇”表示什么，即：通过承认赋予生命，承认是信的第一个阶段，因而是与一个人同在的来自神的生命的第一个阶段。诚然，知识先于承认到来，但知识没有丝毫神的生命在自己里面，除非它变成承认，然后变成信。利未人代表服事良善的真理，而亚伦代表它们所服事的良善；这就是为何他们被“摇一摇”，也就是被赋予生命。这也解释为何经上说，他们要“洁净”，因为真理若要服事良善，就必须拥有来自神的生命在自己里面，这生命首先通过承认流入。<br />在摩西五经中，“金子的摇祭”所表相同：<br />他们都来，连男带女；各将胸前针、鼻环、戒指和手钏，各样金器都带来；各人摇着金子的摇祭献给耶和华。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出35.22.htm">35:22</a>）<br />“摇着金子的摇祭献给耶和华”表示通过承认它是耶和华的，也就是说，是主的而赋予生命。“摇着摇祭或作为摇祭摇一摇”具有这种含义凭的是这种行为所对应的东西，因为一切动作皆对应于一种思维状态。因此，在圣言中，行进、旅行和类似移动都表示生命的状态（<a href="3335.htm">3335</a>，<a href="4882.htm">4882</a>，<a href="5493.htm">5493</a>，<a href="5605.htm">5605</a>，<a href="8103.htm">8103</a>，<a href="8417.htm">8417</a>，<a href="8420.htm">8420</a>，<a href="8557.htm">8557</a>节）。<br />约翰福音：<br />毕士大的池子里面躺着许多病人。因为有天使按时下池子搅动那水。水动之后，谁先浸到里面，无论害什么病就痊愈了。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约5.2.htm">5:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约5.7.htm">7</a>）<br />“搅动那水”在此同样表示通过承认和信而赋予生命，因而也表示通过真理洁净。“移动”表示生命状态（参看<a href="2837.htm">2837</a>，<a href="3356.htm">3356</a>，<a href="3387.htm">3387</a>，<a href="4321.htm">4321</a>，<a href="4882.htm">4882</a>，<a

href="3424.htm">3424</a>，<a href="4976.htm">4976</a>，<a href="8568.htm">8568</a>，<a href="9323.htm">9323</a>节）；一切洁净都通过信之真理实现（参看<a href="2799.htm">2799</a>，<a href="5954.htm">5954</a>e，<a href="7044.htm">7044</a>，<a href="7918.htm">7918</a>，<a href="9088.htm">9088</a>节）；痊愈代表属灵生命的恢复（参看<a href="8365.htm">8365</a>，<a href="9031.htm">9031</a>e节）。<br /><br />由于“在亚伦的手掌上摇一摇”表示通过对主的承认，以及对一切事物皆来自祂的承认而赋予生命，故必须简要说一说这种承认和由此而来的信。<br />当病人得医治时，主常说，他们要“有信”、“照着他们的信给他们成全”（如马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太8.10.htm">8:10</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太8.13.htm">13</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/太9.2.htm">9:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太9.22.htm">22</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太9.27.htm">27</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太9.29.htm">29</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.57.htm">13:57</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.58.htm">58</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/太15.28.htm">15:28</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/太21.21.htm">21:21</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太21.22.htm">22</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太21.31.htm">31</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太21.32.htm">32</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可5.34.htm">5:34</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/可5.36.htm">36</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/可10.49.htm">10:49</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/可10.52.htm">52</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路7.9.htm">7:9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路7.48.htm">48</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路7.50.htm">50</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/路8.48.htm">8:48</a>；<a

href="http://39-27.cn/路18.43.htm">43</a>）。主之所以说这话，是因为一个人需要做的第一件事就是承认主是世界的救世主；因为没有这种承认，没有人能从天堂接受任何真理或良善，因而能从那里接受信。由于这是首先和最重要的事，所以当主降世时，为叫自己可以得到承认，祂在医治病人时首先会问他们的信，那些有信的人就得了医治。这信就是，祂是那要降世的神的儿子，祂有医治和拯救的能力。此外，主在世时对疾病的一切医治都表示属灵生命的医治，因而表示属于拯救的事物（<a href="8364.htm">8364</a>，<a href="9031.htm">9031</a>e，<a href="9086.htm">9086</a>节）。<br />由于对主的承认是属于属灵生命的一切事当中的第一件事，是教会最基本的特征，还由于没有这种承认，没有人能从天堂接受任何信之真理或爱之良善，所以主也常说，凡信祂的，就有永生，凡不信祂的，没有永生（如约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.1.htm">1:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.4.htm">4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.12.htm">12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.13.htm">13</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.14.htm">3:14</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.16.htm">16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.36.htm">36</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约5.39.htm">5:39</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约5.40.htm">40</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.28.htm">6:28</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.30.htm">30</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.34.htm">34</a>，<a

href="http://39-27.cn/约7.37.htm">7:37</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约7.38.htm">38</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约8.24.htm">8:24</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约11.25.htm">11:25</a>，<a

href="http://39-27.cn/约20.31.htm">31</a>）。但祂同时也教导说，照祂的诫命生活，以便由此产生的生命构成其信的人拥有对祂的信。阐述这些事是为了说明并证实这一事实：对主的承认和对一切救恩皆来自祂的承认构成与一个人同在的来自神的生命的开始。“在亚伦手掌上摇一摇”就表示生命的这个开始。</p>

And shalt wave them a wave-offering before Jehovah. That this signifies the consequent Divine life, is evident from the signification of "waving a wave-offering," as being to vivify, thus life; and because 
it is said "before Jehovah," Divine life is signified. That "to wave a wave-offering" denotes to vivify, that is, to give Divine life, is evident from the passages in the Word where "waving a wave-offering" 
is mentioned, as in Moses: </p>
<p>     When ye shall bring the sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest, he shall wave the sheaf before Jehovah to make you well pleasing; on the 
morrow of the Sabbath the priest shall wave it (Lev. 23:10, 11). by the "harvest" is signified the state of the truth of faith from good, thus the state of good (see n. 9295); by "the sheaf of the 
firstfruits" is signified its state collectively; hence by "being waved by the priest" is signified being vivified to receive a blessing; for every blessing, in order to be a blessing, must have life 
in it from the Divine. [2] Again: </p>
<p>     Aaron shall wave the Levites a wave-offering before Jehovah from among the sons of Israel, that they may be for ministering the ministry to Jehovah. Thou shalt 
set the Levites before Aaron, and before his sons, and shalt wave them a wave-offering to Jehovah. Afterward shall the Levites come to minister in the Tent of meeting; and thou shalt purify them, and 
shalt wave them a wave-offering. And when the Levites were purified, and Aaron waved them a wave-offering before Jehovah; and expiated them to purify them (Num. 8:11, 13, 15, 21). From all this it can 
be seen what is meant by "waving a wave offering," namely, that it denotes to vivify by acknowledgment, which is the first of life from the Divine with man. Knowledge does indeed precede acknowledgment, 
but there is nothing of Divine life in knowledge until it becomes acknowledgment, and then faith. The Levites represented truths ministering to good, and Aaron represented the good to which they 
ministered; therefore the Levites were "waved," that is, were vivified; and therefore it is also said that they were to be "purified," for life from the Divine must be in truths in order that they may 
minister to good, and this life first flows in by means of acknowledgment. [3] The like is signified by the "waving of gold" in Moses: </p>
<p>     The men came with the women, and brought a clasp, a nose-ring, 
gold, a girdle, all vessels of gold, every man who waved a wave-offering of gold to Jehovah (Exod. 35:22); </p>
<p>"to wave a wave-offering of gold to Jehovah" denotes to vivify by the acknowledgment 
that it was Jehovah's, that is, the Lord's. That "to wave a wave-offering" has such a signification is from correspondence, for all motion corresponds to a state of thought; hence progressions, journeyings, 
and the like, which belong to motion, in the Word signify states of life (n. 3335, 4882, 5493, 5605, 8103, 8417, 8420, 8557). [4] In John: </p>
<p>     At the pool of Bethesda lay a great multitude of 
them that were sick. And at a certain time an angel went down unto the pool, and troubled the water; whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in, was made whole, with whatever disease 
he was holden (John 5:2-7). By "troubling the water" was here likewise signified vivification through acknowledgment and faith, thus also purification through truths. (That motion signifies states 
of life, see n. 2837, 3356, 3387, 4321, 4882, 5605, 7381, 9440, 9967; and that "waters" denote the truths of faith, n. 2702, 3058, 3424, 4976, 8568, 9323; that all purifications are effected through 
the truths of faith, n. 2799, 5954, 7044, 7918, 9088; and that healings represented restorations of spiritual life, n. 8365, 9031.) [5] As by the "waving upon the palms of Aaron" is signified vivification 
through the acknowledgment of the Lord, and that all things are from Him, therefore a few words shall be said about this acknowledgment and the faith thence derived. It was often said by the 
Lord, when the sick were healed, that they should "have faith," and that it would be done to them "according to their faith" (as Matt. 8:10-13; 9:2, 22, 27-29; 13:57, 58; 15:28; 21:21, 22, 31, 32; Mark 
5:34, 36; 10:49, 52; Luke 7:9, 48-50; 8:48; 17:19; 18:42, 43). The reason was that the first of all is to acknowledge that the Lord is the Savior of the world, for without this acknowledgment no one 
can receive anything of truth and good from heaven, thus no faith; and because this is the first and most essential of all, therefore in order that the Lord might be acknowledged when He came into the 
world, in healing the sick He questioned them concerning their faith, and those who had faith were healed. The faith was that He was the Son of God who was to come into the world, and that He had power 
to heal and to save. Moreover, all the healings of diseases by the Lord, when He was in the world, signified healings of the spiritual life, thus the things that belong to salvation (n. 8364, 9031, 
9086). [6] Because the acknowledgment of the Lord is the first of all things of spiritual life, and the most essential thing of the church, and because without it no one can receive from heaven anything 
of the truth of faith and the good of love, therefore the Lord often says that he who "believeth in Him hath eternal life," that he who "doth not believe hath not life" (as John 1:1, 4, 12, 13; 
3:14-16, 36; 5:39, 40; 6:28-30, 34, 35, 40, 47, 48; 7:37, 38; 8:24; 11:25, 26; 20:30 ,31); but he also teaches at the same time that those have faith in Him who "live according to His precepts," so that 
the consequent life may enter into the faith. All this has been said to illustrate and confirm the fact, that the acknowledgment of the Lord, and that from Him is all salvation, is the first of life 
from the Divine with man. This first of life is signified by the "wavings upon the palms of Aaron." </p>

'And you shall wave them as a wave offering before Jehovah' means the life from God which comes as a result of this. This is clear from the meaning of 'waving a wave offering' as endowing with life, 
thus the life [present in something]; and since it says from 'before Jehovah' the life from God is meant. The fact that 'waving a wave offering' means endowing with life, that is, imparting the life from 
God, is clear from places in the Word where 'waving a wave offering' is spoken of, as in Moses,  </p>
<blockquote>
When you bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest to the priest, he shall wave the sheaf 
before Jehovah, so that you may be acceptable; on the day after the sabbath the priest shall wave it. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%2023:10,11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 23:10,11</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'Harvest' means a state when the truth of faith springing from good exists, thus 
a state when good is present, <a href="9295.htm">9295</a>; 'a sheaf of the firstfruits' means all collectively constituting that state. 'Being waved by the priest' therefore means being endowed with life to receive a blessing; 
for every blessing, to be a blessing, must have life from God within it.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In the same author,  </p>
<blockquote>
Aaron shall wave the Levites before Jehovah as a wave offering<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> from among the children 
of Israel, that they may be used in the service of Jehovah. You shall stand the Levites before Aaron and before his sons, and you shall wave them as a wave offering to Jehovah. After that the Levites 
shall go in to serve in the tent of meeting; and you shall purify them, and wave them as a wave offering. And when the Levites had been purified, Aaron waved them before Jehovah as a wave offering, and 
Aaron expiated them to purify them. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%208:11,13,15,21&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 8:11,13,15,21</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>These verses show what 'waving a wave offering' means, namely endowing with life through acknowledgement, which is the first phase of faith, 
and so the first phase of life from God with a person. Knowledge, it is true, comes before acknowledgement, but knowledge has none of God's life within it until it becomes acknowledgement and then 
faith. The Levites represented truths serving good, while Aaron represented the good they served; that is why they were 'waved', that is, were endowed with life. This also accounts for its being said 
that they were to be purified. For truths must have life from God within them if they are to serve good, and that life first flows in through acknowledgement.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Much the same is meant by 'a wave 
offering of gold' in Moses,  </p>
<blockquote>
They came, the men with the women ... they brought brooches, nose-jewels, rings, girdles<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a>, all vessels of gold; and every man who waved a wave offering of gold to Jehovah.

</blockquote>
<p>'Waving a wave offering of gold to Jehovah' means endowing with life through the acknowledgement that it was Jehovah's, that is, the Lord's. 'Waving a wave offering' means such 
things by virtue of what that action corresponds to; for every motion corresponds to a state of thought. In the Word therefore advancing, travelling on, and like movements mean states of life, see <a href="3335.htm">3335</a>, <a href="4882.htm">4882</a>, <a href="5493.htm">5493</a>, <a href="5605.htm">5605</a>, <a href="8103.htm">8103</a>, <a href="8417.htm">8417</a>, <a href="8420.htm">8420</a>, <a href="8557.htm">8557</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In John,  </p>
<blockquote>
At the pool of Bethesda lay a large multitude of sick people; and an angel went down at a certain time to the pool and stirred up the 
water. Then whoever stepped in first after the movement of the water was cured of whatever disease he had. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%205:2-7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 5:2-7</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'Stirring up the water' here was in like manner a sign of the endowment of life 
through acknowledgement and faith, and therefore also a sign of purification by means of truths.  </p>

<p><b>[5]</b>
 Since 'the waving on Aaron's palms' means the endowment of life through acknowledgement of the Lord and the acknowledgement that all things come from 
Him, something brief must be stated with regard to that acknowledgement and resulting faith. The Lord often said, when sick people were being healed, that they should have faith, and, 'Let it be to 
you according to your faith', as in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%208:10-13;%209:2,22,27-29;%2013:57,58;%2015:28;%2021:21,22,31,32&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 8:10-13; 9:2,22,27-29; 13:57,58; 15:28; 21:21,22,31,32</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%205:34,36;%2010:49,52;%2016&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 5:34,36; 10:49,52; 16</a>[:16]; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%207:9,48-50;%208:48;%2017:19;%2018:42,43&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 7:9,48-50; 8:48; 17:19; 18:42,43</a>. The reason why He said it was 
that the very first thing a person needs to do is to acknowledge that the Lord is the Saviour of the world; for unless he acknowledges this no one can receive any truth or good at all from heaven, or 
therefore receive faith from there. And since it was the very first and most essential thing, therefore in order that He might be acknowledged when He came into the world the Lord questioned the sick, 
when He healed them, about their faith; and those who had faith were healed. This faith was that He was the Son of God who was to come into the world, and that He had power to heal and save. Furthermore 
every healing of sickness by the Lord when He was in the world served to mean a healing of spiritual life, thus served to mean the things that belong to salvation, <a href="8364.htm">8364</a>, <a href="9031.htm">9031</a>(end), <a href="9086.htm">9086</a>.  </p>

Since acknowledgement of the Lord is the first thing of all belonging to spiritual life and is the most essential feature of the Church, and since no one, unless he acknowledges Him, can receive any 
truth of faith or good of love at all from heaven, the Lord also often says that whoever believes in Him has eternal life, and whoever does not believe in Him does not have it, as in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%201:1,4,12,13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 1:1,4,12,13</a>; 
3:14-16,<a href="36.htm">36</a>; 5:39,<a href="40.htm">40</a>; 6:28-30,<a href="33.htm">33</a>-<a href="35.htm">35</a>,<a href="40.htm">40</a>,<a href="47.htm">47</a>,<a href="48.htm">48</a>; 7:37,<a href="38.htm">38</a>; 8:24; 11:25,<a href="26.htm">26</a>; 20:30,<a href="31.htm">31</a>. But at the same time He also teaches that they have faith in Him who live according to His commandments, so that the life 
which results from doing so goes to compose their faith. These things have been stated to cast light on and corroborate the truth that acknowledging the Lord and acknowledging that all salvation comes 
from Him constitute the beginning of the life from God with a person. That beginning of it is meant by the offering waved on Aaron's palms.

`Et agitabis illa agitationem coram Jehovah': quod significet inde vitam Divinam, constat ex significatione `agitare agitationem' quod sit vivificare, ita vita; et quia dicitur a `coram Jehovah,' significatur 
vita Divina {1}.  Quod `agitare agitationem' sit vivificare seu vitam Divinam dare, constat a locis in Verbo ubi `agitare agitationem' dicitur, ut apud Moschen, 	Cum adfertis manipulum primitiarum 
messis vestrae sacerdotem, agitabit manipulum {2} coram Jehovah in beneplacitum vestri; a crastino sabbati agitabit illum, sacerdos, Lev. xxiii 10, 11; </p>
<p>per `messem' significatur status veri 
fidei ex bono, ita status boni, n. 9295, per manipulum primitiarum' significatur' collectim {3} ejus status; inde per `agitari a sacerdote' significatur vivificari ad recipiendum benedictionem; omnis 
enim benedictio vitam a Divino in se habebit, ut sit benedictio: apud eundem, 	Aharon agitabit Levitas agitationem coram Jehovah a cum filiis Israelis, ut sint ad ministrandum ministerium Jehovae. Statues 
Levitas ante Aharonem et ante filios ejus, et agitabis eos agitationem Jehovae: postea venient Levitae ad ministrandum in tentorio conventus, et purificabis eos, et agitabis eos agitationem: cumque 
purificati sunt Levitae, et Aharon agitavit eos agitationem coram Jehovah, et expiavit eos Aharon ad purificandum eos, Num. viii 11, 13, 15, 21; </p>
<p>quid `agitare agitationem,' ex his constare potest, 
quod nempe sit vivificare per agnitionem, quae est primum fidei, ita primum vitae a Divino apud hominem; cognitio quidem praecedit agnitionem, sed cognitioni nihil vitae Divinae inest priusquam {4} 
fit agnitio, et dein fides; Levitae repraesentabant vera ministrantia bono, ac Aharon repraesentabat bonum cui ministrabant, ideo illi agitabantur, hoc est, vivificabantur; quapropter etiam dicitur quod 
{5} purificandi, nam {6} veris inerit vita a Divino ut ministrent bono, {7} ac vita illa primum influit per agnitionem {8} 	Simile per agitationem auri significatur apud Moschen, 	Venerunt viri cum 
feminis, {9} attulerunt fibulam, monile, aurum, cingulum, omnia vasa auri, et omnis vir qui agitavit agitationem auri Jehovae, Exod. xxxv 22; </p>
<p>`agitare agitationem auri Jehovae' est vivificare per 
agnitionem, quod Jehovae, hoc est, Domini esset. Quod `agitare agitationem' talia significet, est ex correspondentia, {10} omnis namque motus correspondet statui cogitationis; inde {11} progressiones, 
profectiones, et similia quae motus sunt, in Verbo significant status vitae, videatur n. 3335, 4882: 5493, (x)5605, 8103, 8417, 8420, 8557: apud Johannem, 	Ad lacum Bethesdam jacebat multitudo ingens 
aegrotorum, et angelus certo tempore descendebat ad lacum et commovit aquam qui tunc prius ingrediebatur post motum aquae, sanus factus es quocumque teneretur morbo, v 2-7; </p>
<p>per `commovere aquam' hic 
similiter {12} significabatur vivificatio per agnitionem et fidem, ita quoque purificatio per vera; {13}quod `motus' significet status vitae, videatur n. 2837, 3356, 3387, 4321, 4882, (x)5605, 7381, 
9440, 9967, et quod `aquae' sint vera fidei, n. 2702, 3058, 3424, 4976, 8568, 9323; quod omnes purificationes fiant per vera fidei, n. 2799, 5954 fin., 7044, 7918, (x)9088, et quod sanationes repraesentaverint 
restitutiones vitae spiritualis, n. 8365, 9031 fin.       (m){14} Quoniam per `agitationem super volis Aharonis' significatur {15}vivificatio per agnitionem Domini, et quod ab Ipso omnia, 
{16}ideo de agnitione illa et inde fide, paucis dicetur: (n) a Domino saepe dictum est, cum aegroti sanabantur, quod fidem haberent, et {17}ut fiat illis secundum fidem, ut Matth. viii 10-13, ix 2, 22, 
27-29, xiii 57, 58, xv 28, xxi 21, 22, 31, 32; Marc. v 34, 36, x 49, 52, xvi;Luc. viii 9, 48-50, viii 48, xvii 19, xviii 42, 43; causa erat quia omnium primum est agnoscere quod Dominus sit Salvator 
mundi, {18}nam absque illa agnitione nemo (t)recipere potest aliquid veri et boni e caelo, ita nec fidem, et quia id omnium primum et essentialissimum est, ideo, ut agnosceretur Dominus cum in mundum 
venit, cum sanavit aegrotos, interrogavit de fide, et qui fidem habebant sanabantur: fides erat quod Ipse esset Filius Dei {19} venturus in mundum, et quod ei potestas sanandi et salvandi; omnes etiam 
sanationes morborum a Domino cum fuit in mundo, significabant sanationes vitae spiritualis, ita quae sunt salvationis, n. 8364, 9031 fin., (a)9086.       Quia agnitio Domini omnium primum vitae spiritualis 
est, et essentialissimum Ecclesiae, et quia absque illa nemo aliquid veri fidei ac boni amoris recipere potest e caelo, ideo Dominus etiam {20}saepe dicit quod qui credit in Ipsum, vitam aeternam 
habeat, et qui non credit non habeat, ut Joh. i 1, 4, 12, 13, iii 14-16, 36, v 39, 40, vi 28-30, 33, 34, 35, 40, 47, 48, vii 37, 38, viii 24, xi 25, 26, xx 30, 31; sed etiam simul docet quod illi 
fidem in Ipsum habeant qui vivunt secundum praecepta Ipsius, sic ut vita inde ingrediatur fidem. Haec dicta sunt ad illustrandum et confirmandum quod agnitio Domini, et quod ab Ipso omnis salvatio, sit 
primum vitae a Divino apud hominem; primum illud vitae significatur per `agitationes super volis Aharonis.' @1 ex Divino$ @2 i messis vestrae$ @3 omne ejus$ @4 sit IT$ @5 i sic$ @6 i omnis purificatio
