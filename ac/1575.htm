<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1575.</strong>创世记13:8. 亚伯兰就对罗得说，你我之间不可纷争，你的牧人和我的牧人之间也不可纷争，因为我们是兄弟。<br />“亚伯兰就对罗得说”表内在人对外在人如此说。“你我之间不可纷争，你的牧人和我的牧人之间也不可纷争”表这二者之间不应该有分歧。“因为我们是兄弟”表它们本身是结合在一起的。</p><br />

And Abram said to Lot, "Please, let us not have strife between me and you, and between my herders and your herders; because we are men who are brothers."<br />Abram said to Lot means that this is what his inner self said to his outer self. Please, let us not have strife between me and you, and between my herders and your herders means that there should be no discord between the two. Because we are men who are brothers means that in and of themselves they were unified. </p>

Verse 8. And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no contention, I pray, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen, for we are men brethren. "Abram said unto Lot," signifies that the internal 
man said thus to the external. "Let there be no contention, I pray, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen," signifies that there ought to be no disagreement between the two; 
"for we are men brethren," signifies that in themselves they were united. </p>

Verse 8 And Abram said to Lot, Let there not be strife, now, between me and you, and between my herdsmen and your herdsmen, for we are men who are brothers. </p>
<p>'Abram said to Lot' means that the internal 
man so addressed the external. 'Let there not be strife, now, between me and you, and between my herdsmen and your herdsmen' means that there ought to be no disagreement between the two 'For we are 
men who are brothers' means that they were in themselves united. </p>

</p><b>1575.</b>
Vers. 8.  Et dixit Abram ad Lotum, Ne quaeso sit contentio inter me et inter te, et inter pastores meos et inter pastores tuos, quia viri fratres nos. 'Dixit Abram ad Lotum' significat quod ita internus 
homo dixerit ad externum: 'ne quaeso sit contentio inter me et inter te, et inter pastores meos et inter pastores tuos' significat quod nulla discordia debeat esse inter utrumque: 'quia viri fratres 
nos' significat quod in: se uniti. </p>
