<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10514节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10514</strong>.他们也在我们地球灵面前展现了他们的圣殿，我们地球灵声称，他们从来没见过比这更壮丽的东西。它们还展现给我，我由此看出它们是如何建造的。它们是由树木建造的，不过不是砍下来的树，而是正在天然土壤中生长的树。他们说，这个星球上有极其高大的树木。当这些树还是幼苗时，他们就把它们排成行，好叫它们长成拱廊和林荫道。然后，趁这些树还幼小，他们通过砍掉或修剪树枝来塑造和培养它们，以便它们能交织缠错，形成将要建造的圣殿的殿基和硬地板。其它树枝在两侧竖起形成墙壁，而其余的在顶部弯曲，形成殿顶。他们就这样以惊人的技巧建造了这座高高耸立于地面的圣殿。他们还用伸展出来并紧密相连的一个水平面上的连续枝条提供了一条上升的通道。此外，他们还用形成各种形状的树叶以各种方式里里外外装饰圣殿。他们通过这种方式建造了一整片树林。不过，我未蒙允许看见这些圣殿里面是什么样子，只看见阳光透过枝条间的开口进入，透过水晶撒遍各个角落；这些水晶将墙周围的阳光分解成各种彩虹般的颜色，尤其分解成他们最喜欢的蓝色和橙色。这些就是他们在建筑技巧上的绝妙壮举，他们喜欢这些胜过我们地球上最宏伟、壮丽的宫殿，我们的灵人也钦佩、赞扬它们胜过这些宫殿。</p>

They also represented their holy edifices before the spirits of our earth, who said that they had never seen anything more magnificent. They were also represented to me, and the manner of their construction 
was consequently seen. They are constructed of trees, not cut down, but growing in their native soil. They said that on that earth there are trees of extraordinary growth and height. These they 
set in rows when young, that they may serve for porticoes and arboreal walks;* and while their branches are tender they adapt and prepare them by means of cuttings and prunings to entwine one with another 
and join themselves together, so as to form the groundwork and floor of the edifice to be constructed; and other branches at the sides rise to serve as walls; and yet others bend into arches above 
to form the roof. In this manner they construct the edifice with wonderful art, raised high above the ground. They also prepare an ascent into it by means of continuous branches of trees, stretched 
out and firmly connected together. Moreover, they adorn this edifice in various ways, both without and within, by fastening the leaves together into forms. So do they build an entire grove. But it was 
not granted me to see the nature of the interior of these edifices, except that the light of their sun is let in through openings between the branches, and is everywhere transmitted through crystals, 
whereby the light all round the walls is variegated into colors like those of the rainbow, especially the colors blue and orange, which they love more than the other colors. Such is the nature of their 
architecture, which they prefer to the most magnificent palaces of our earth, and which was also esteemed and praised above these by the spirits of our earth. * Beneath the edifice; see n. 10516

They also represented their temples before the eyes of spirits belonging to our planet, who said that they had seen nothing more magnificent. They were represented to me as well, from which I saw how 
they were constructed. They were constructed of trees, not of ones that had been cut down but of those growing in their natural soil. They said that on that planet there were trees wonderfully tall and 
high. They set them out in rows when these are saplings to grow into arcades and avenues. Then they shape and train the branches while these are still young by cutting and pruning them so that they 
may interweave and combine together to form the base and hard floor of the temple to be constructed. Other branches rise up at the sides to form the walls, while others bow at the top to form the roof. 
In this way the temple is constructed by them with astonishing skill, raised high up above the ground, to which they also provide a way up by means of a continuous succession of horizontal tree-branches 
firmly linked together. In addition they decorate that temple in various ways outside and in with foliage formed into shapes. By this means they construct an entire grove. But I was not allowed 
to see what those temples are like inside, except to see that the light of their sun is let in through openings among the branches, and in various places passes through crystals, which split the light 
into various rainbow-like colours around the walls, especially blues and oranges, which they like more than all others. These are their wonderful feats of architectural skill which they prefer to the 
most magnificent palaces on our planet, and which our spirits too admired and praised more than these palaces.  </p>

Repraesentabant etiam sacras suas aedes coram spiritibus nostrae telluris, qui dicebant quod magnificentius nihil viderint; repraesentatae etiam sunt mihi, inde visae quomodo construuntur; construuntur 
ex arboribus non caesis sed in nativo suo solo crescentibus; dicebant quod in tellure illa essent arbores admiranda proceritate et altitudine; illas a suis initiis disponunt in ordines ut sint in 
porticus et in ambulacra; ac ramos earum a teneris aptant et parant per sectiones et putationes ut consertent et conjungant se pro aedis construendae solo et pavimento, et alii ad latera se elevent pro 
parietibus et alii superne inflectant se in arcus pro tecto; inde construunt aedem admiranda arte, elevatam alte supra terram, in quam etiam ascensum parant per continuos ramos arborum, exporrectos 
et firmiter connexos.  Insuper exornant aedem illam extra et intra variis modis, per applicationes frondium in formas; ita aedificant integrum lucum.  Sed quales sunt illae aedes intus, (x)non videre 
datum est, solum quod lux solis eorum intromittatur per aperturas inter ramos, ac passim transmittatur per crystalla, per quae lux variegatur in colores quasi iridis circum parietes, imprimis in colores 
caeruleos et aurantios, quos prae reliquis amant.  Haec sunt illorum architectonica, quae praeferunt palatiis magnificentissimis nostrae telluris; etiam prae his a nostris spiritibus aestimata et collaudata sunt. </p>
