<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8881节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8881.</strong>“守我诫命的”表接受信之真理的。这从“诫命”的含义清楚可知，“诫命”是指信之真理（<a href="3382.htm">3382</a>，<a href="8362.htm">8362</a>节）。“守”这些真理之所以表示接受它们，是因为被称为信之真理的真理若要成为与一个人同在的信之真理，并拥有生命在里面，也要从主流入。诚然，一个人会学习它们，将其存储在他的记忆中；但只要此人不意愿它们，因而不行出它们，它们就不会变成活的，或说没有任何生命在里面。然而，当它们从记忆中被提取出来，并通过他的理解力被引入他的意愿，也就是通过思维进入情感，进而进入行为时，它们就活了，或说拥有生命在里面，并成为信之真理。当人停止邪恶时，这一切就会被主成就。如刚才所述（<a href="8880.htm">8880</a>节）。</p>

And keep My commandments. That this signifies who receive the truths of faith, is evident from the signification of "commandments," as being the truths of faith (n. 3382, 8362). That "to keep" these 
denotes to receive, is because in order that the truths which are called the truths of faith may be of faith, and may be living with a man, these also flow in from the Lord. They are indeed learned by 
the man, and stored up in the memory, but so long as the man does not will them, and consequently does not do them, they do not become living. But when they are brought forth from the memory, and are 
insinuated through the intellectual into the will, that is, through the thought into the affection, and thence into act, they then become living, and are truths of faith. This is effected by the Lord 
when the man desists from evils (as was said just above, n. 8880). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8881</b></p><p><b>8881.</b>
'And keep My commandments' means who receive the truths of faith. This is clear from the meaning of 'commandments' as the truths of faith, dealt with in <a href="3382.htm">3382</a>, <a href="8362.htm">8362</a>. The reason why 'keeping' them means 
receiving them is that truths which are called the truths of faith - if they are to be those of faith with a person and have life in them - also flow in from the Lord. A person, it is true, learns them 
and stores them in his memory; but as long as they are not in the person's will and he does not therefore do them, they do not come to have any life in them. When however they are brought out of store 
in his memory and introduced by way of his understanding into his will, that is, through thought into affection and therefore into action, they come to have life in them and to be truths of faith. 
This is accomplished by the Lord when the person refrains from evils, as stated immediately above in <a href="8880.htm">8880</a>. </p>

</p><b>8881.</b>
`Et custodientibus praecepta Mea': quod significet qui recipiunt vera fidei, constat ex significatione `praeceptorum' quod sint vera fide, de qua n. 3382, 8362; quod illa custodire sit recipere, est 
quia vera quae fidei vocantur, ut sint fidei ac {1} ut vivant apud hominem, etiam influunt a Domino; discuntur quidem ab homine et reponuntur in memoria, sed quamdiu homo non vult illa et inde non facit 
illa, non fiunt viva; (m)cum autem e memoria depromuntur et per intellectuale insinuantur voluntati, hoc est, per cogitationem affectioni et inde actui, tunc fiunt viva et sunt fidei;(n) hoc fit a 
Domino quando homo desistit a malis, ut mox supra n. 8880 dictum est. @1 et sic$ </p>
