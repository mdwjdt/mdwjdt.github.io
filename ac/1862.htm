<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1862节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1862.</strong>“从那些肉块中经过”表它使那些属于教会的人与主隔离。这从前面所述（10节）清楚可知：动物从中间被劈成两半表示属天事物方面的平行和对应；一半对着另一半摆列表示教会和主；中间的空隙或间隔表介于主与教会，或主与教会成员之间的东西，也就是良知，良善与真理通过仁爱被植入在这良知中。当仇恨取代仁爱，恶与假取代善与真时，对善与真的良知就不复存在了。而这个中间空隙或间隔看似充满冒烟的炉和烧着的火把，即充满谬念和仇恨，它们就是将主与教会完全隔离之物。<br />这些就是“从那些肉块中经过”所表示的事物，尤其是烧着的火把，也就是我欲，或也可说，仇恨的邪恶。这也清楚可见于耶利米书，那里几乎出现了同样的话：<br />那些违背我约的人，就是不遵守在我面前立约之话的，我要使他们象那劈成两半的牛犊，使人从切块中经过：犹大的首领，耶路撒冷的首领，太监，祭司，和这地的众民曾将牛犊劈开，分成两半，我必将他们交在仇敌和寻索其命的人手中；他们的尸首必给空中的飞鸟和地上的走兽作食物。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶34.18.htm">34:18</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶34.20.htm">20</a>）</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1862.</strong> That passed between those pieces means that this fever separated people in the church from the Lord. This can be seen from the discussion above at verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1862/bible_king-james-version_genesis_15_10" target=_top>10</a> about splitting the animals in half, which symbolized parallelism and correspondence regarding heavenly things [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1862/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1830" target=_top>1830-1831</a>]. Placing one part across from its other [half] symbolized the church and the Lord. The middle or intervening space symbolized what connects the Lord and the church (or the Lord and an individual in the church), and what connects them is conscience, the soil in which goodness and truth are planted by means of charity.<br />When hatred replaces charity, and when evil and falsity replace goodness and truth, we have no conscientious awareness of goodness or truth. Instead, this middle, intervening space seems to be filled with a smoky furnace and fiery torches. That is, it seems to be filled with persuasive lies and with hatred, which are the entities that completely sever the Lord from the church.<br />[2] This is the symbolism of it passed between those pieces — mainly the torch of fire, or in other words, self-love, or in other words, the vice of hatred. This symbolism can also be seen in Jeremiah, where almost the same words appear:<br />The men transgressing my pact, who have not established the words of the pact that they struck before me — [witness] the calf that they cut in two and passed between the parts of: the chieftains of Judah and the chieftains of Jerusalem, the eunuchs and the priests and all the people of the land, passing between the parts of the calf — yes, I will give them into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those seeking their souls. And their corpse will serve for food for the bird of the heavens and the beast of the earth. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1862/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_34_14" target=_top>Jeremiah 34:14</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1862/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_34_18" target=_top>18</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1862/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_34_19" target=_top>19</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1862/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_34_20" target=_top>20</a>) </p>

That passed between those pieces. That this signifies that it separated those who were of the church from the Lord, may be seen from what was said above (at verse 10) concerning the partition of the 
animals in the midst, as signifying a parallelism and correspondence in respect to celestial things; and that one part being placed opposite the other signified the church and the Lord; and that the intermediate 
space or interspace signified that which comes in between the Lord and the church, or between the Lord and the man of the church, which is conscience, in which goods and truths have been implanted 
by means of charity. When hatreds succeed in place of charity, and evils and falsities in place of goods and truths, there is then no conscience of what is good and true; but this middle space 
or interspace appears to be filled with a furnace of smoke and with torches of fire, that is, with persuasions of falsity and with hatreds, which are what altogether separate the Lord from the church. 
 [2] These are the things signified by the passing between the pieces; chiefly that of the torch of fire, for this is the love of self, or what is the same, the evil of hatred. This may also be seen 
in Jeremiah, where we find nearly the same words: </p>
<p>     I will give the men who have transgressed My covenant, who have not established the words of the covenant which they made before Me, the calf 
which they cut in twain and passed between the parts thereof; the princes of Judah, and the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, and the priests, and all the people of the land, that passed between the 
parts of the calf; I will even give them into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their souls; and their carcass shall be for food to the fowl of the heavens and to the beast 
of the earth (Jer. 34:14, 18-20). </p>

'Which passed between the pieces' means that it divided off those who belonged to the Church from the Lord. This becomes clear from what has been stated above at verse 10 about the separation of the 
animals down the middle meaning parallelism and correspondence as regards celestial things, and about each part being laid opposite the other meaning the Church and the Lord, and about the space or interval 
in between meaning that which lies between the Lord and the Church, or the Lord and the member of the Church, namely a conscience in which goods and truths have been implanted by means of charity. 
When hatred has taken the place of charity, and evils and falsities the place of goods and truths, no conscience for what is good and true exists. Instead this space or interval in between appears 
as something filled up with a smoking furnace and a burning torch, that is, filled up with persuasions of falsity and with hatred, which are what separate the Lord completely from the Church. These are 
the things meant by 'it passed between those pieces', especially the flaming torch which is self-love, or what amounts to the same, the evil that is the product of hatred. This becomes clear also in 
Jeremiah where almost the same words occur, </p>
<blockquote>
I will make the men (vir) who transgressed My covenant and who did not keep the terms of the covenant which they made before Me like the calf which they 
cut in two and passed between its parts. The princes of Judah, and the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs and the priests, and all the people of the land who passed between the parts of the calf, and 
I will give them into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those who seek their souls, and their dead bodies will be food for the birds of the air<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> and the beasts of the earth. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2034:18-20&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 34:18-20</a>.

'Quae transivit inter segmenta illa': quod significet quod ille divisit illos qui fuerunt ab Ecclesia cum Domino, constare potest ab illis quae dicta sunt supra ad vers. 10 de partitione animalium in 
medium, quod significaverint parallelismum et correspondentiam quoad caelestia, et quod 'una pars poneretur obviam alteri' significaverit Ecclesiam et Dominum, quodque 'spatium intermedium' seu interstitium, 
illud quod inter Dominum et Ecclesiam, seu inter Dominum et hominem Ecclesiae, intercedit, quod est conscientia cui bona et vera per charitatem implantata sunt: quando loco charitatis succedunt 
odia, et loco bonorum et verorum mala et falsa, tunc nulla conscientia boni et veri, sed spatium hoc medium seu interstitium apparet sicut oppletum 'furno fumi et facibus ignis,' hoc est, oppletum 
persuasionibus falsi et odiis quae sunt quae prorsus separant Dominum ab Ecclesia; haec sunt quae significantur per quod 'ille transiret inter segmenta illa,' principaliter 'fax ignis' quae est amor 
sui, seu quo idem, malum odiorum; quod quoque constare potest apud Jeremiam ubi eadem paene verba, 	Dabo viros transgressos foedus Meum, qui non stabiliverunt verba foederis, quod pepigerunt coram Me, 
vitulum quem conciderunt in duas, et transiverunt inter partes ejus: principes Jehudae, et principes Hierosolymae, eunuchos, et sacerdote et omnem populum terrae, transeuntes inter partes vituli, et 
dabo eos in manum hostium eorum, et in manum quaerentium animas eorum, et erit cadaver eorum in cibum avi caelorum et bestiae terrae, xxxiv 14, 18-20. </p>
