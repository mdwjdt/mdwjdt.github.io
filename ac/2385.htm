<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2385节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2385.</strong>“这些人找门找得很烦躁”表以致他们看不见通向良善的任何真理。这从“门”的含义清楚可知，“门”是指引入或进入，是指真理本身，因为真理引向良善（参看<a href="2356.htm">2356</a>节）。不过，此处“门”表通向真理的认知；因为“门”（如前所述<a href="2356.htm">2356</a>节）在屋前部。由于第六节经上说“罗得出来，到门口，把身后的门关上”，因此“找门找得很烦躁”表示看不见通向良善的任何真理。<br />那些通过推理孵化教义，并且若非先理解它，就什么也不信的人就会变得如此，尤其在末世。在这种情况下，邪恶的生命不断流入其心智的理性部分，从邪恶情感之火所获得的一种幻光倾泻进来，使人视假为真，如那些常常在夜色中看到幽灵之人的情形。然后，这些事以多种方式被确认，并变成教义，如那些声称有功效的是构成思维的信，而非构成人情感的生命之人所持守的信条。<br />众所周知，无论什么样的设想，它一旦被接受，即便本身是假的，也能以无数种方式被确认，从而表面看上去，它仿佛就是真理本身。异端便由此而来，并且它们一经被确认，人们就不再从中退出。然而，从虚假设想所能流出的，无非是虚假；真理即便夹杂其中，当被用来确认虚假设想时，也会变成歪曲的真理，因为它们会被虚假的本质所玷污。<br />若所接受的是真理本身，情况则截然不同，这一点也是被证实了的。如，对主之爱和对邻之仁是一切法律和先知所言的总纲，因此是一切教义和敬拜的基本要素。在这种情况下，心智会被圣言中的无数事物所启示，否则，它会隐藏在虚假设想的模糊中。事实上，在这种情况下，异端会被驱散，一个教会便由许多个教会中产生，无论这个教会流出或引入该教会的教义和宗教仪式多么不同。<br />古教会就是这样，它传遍很多国家，如亚述、美索不达米亚、叙利亚、埃塞俄比亚、阿拉伯、利比亚、埃及、非利士，直到推罗、西顿，又传到约旦河两岸的迦南地。教义与仪式在这些人当中各不相同，但教会仍是一个，因为对他们来说，仁爱是本质的东西。那时，主的国度在地上如在天上，因为这就是天堂（参看<a href="684.htm">684</a>，<a href="690.htm">690</a>节）。若现在仍是这种情形，那么所有人在主的统领下就如同一个人；因为他们就象一具身体的各个部位和器官。虽然其形态和功能各不相同，但它们全都与一个心脏相关，每一个事物尽管在形态上处处不同，却都依赖于这个心脏。然后，每个人，无论他持何种教义、具有什么样的外在敬拜，都会说，这是我的兄弟；我发现他敬拜主，是个好人。</p>

And they labored to find the door. That this signifies so that they could not see any truth that would lead to good, is evident from the signification of a "door," as being introduction and access, and 
as being truth itself, because this introduces to good (see above, n. 2356). But here by the "door" are signified the knowledges that introduce to truth; for the "door" (as said above, n. 2356) was 
at the front of the house, for it is said that Lot "went out to the door, and shut the door behind him" (verse 6): hence to "labor to find the door," denotes not to see any truth that would lead to good. [2] 
Such do those become, especially in the last times, who by ratiocination hatch doctrinal things, and believe nothing unless they first apprehend it; for in this case the life of evil continually 
inflows into their rational, and a kind of fallacious light pours in from the fire of the affections of evil, and causes them to see falsities as truths; as are wont to do those who see phantoms 
in nocturnal light. These same things are then confirmed in many ways, and become matters of doctrine, such as are the doctrinal tenets of those who say that the life (which is of the affection) is of 
no efficacy, but only the faith (which is of the thought). [3] That every principle whatever, even if falsity itself, when once taken up, can be confirmed by innumerable things, and be presented in 
the outward form as if it were truth itself, may be known to everyone. Hence come heresies; from which, when once confirmed, the man never recedes. Yet from a false principle nothing but falsities can 
flow; and even if truths are interlarded among them, they became truths falsified when used to confirm a false principle, because they are contaminated by its essence. [4] Very different is the case 
when truth itself is received as a principle, and this is confirmed, as for example that love to the Lord and charity toward the neighbor are that on which hangs all the Law, and of which all the Prophets 
speak, and that they are therefore the essentials of all doctrine and worship; for in this case the mind would be illuminated by innumerable things in the Word, that otherwise lie hidden in the 
obscurity of a false principle. Nay, in such a case heresies would be dissipated, and one church would arise out of many, no matter how greatly the doctrinal and ritual matters that flowed from or led 
to it might differ. [5] Such was the ancient Church, which extended through many kingdoms, namely, Assyria, Mesopotamia, Syria, Ethiopia, Arabia, Libya, Egypt, Philistia as far as Tyre and Sidon, and 
through the land of Canaan on both sides the Jordan. Among these the doctrinal and ritual matters differed, but still the church was one, because to them charity was the essential thing. Then was there 
the Lord's kingdom on earth as in the heavens, for such is heaven (see n. 684, 690). If it were so now, all would be governed by the Lord as one man; for they would be as the members and organs of 
one body, which, although not of similar form, nor of similar function, yet all have relation to one heart, on which depend all and each in their several forms, that are everywhere varied. Then would 
each person say, in whatever doctrine and in whatever outward worship he might be, This is my brother, I see that he worships the Lord, and is a good man. </p>

'And these strove to find the door (janua)' means to the point at which they were unable to see any truth that would lead to good. This is clear from the meaning of 'a door' as something that introduces 
or affords access, and as truth itself since the latter leads the way to good, dealt with above in <a href="2356.htm">2356</a>. In this verse however 'the door' means cognitions which lead the way to truth, for 'the door 
(janua)', as stated above in <a href="2356.htm">2356</a>, was on the outside of the house, for it is said in verse 6 that 'Lot went out to the door (janua) and closed the door (ostia) behind him'. 'Striving to find the door' 
therefore means not seeing any truth that would lead to good. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Such do those people become, especially in the last times, who by reasoning hatch matters of doctrine and believe nothing unless 
they grasp it mentally beforehand. In this case the life of evil is constantly flowing into the rational part of their mind, and an illusory kind of light obtained from the fire of affections for evil 
pours in and causes men to see falsities as truths, like people who are in the habit of seeing phantoms in the shades of night. Those same things are after that confirmed in a multitude of ways and 
made matters of doctrine, as is the case with those who assert that life, which constitutes one's affection, does not achieve anything, but only faith, which constitutes thought. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Once any assumption 
is adopted, even if falsity itself, it can be confirmed in countless ways and so be presented to outward appearance as though it were the truth itself, as anyone may well know. This is how heresies 
arise from which there is no going back once they have been confirmed. But from a false assumption nothing other than falsities can flow; and even if truths are introduced among them, these nevertheless 
become falsified truths when that false assumption is confirmed by means of them, for they are polluted by the very nature of the falsity. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 It is altogether different if truth itself is 
the assumption that is taken, and this is confirmed; for example, that love to the Lord and charity towards the neighbour are that on which the whole law hangs and about which all the prophets speak, 
and so are the essentials of all doctrine and worship. In this case the mind would be enlightened by countless things in the Word which would otherwise lie hidden within the obscurity of a false assumption. 
Indeed in that case heresies would be dispelled and one Church would result from many, no matter how differing the doctrinal teachings and also religious practices might be flowing from that Church 
or leading into it. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 Of such a character was the Ancient Church which was spread throughout many kingdoms throughout Assyria, Mesopotamia, Syria, Ethiopia, Arabia, Libya, Egypt, Philistia up 
to Tyre and Sidon, and the land of Canaan on both sides of the Jordan. Among these peoples doctrinal teachings and religious practices differed from one to the next, but there was nevertheless one Church 
because with them charity was the essential thing. At that time the Lord's kingdom existed on earth as it is in heaven, for such is the character of heaven, see <a href="684.htm">684</a>, <a href="690.htm">690</a>. If the same situation existed 
now all would be governed by the Lord as though they were one person; for they would be like the members and organs of one body which, though dissimilar in form and function, still related to one 
heart on which every single thing, everywhere varied in form, depended. Everyone would then say of another, No matter what form his doctrine and his external worship take, this is my brother; I observe 
that he worships the Lord and is a good man. </p>

`Et laboraverunt ad inveniendum januam': quod significet usque ut non videre possent aliquid verum quod duceret ad bonum, constat a significatione `januae' quod sit introductio et aditus, et quod sit 
ipsum verum quia hoc introducit ad bonum, de qua supra n. 2356; hic autem per `januam' significantur cognitiones quae introducunt {1} ad verum; nam janua, ut supra n. 2356 dictum, erat ante domum, nam 
{2} dicitur quod Lot `exiverit ad januam, et ostium clauserit post se,' vers. 6, inde `laborare ad inveniendum januam' est non videre aliquid verum quod duceret ad bonum: tales fiunt illi, imprimis 
ultimis temporibus, qui ex ratiocinatione excludunt doctrinalia, ac nihil credunt nisi prius capiant; [2] vita mali tunc continue in rationale eorum influit, et quoddam lumen fallax ex igne affectionum 
mali infundit et facit ut videant falsa sicut ver quemadmodum solent qui in lumine nocturno vident phantasmata; eadem dein confirmantur multis, et fiunt doctrinalia; sicut sunt illorum qui dicunt quod 
vita quae est affectionis, nihil faciat, sed solum fides quae est cogitationis: [3] quod principium unumquodvis qualecumque sit, si vel foret ipsum falsum, semel captum, innumeris possit confirmari 
ac ita in externa forma sisti, sicut foret ipsum veram, cuivis non esse potest; inde haereses, a quibus semel confirmatis nusquam receditur: sed ex falso principio non nisi quam falsa profluunt, quibus 
si interjecta sunt vera, usque cum principium falsum per illa confirmatur, fiunt vera falsificata, quia inquinata ab essentia principii: [4] aliter prorsus si ipsum verum pro principio accipitur, et 
hoc confirmatur, ut pro exemplo quod amor in Dominum, et charitas erga proximum, sint a quibus pendet omnis lex et de quibus loquantur omnes prophetae, ac ita quod illa sint essentialia omnis doctrinae 
et cultus, tunc illuminaretur mens ab innumerabilibus quae in Verbo quae alioquin latent occultata in obscuro principii falsi; immo tunc dissiparentur haereses, et ex pluribus fieret una Ecclesia, 
utcumque doctrinalia inde fluentia aut illuc ducentia, tum ritualia, differrent; [5] talis fuit Antiqua Ecclesia, quae per {3} plura regna erat extensa, nempe per Assyriam, Mesopotamiam, Syriam, Aethiopiam, 
Arabiam, Lybiam, Aegyptum, Philistaeam usque ad Tyrum et Zidonem, per terram Canaanem cis et trans Jordanem; apud eos doctrinalia et ritualia differebant, sed usque Ecclesia una fuit quia charitas 
iis essentialis; et tunc fuit regnum Domini in terris sicut in caelis, nam caelum tale est, videatur n. 684, 690; si ita regerentur omnes sicut unus homo a Domino, forent enim sicut membra et organa 
unius corporis quae tametsi non simili forma nec simili functione, usque se referant ad unum cor, a quo omnia et singula in sua forma, quae ubivis varia, pendent; tunc quisque diceret [de alio]: {4}
