<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4138节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4138.</strong>“击鼓、弹竖琴”表在属灵良善方面，也就是说，（出于自我思想）它原以为自己在属灵良善方面会处于的状态。这从以下事实清楚可知：“鼓”和“竖琴”论及良善，不过是论及属灵的良善，这一点从圣言中的许多经文可以看出来。属灵良善就是那被称作信之良善的，是仁；而属天良善则是那称作爱之良善的，是对主之爱。主在天上有两个国度，其中一个被称作祂的属天国度，那些处于对主之爱的人就在这个国度；另一个被称作祂的属灵国度，那些处于对邻之仁的人就在这个国度。这两个国度彼此截然不同，互相分离，然而在天上却行如一体，并构成一体。关于这两个截然不同、互相分离的属天和属灵国度，可参看前面频繁所述。<br />很早以前的教会都会用到各种各样的乐器，如鼓、弦乐器、管乐器、竖琴、十弦乐器和许多其它乐器。其中一些乐器属于与属天事物有关的那一类，有些则属于与属灵事物有关的那一类。当这些乐器在圣言中被提及时，它们就含有这类属天或属灵事物，以至于一提到乐器就能知道所论述的是哪种良善，是属灵良善还是属天良善。鼓和竖琴就属于与属灵事物有关的那一类，故此处才说“在属灵良善方面”。“竖琴”论及属灵事物，弦乐器表示属灵事物，而管乐器，或吹奏乐器则表示属天事物（参看<a href="418.htm">418</a>-<a href="420.htm">420</a>节）。</p>

With timbrel, and with harp. That this signifies in respect to spiritual good (namely, the state in which from its own that good had believed itself to be in respect to spiritual good), is evident from 
the fact that "timbrel" and "harp" are predicated of good, but of spiritual good (as may be seen from many passages in the Word). Spiritual good is what is called the good of faith, and is charity; 
but celestial good is what is called the good of love, and is love to the Lord. There are two kingdoms of the Lord in the heavens; one of which is called His celestial kingdom, and in this kingdom are 
those who are in love to the Lord; and the other is called His spiritual kingdom, and in this are those who are in charity toward the neighbor. These kingdoms are most distinct from each other, but 
still in the heavens they act as and make a one. Concerning these distinct Celestial and Spiritual Kingdoms see what has already been frequently stated. [2] In the churches of ancient times there were 
employed many kinds of musical instruments, such as timbrels, psalteries, pipes, harps, decachords, and various others. Some of these belonged to the class of celestial, and some to the class of spiritual 
things; and when they are mentioned in the Word, such things are implied, insomuch that it may be known from them what kind of good is treated of, whether spiritual good or celestial good. The 
timbrel and the harp belonged to the class of spiritual things, and therefore it is here said "in respect to spiritual good." (That the "harp" is predicated of spiritual things, and that by stringed instruments 
are signified spiritual things, but by wind instruments celestial things, may be seen above, n. 418-420.) </p>

'With drums and with harps' means as regards spiritual good, that is to say, the state in which - thinking from the proprium - it had believed itself to be as regards that good. This is clear from the 
fact that 'drums and harps' has reference to good - spiritual good - as may be recognized from many places in the Word. Spiritual good is that which is called the good of faith, and is charity, whereas 
celestial good is that which is called the good of love, and is love to the Lord. The Lord has two kingdoms in the heavens, the first being called His celestial kingdom and consisting of those who 
are governed by love to the Lord, and the second being referred to as the spiritual kingdom and consisting of those who are governed by charity towards the neighbour. These kingdoms are quite distinct 
and separate, and yet in the heavens they act as one. Regarding these distinct and separate kingdoms - the celestial and the spiritual - see what has been stated many times already. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 In the Churches 
of long ago various kinds of musical instruments were used, such as drums, lyres, flutes, harps, instruments of ten strings, and many others. Some of these belonged to the group connected with 
celestial things, and some to the group connected with spiritual. When these instruments are mentioned in the Word they imply such celestial or spiritual things, so that from the instrument mentioned 
one can know which kind of good forms the subject - whether spiritual good or celestial good. Drums and harps belonged to the group connected with spiritual things, and that is why the phrase 'as regards 
spiritual good' is being used in this paragraph. For 'a harp' is used in reference to spiritual things, and stringed instruments serve to mean spiritual things, but wind instruments celestial ones, 
see <a href="418.htm">418</a>-<a href="420.htm">420</a>. </p>

</p><b>4138.</b>
`In tympano et in cithara': quod significet quoad bonum spirituale, nempe statum in quo tunc ex proprio credidisset quod fuisset quoad bonum illud, constat ex eo quod `tympanum et cithara' praedicentur 
de bono, sed de bono spirituali, ut ex pluribus locis in estque charitas; bonum caeleste autem est quod vocatur bonum amoris, estque amor in Dominum; sunt bina regna Domini in caelis, unum vocatur 
regnum caeleste Ipsius, et in illo sunt ii qui in amore in Dominum sunt, et alterum dicitur regnum spirituale, et in illo sunt qui in charitate erga proximum sunt; haec regna distinctissima 
sunt sed usque in caelis unum agant; de distinctis illis regnis, seu de caelesti et spirituali, videantur quae prius multoties dicta sunt.  [2] Olim in Ecclesiis adhibebantur varia genera instrumentorum 
musicorum, sicut tympana, nablia, tibiae, citharae, decachordia, et plura (o)alia; quaedam illorum pertinebant ad classem caelestium, quaedam autem ad classem spiritualium; haec cum nominantur 
in Verbo, involvunt talia, usque adeo ut inde sciri possit de quonam bono agitur, num scilicet de bono spirituali, vel (o)num de bono caelesti; tympana et citharae pertinebant ad classem spiritualium, 
quapropter hic dicitur quoad bonum spirituale; quod `cithara' praedicetur de spiritualibus {1}, et quod per instrumenta chordacea significentur spiritualia, sed per inflatoria caelestia, videatur
