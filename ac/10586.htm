After they had been conjoined with them, they immediately appeared above the head, thus near me, for by means of this conjunction there was effected a consociation of the affections and derivative thoughts 
with the spirits of our earth who were about me; and presence appears according to the consociation in respect to these, as can be seen from what has been said above. They then spoke with me, and 
said that they had there found consociate spirits. </p>

Immediately after they had been linked to these Martian spirits they appeared overhead, thus near me; for by being linked to them they were then brought into association, on the level of affections and 
consequent thoughts, with the spirits belonging to our planet who were round about myself; and it is association on that level that allows another's presence to become apparent, as may be recognized 
from the things stated above. They then spoke to me, saying that they had found spirits there with whom they could mix.  </p>

Postquam illis conjuncti erant, statim apparebant supra caput, ita prope me, nam per conjunctionem cum illis consociatio quoad affectiones et inde cogitationes cum spiritibus nostrae telluris qui circum 
me erant fiebat, et secundum consociationem quoad illas apparet praesentia, ut ex supra dictis constare potest. Loquebantur tunc mecum, et dicebant quod ibi invenerint spiritus consocios. </p>
