<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8018节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8018.</strong>“耶和华将以色列人从埃及地领出来”表主将那些处于真理之良善和良善之真理的人从诅咒中释放出来。这从“领出来”和“埃及地”的含义，以及“以色列人”的代表清楚可知：“领出来”是指释放；“以色列人”是指那些属于属灵教会的人，或也可说，那些处于真理之良善和良善之真理的人，如前所述（参看<a href="7957.htm">7957</a>，<a href="8006.htm">8006</a>节）；“埃及地”是指诅咒。“埃及地”在此之所以表示诅咒，是因为埃及人此时的状态表示诅咒（<a href="7766.htm">7766</a>，<a href="7778.htm">7778</a>节）。主将那些属于属灵教会的人，也就是那些处于真理之良善和良善之真理的人从诅咒中释放出来（参看<a href="6854.htm">6854</a>，<a href="6914.htm">6914</a>，<a href="7091.htm">7091</a>e，<a href="7828.htm">7828</a>，<a href="7932.htm">7932</a>节）。<br />主复活时对他们的释放，由主降到较低的区域（即地狱）来表示，并由死人从坟墓里复活来清楚显明；对此，经上在马太福音如此描述：<br />坟墓也开了。已睡圣徒的身体，多有起来的。到耶稣复活以后，他们从坟墓里出来，进了圣城，向许多人显现。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太27.52.htm">27:52</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太27.53.htm">53</a>）<br />他们从坟墓里出来，进了圣城，向许多人显现，见证了那些至今仍陷在属灵的囚禁之人被主释放，并将被引入天堂。就内义而言，“圣城”表示天堂；这就是为何经上用“圣城”这个词，而事实上，它不是一个神圣的城，而是一个亵渎的城，因为它的百姓如此残忍地对待主自己；殊不知，他们教会的一切宗教仪式都代表主，他们当中的圣言描述的也是主，因此主是他们教会的神。<br />但以理书中的这段经文所表示相同：<br />那时，你百姓当中，凡查到被记录在册上的，必得拯救。那时睡在尘土中的，必有多人复醒，其中有得永生的，有受责备、永远蒙羞的。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但12.1.htm">12:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/但12.2.htm">2</a>）<br />以西结书中的这段经文同样如此：<br />所以你要发预言说，主耶和华如此说：我的子民，看哪，我必开你们的坟墓，使你们从坟墓中出来；我的子民哪，我要领你们进入以色列地，我打开你们的坟墓，使你们从坟墓中出来的时候，你们就知道我是耶和华。我必将我的灵放在你们里面，你们就要活了。我将你们安置在本地，你们就知道我耶和华如此说，也如此成就了。这是耶和华说的。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结37.12.htm">37:12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结37.14.htm">14</a>）<br />“以色列地”，就是迦南地，表示天堂（<a href="8011.htm">8011</a>节）。预言中的这些话描述了人的新造或新生，以及主使那些属于属灵教会的人复活。</p>

That Jehovah led forth the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt. That this signifies that the Lord liberated from damnation those who were in the good of truth and in the truth of good, is evident 
from the signification of "to lead forth," as being to liberate; and from the representation of the sons of Israel, as being those who are of the spiritual church, or what is the same, who are in the 
good of truth and the truth of good (of which above, see n. 7957, 8006); and from the signification of "the land of Egypt," as being damnation. That "the land of Egypt" here denotes damnation, is because 
by the state of the Egyptians is now signified damnation (n. 7766, 7778). (That the Lord liberated from damnation those who were of the spiritual church, that is, who were in the good of truth and 
the truth of good, see n. 6854, 6914, 7091, 7828, 7932.) [2] Their liberation by the Lord when He rose again is signified by the descent of the Lord to the lower regions, and was clearly shown by the 
awakening of the, dead out of the tombs, of which in Matthew: </p>
<p>     And the tombs were opened; and many bodies of the saints that were sleeping were raised; and going forth out of the tombs after His 
resurrection they entered into the holy city and appeared to many (Matt. 27:52-53); </p>
<p>their going forth out of the tombs, and entering into the holy city, and also their appearing, were for a testification 
that they, who had hitherto been detained in spiritual captivity, had been liberated by the Lord, and would be introduced into heaven. In the internal sense heaven is signified by "the holy city;" 
and therefore it is called "the holy city," when yet it was not holy but profane, seeing that its people had so cruelly treated the Lord Himself, who was represented in all the rituals of their church, 
and described in the Word that was among them; and thus who had been the God of their church. [3] The like is signified by this passage in Daniel: </p>
<p>     At that time thy people shall be delivered, 
everyone that shall be found written in the book. And then many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, these to eternal life, but the rest to shame and everlasting disgrace (Dan. 
12:1-2). And also by this in Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Prophesy and say, Thus said the Lord Jehovih, Behold I will open your sepulchers, and cause you to come up out of your sepulchers, O My people; and I will 
bring you upon the land of Israel, that ye may know that I am Jehovah, when I shall open your sepulchers, and shall cause you to come up out of your sepulchers, O My people, and I shall put My spirit 
in you, that ye may live, and I shall place you upon your land, that ye may know that I Jehovah have spoken it, and performed it, said Jehovah (Ezek. 37:12-14); </p>
<p>where by "the land of Israel" or of 
Canaan is meant heaven (n. 8011). By these words in the prophet is described the new creation or generation of man, and also the vivification by the Lord of those who are of the spiritual church. </p>

'That Jehovah brought the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt' means that the Lord delivered those governed by the good of truth and guided by the truth of good from damnation. This is clear 
from the meaning of 'bringing out' as delivering; from the representation of 'the children of Israel' as those belonging to the spiritual Church, or what amounts to the same thing, those governed by the 
good of truth and guided by the truth of good, dealt with above in <a href="7957.htm">7957</a>, <a href="8006.htm">8006</a>; and from the meaning of 'the land of Egypt' as damnation. 'The land of Egypt' at this point means damnation because damnation 
is meant by the Egyptians' state at this time, <a href="7766.htm">7766</a>, <a href="7778.htm">7778</a>. The fact that the Lord delivered from damnation those belonging to the spiritual Church, that is, those governed by the good of truth 
and guided by the truth of good, see <a href="6854.htm">6854</a>, <a href="6914.htm">6914</a>, <a href="7091.htm">7091</a> (end), <a href="7828.htm">7828</a>, <a href="7932.htm">7932</a>. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 Their deliverance by the Lord when He rose again is meant by the Lord's descent to the lower regions (ad inferos);<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> and 
it was made plain by the raising of the dead from their tombs, described in Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
And the tombs were opened, and many bodies of sleeping saints were raised; and coming out of their tombs after 
His resurrection, they went into the holy city and appeared to many. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2027:52,%2053&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 27:52, 53</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Their coming out of tombs, their going into the holy city, and also their appearing to many took place to bear 
witness to the deliverance by the Lord of those who until then had been held back in spiritual captivity, and to the introduction of them into heaven, heaven being meant in the internal sense by 'the 
holy city'. This is why the expression 'the holy city' is used when in actual fact it was not a holy but a profane city, since the Lord Himself - who was represented in all the ritual observances of their 
Church and described in the Word existing among them, and so was the God of their Church - was treated by them in so cruel a manner. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Much the same is meant by this in Daniel, </p>
<blockquote>
At that time 
Your people will be rescued, every one who is found written in the book. Finally, many of those sleeping in the dust of the earth will awake - these to eternal life, but the rest to reproaches and 
to eternal disgrace. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Dan%2012:1,%202&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Dan 12:1, 2</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And also by this in Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
Prophesy and say, Thus said the Lord Jehovah, Behold, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, O My people, 
and I will bring you onto the land of Israel, in order that you may know that I am Jehovah when I open your graves and cause you to come up out of your graves, O My people. And I will put My spirit 
in you, in order that you may live, and I will place you on your own land, in order that you may know that I Jehovah have spoken it and done it, said Jehovah. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2037:11-14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 37:11-14</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The land of Israel', 
which is the land of Canaan, is used to mean heaven, <a href="8011.htm">8011</a>.The words quoted here from the prophet describe the new creation or birth of a person, and also the vivifying by the Lord of those belonging 
to the spiritual Church.

<h4>Notes</h4><small>
<a name="fn1"></a><a href="#fntext1"><sup>a</sup></a> The Latin here is per descensum Domini ad inferos. This appears to be a reference to the Apostles' Creed and the Athanasian Creed, which, in their traditional Latin versions, 
contain the phrase descendit ad inferos (He descended to the lower regions). The traditional English version says He descended into hell. </p>

`Eduxit Jehovah filios Israelis e terra Aegypti': quod significet quod Dominus liberaverit illos qui in bono veri et vero boni a damnatione, constat a significatione `educere' quod sit liberare; ex 
repraesentatione `filiorum Israelis' quod sint qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, seu quod idem, qui in bono veri et in vero boni, de qua supra n. (x)7957, 8006; et ex significatione `terrae Aegypti' quod sit 
damnatio; quod `terra Aegypti' hic sit damnatio, est quia per statum Aegyptiorum nunc significatur damnatio, n. 7766, 7778; quod Dominus a damnatione liberaverit illos qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, hoc 
est, qui in bono veri et vero boni, videatur n. 6854, 6914, 7091 fin., 7828, 7932. 	2 Liberatio illorum a Domino cum resurrexit significatur per descensum Domini ad inferos; ac manifestata est per 
exsuscitationem mortuorum e monumentis, de qua apud Matthaeum, Et monumenta aperta sunt, et multa corpora dormientium sanctorum suscitata sunt, et exeuntes e monumentis suis post resurrectionem Ipsius 
ingressi sunt in sanctam urbem, ac apparuerunt multis, xxvii 52, 53; </p>
<p>`egressio e monumentis,' et `ingressio in sanctam urbem,' tum `apparitio' {1}exstiterunt in testificationem quod a Domino liberati 
sint qui eo usque detenti fuerunt in captivitate spirituali, ac quod introducti in caelum; caelum in sensu interno {2}significatur per `sanctam urbem' {3}; ideo dicitur `sancta urbs' cum tamen non 
sancta sed profana fuit, cum Ipsum Dominum, Qui in omnibus Ecclesiae illorum ritualibus fuit repraesentatus, ac in Verbo apud illos descriptus, (c)et sic Qui Deus Ecclesiae illorum fuerat, tam crudeliter 
tractaverunt. 	3 Simile per hoc significatur apud Danielem, In tempore hoc eripietur populus Tuus, omnis qui invenietur scriptus in libro; denique multi de dormientibus in pulvere terrae evigilabunt, 
hi ad vitam {4}aeternam, reliqui vero in opprobria, in ignominiam {4}aeternam, xii 1, 2: </p>
<p>et quoque per hoc apud Ezechielem, Propheta et dic, Sic dixit Dominus Jehovih, Ecce Ego aperturus sepulcra 
vestra, et ascendere faciam vos e sepulcris vestris, popule Mi, ac deducam vos super terram Israelis, ut cognoscatis quod Ego Jehovah, cum aperuero sepulcra vestra, et ascendere fecero vos e sepulcris 
vestris, popule Mi, et dedero spiritum Meum in vobis, ut vivatis, et collocavero vos super terra vestra, ut cognoscatis quod Ego Jehovah locutus sim, et fecerim, dictum Jehovae, xxxvii 12-14; </p>
<p>per 
`terram Israelis' seu per `terram Canaanem' intelligitur caelum, n. 8011; per haec apud prophetam describitur nova creatio seu {5}generatio hominis; (m)et quoque vivificatio illorum qui ab Ecclesia 
spirituali, a Domino.(n) 	@1 factae sunt$ 	@2 intelligitur$ 	@3 i, in quam ingressi$ 	@4 saeculi$ 	@5 regeneratio$ </p>
