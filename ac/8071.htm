Verses 11-16. And it shall be when Jehovah shall have brought thee into the land of the Canaanite, as He sware to thee and to thy fathers, and shall have given it thee, that thou shalt cause to pass 
over to Jehovah all that openeth the womb; and all that openeth of the offspring of a beast, which shall be to thee males, shall be for Jehovah. And all that openeth of an ass thou shalt redeem with one 
of the flock; and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break its neck: and every firstborn of man among thy sons shalt thou redeem. And it shall be when thy son shall ask thee tomorrow, saying, 
What is this? that thou shalt say, unto him, In strength of hand Jehovah led us forth from Egypt, from the house of servants. And it was that Pharaoh hardened himself against letting us go, and Jehovah 
slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt; from the firstborn of man and even to the firstborn of beast; therefore I sacrifice to Jehovah all that openeth the womb, being males; and all the firstborn 
of thy sons I redeem. And it shall be for a sign upon thine hand, and for frontlets between thine eyes; because in strength of hand Jehovah led us forth out of Egypt. "And it shall be when Jehovah 
shall have brought thee in to the land of the Canaanite," signifies the region of heaven occupied by those who are in evil and falsity; "as He sware to thee and to thy fathers, and shall have given 
it thee," signifies which was promised by the Divine to those who are in good and truth; "that thou shalt cause to pass over to Jehovah all that openeth the womb," signifies that the faith of charity 
which is of regeneration is the Lord's; "and all that openeth of the offspring of a beast," signifies all charity which is of the new begetting; "which shall be to thee, males," signifies which is 
of the truth of faith, "shall be for Jehovah," signifies that it is the Lord's; "and all that openeth of an ass thou shalt redeem with one of the flock," signifies that faith merely natural must not be 
ascribed to the Lord, but the truth of innocence which is therein; "and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break its neck," signifies that if the truth of innocence is not therein, it must 
be separated and cast out; "and every firstborn of man among thy sons thou shalt redeem," signifies that the truths of faith are not to be ascribed to the Lord, but the goods thereof; "and it shall be 
when thy son asketh thee," signifies perception from the truth which is of conscience; "tomorrow," signifies always when this takes place; "saying, What is this?" signifies inquiry why this is so; "that 
thou shalt say unto him," signifies the answer; "In strength of hand Jehovah led us forth from Egypt, from the house of servants," signifies that by the Divine power of the Lord they were liberated 
from spiritual captivity; "and it was that Pharaoh hardened himself against letting us go," signifies when they who were infesting by means of falsities were determined that they should not he liberated; 
"and Jehovah slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt," signifies that all were damned who were in faith separate from charity; "from the firstborn of man and even to the firstborn of beast," 
signifies the falsity of faith separate interior and exterior; "therefore I sacrifice to Jehovah all that openeth the womb, being males," signifies that therefore the faith of charity which is of the 
new begetting must be ascribed to the Lord; "and all the firstborn of my sons I redeem," signifies that the truths of faith are not to be ascribed to the Lord, but the goods of faith; "and it shall be 
for a sign upon thine hand," signifies that it must be constantly in the will; "and for frontlets between thine eyes," signifies that it must be constantly in the understanding; "because in strength 
of hand Jehovah led us forth out of Egypt," signifies that they were liberated by the Lord's Divine power. </p>

Verses 11-16 And it shall be when Jehovah brings you into the land of the Canaanite, as He swore to you and your fathers, and gives it to you, that you shall make over to Jehovah all that open the womb;<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a>

and if you do not redeem it you shall break its neck. And all the firstborn of man among your sons you shall redeem. And it shall be when your son asks you tomorrow, saying, What is this? that you are 
to say to him, By strength of hand Jehovah brought us out of Egypt, out of the house of slaves. And so it was when Pharaoh hardened himself against sending us away, that Jehovah killed all the firstborn 
in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of man even to the firstborn of beast. Therefore I sacrifice to Jehovah all that open the womb, if they are males<A name="fntext4"></a><A href="#fn4"><sup>d</sup></a>; and all the firstborn of my sons I redeem. 
And it shall be as a sign on your hand and as frontlets between your eyes; for by strength of hand Jehovah brought us out of Egypt. </p>
<p>'And it shall be when Jehovah brings you into the land of 
the Canaanite' means the region of heaven occupied by those steeped in evil and falsity. 'As He swore to you and your fathers, and gives it to you' means which the Divine promised to those governed by 
goodness and truth. 'That you shall make over to Jehovah all that open the womb' means that faith springing from charity, which comes with regeneration, is the Lord's. 'And all offspring opening it among 
the beasts' means all charity belonging to the new birth. 'Which you will have, if they are males' means which is intrinsically the truth of faith. 'Shall be for Jehovah' means that it is the Lord's. 
'And all that open it among the asses you shall redeem with a member of the flock' means that merely natural faith must not be ascribed to the Lord, but the truth of innocence present within it. </p>
<p>'And 
if you do not redeem it you shall break its neck' means that if the truth of innocence is not present within it, it is to be separated and cast aside. 'And all the firstborn of man among your 
sons you shall redeem' means that the truths of faith are not to be ascribed to the Lord, but forms of the good of faith. 'And it shall be when your son asks you' means perception springing from truth 
that belongs to conscience. 'Tomorrow' means always when this takes place. 'What is this?' means enquiry why it is so. 'That you are to say to him' means the reply. 'By strength of hand Jehovah brought 
us out of Egypt, out of the house of slaves' means that by the Lord's Divine power they were delivered from spiritual captivity. 'And so it was when Pharaoh hardened himself against sending us away' 
means when those who molested by means of falsities were obstinately determined not to let them be released. 'That Jehovah killed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt' means that all governed by faith 
separated from charity were damned. 'From the firstborn of man even to the firstborn of beast' means the falsity, interior and exterior, belonging to separated faith. 'Therefore I sacrifice to Jehovah 
all that open the womb, if they are males' means that therefore the faith springing from charity, which belongs to the new birth, is to be ascribed to the Lord. 'And all the firstborn of my sons 
I redeem' means that the truths of faith are not to be ascribed to the Lord, but forms of the good of faith. 'And it shall be as a sign on your hand' means that it shall be constantly in the will. 'And 
as frontlets between the eyes' means that it shall be constantly in the understanding. 'For by strength of hand Jehovah brought us out of Egypt' means that they were delivered by the Lord's Divine 
power.

Vers. 11-16.  Et erit cum introduxerit te Jehovah ad terram Cananaei, quemadmodum juravit tibi et patribus tuis, et dederit illam tibi.  Et transire facies omnem aperturam uteri Jehovae, et omnem aperturam 
fetus bestiae, qui erit tibi masculi, Jehovae.  Et omnem aperturam asini redimes in pecude, et si non redimis, et decollabis illud; et omnem primogenitum hominis in filiis tuis redimes.  Et erit 
quod (x)interroget te filius tuus cras, dicendo, Quid hoc? et dicas ad illum, In robore manus eduxit nos Jehovah ex Aegypto, e domo servorum.  Et erat quod induraverit Pharao ad dimittendum nos, et 
interfecit Jehovah omne primogenitum in terra Aegypti, a primogenito hominis et usque ad primogenitum bestiae, propterea ego sacrifico Jehovae omnem aperturam uteri, masculos, et omnem primogenitum filiorum 
meorum redimo.  Et erit in signum super manu tua, et ad frontalia inter oculos tuos, quia in robore manus eduxit nos Jehovah ex Aegypto.  `Et erit cum introduxerit te Jehovah ad terram Cananaei' 
significat regionem caeli occupatam ab illis qui in malo et falso: `quemadmodum juravit tibi et patribus tuis, et dederit illam tibi' significat quae ex Divino promissa illis qui in bono et vero: `et 
transire facies omnem aperturam uteri Jehovae' significat fidem charitatis, quae regenerationis, quod Domini: `et omnem aperturam fetus bestiae' significat omnem charitatem quae novae generationis: 
`qui erit tibi masculi' significat quae veri fidei: `Jehovae' significat quod Domini sit: {1}`et omnem aperturam asini redimes in pecude' significat quod fides mere naturalis non addicabitur Domino, 
sed verum innocentiae quod inibi: `et si non redimis, et decollabis illud' significat si non inibi {2}verum innocentiae, quod separanda et ejicienda: et omnem primogenitum hominis in filiis tuis redimes' 
significat quod vera fidei non addicanda sint Domino, sed bona ejus: `et erit quod interroget te filius tuus' significat {3}perceptionem ex vero quod conscientiae: `cras' significat semper cum fit: 
`Quid hoc?' significat inquisitionem cur ita: `et dicas ad illum' significat responsum: `In robore manus eduxit nos Jehovah ex Aegypto, e domo servorum' significat quod ex Divina (t)Domini potentia 
liberati sint e (x)captivitate spirituali: `et erat quod induraverit Pharao ad dimittendum nos' significat cum obstinarent se qui per falsa infestabant, ne liberarentur: `et interfecit Jehovah omnem primogenitum 
in terra Aegypti' significat quod damnati omnes qui in fide separata a charitate: `a primogenito hominis et usque ad primogenitum bestiae' significat falsum fidei (x)separatae interius et 
exterius: `propterea ego sacrifico Jehovae omnem aperturam uteri, masculos' significat quod ideo addicanda Domino fides charitatis, quae novae generationis: `et omnem primogenitum filiorum meorum redimo' 
significat quod vera fidei non (t)addicanda sint Domino, sed bona ejus: `et erit in signum super manu [tua]' significat quod erit perpetuo in voluntate: `et ad frontalia inter oculos' significat quod 
perpetuo in intellectu: `quia in robore manus eduxit nos Jehovah de Aegypto' significat {4}quod ex Divina potentia Domini liberati sint. 	@1 In the Expositio Communis (A iii, p. 427) all of v 13 
is d.  It read: Et omnem aperturam asini redimes in pecude, significat scientifica mere naturalia quae homini cum e novo natus, quod adjungantur per verum spirituale: et si non redimis et decollabis illud, 
significat si non adjunguntur, quod separabuntur et ejicientur: et omnem primogenitum hominis in filiis tuis redimes, significat quod verum boni seu fides charitatis, quae homini cum e novo natus 
est, ei appropriabitur.  There is no rewriting, but a marginal note in Swedish indicates the intended procedure: I stelle for detta tages utur texten (in place of this transfer from the text).  In n. 
8078 the signification is given thus, but d and i that of I. n. 8079 and n. 8080 are as I without previous attempts or deletions.$ 	@2 bonum I$ 	@3 cogitationem ex vero fidei$ 	@4 quod Dominus ex 
Divina potentia liberaverit illos qui in vero boni  A also had this in n. 8090 but is altered to agree with I.$ </p>
