<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6876节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6876.</strong>“对他们说，你们祖宗的神差我到你们这里来”表古教会的神将与那些属于属灵教会的人同在。这从“他们祖宗的神”和“差”的含义，以及以色列人的代表清楚可知：“他们祖宗的神”是指古教会的神，“祖宗”是指那些属于古教会的人（参看<a href="6050.htm">6050</a>，<a href="6075.htm">6075</a>，<a href="6846.htm">6846</a>节）；以色列人，即此处的“你们”，是指那些属于属灵教会的人（参看<a href="6875.htm">6875</a>节）； “差”是指发出（<a href="2397.htm">2397</a>，<a href="4710.htm">4710</a>，<a href="6831.htm">6831</a>节），在此是指祂将与他们同在的应许，因为这是在谈论古教会的神，即祂应许祂将在以色列人所代表的属灵教会中。<br />古教会的神是神性人身方面的主；古教会从上古教会，以及以下事实获得对神的这种觉知：每当耶和华显现时，祂都是以人的形式显现。所以当思想耶和华时，他们不会把祂作为一个普遍实体，或存在于各处一切事物中的存在来思想，他们对这样的普遍实体或存在没有任何概念。相反，他们把祂作为一个神性的人，或一个神性位格来思想，这样他们就能把思维集中到祂身上。因为以这种方式他们就能思想耶和华，并在爱中与祂联结。那些属于古教会的人，尤其那些属于上古教会的人，远远比我们这个时代的人智慧得多；然而，他们只能以其人身为神性的一个人来思想耶和华，无法以其它任何方式来思想祂。也没有任何不得体的欲望，就是取自属世人，以及属世人的瑕疵和邪恶的观念进入他们的思维。相反，所流入的关于祂的观念完全是神圣的。智慧远远胜过世人的天使本身也无法以其它任何方式思想神性，因为他们在神性人身中看见主。他们知道，对一位所有事物都是有限的天使来说，若不通过类似有限之物，他就无法对无限形成任何观念。<br />在古时，人们以一位神性人或神性位格的形式崇拜耶和华；这一事实从以人的形式向亚伯拉罕，后来向罗得，以及向约书亚、基甸和玛挪亚显现的天使很清楚地看出来。这些天使被称为“耶和华”，并被崇拜为宇宙之神。如今，如果耶和华真的作为一个人出现在教会，人们就会进行冒犯认为祂绝不是宇宙的创造者和主，因为他们所看见的，是一个人。此外，他们除了把祂当作一个平凡人来思想外，对祂也没有其它任何观念。如今，以这种方式思考的人自以为比古人更有智慧；殊不知，以这种方式进行思考，他们就完全远离了智慧。因为当人的思维观念指向一个完全不可理解的普遍实体，或无处不在的存在时，这种观念就会落入虚假，完全消散。然后，关于自然界的观念取而代之；于是，每一个事物都被归于自然界。这就是为何当今自然崇拜如此普遍，在基督教界尤为普遍。</p>

And say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you. That this signifies that the Divine of the Ancient Church will be with those of the spiritual church is evident from the signification 
of the "God of their fathers" as being the Divine of the Ancient Church (that "fathers" denote those who are of the Ancient Church, see n. 6050, 6075, 6846); from the representation of the sons of Israel, 
here meant by "you" as being those of the spiritual church (see n. 6875); and from the signification of "being sent" as being to proceed (n. 2397, 4710, 6831); here that he will be with them, for 
it is said of the Divine of the Ancient Church that this shall be in the spiritual church, which is represented by the sons of Israel. [2] The Divine which was of the Ancient Church was the Lord as 
to the Divine Human; the Ancient Church had this from the Most Ancient, and also from the fact that Jehovah was seen by them in a human form. When therefore they thought of Jehovah, they did not think 
of a universal entity, of which they could have had no idea, but of the Human Divine, into which they could determine their thought; for in this way they could both think of Jehovah and be conjoined 
with Him by love. Those who were of the Ancient Church, and especially those of the Most Ancient, were much wiser than the men of our times, and yet they could not think otherwise of Jehovah than as 
of a Man, whose Human was Divine; nor did there then flow into their thought any unbecoming idea taken from the natural man, and his infirmity and evil, but that which flowed in concerning Him was all 
holy. The angels themselves, who so far excel men in wisdom, cannot think otherwise of the Divine, for they see the Lord in the Divine Human; they know that an angel, with whom all things are finite, 
can have no idea whatever of the Infinite, except by what is like the finite. [3] That in ancient times they adored Jehovah under a human Divine is very evident from the angels seen by Abraham in human 
form, also afterward by Lot, and likewise by Joshua, by Gideon, and by Manoah, which angels were called "Jehovah," and were adored as the God of the universe. At this day if Jehovah were to appear 
in the church as a man, men would take offence, and would think that He could not possibly be the Creator and Lord of the universe, because he was seen as a man; and moreover they would not have any 
other idea of Him than as of a common man. In this they believe themselves wiser than the ancients, not knowing that in this they are altogether removed from wisdom; for when the idea of the thought 
is directed to a universal entity altogether incomprehensible, the idea falls into nothing, and is totally dissipated; and then in its place comes the idea of nature, to which each and all things are 
attributed. Hence the worship of nature is at this day so common, especially in the Christian world. </p>

'And saying to them, The God of your fathers has sent me to you' means that He who was the God of the Ancient Church will be with those belonging to the spiritual Church. This is clear from the meaning 
of 'the God of your fathers' as Him who was the God of the Ancient Church, 'fathers' being those who belonged to the Ancient Church, see <a href="6050.htm">6050</a>, <a href="6075.htm">6075</a>, <a href="6846.htm">6846</a>; from the representation of the children of 
Israel, to whom 'you' refers here, as those who belong to the spiritual Church, dealt with immediately above in <a href="6875.htm">6875</a>; and from the meaning of 'being sent' as going forth, dealt with in <a href="2397.htm">2397</a>, <a href="4710.htm">4710</a>, <a href="6831.htm">6831</a>, 
here as the promise that He will be with them, for it is talking about Him who was the God of the Ancient Church, promising that He will be in the spiritual Church, which is represented by the children 
of Israel. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 The God of the Ancient Church was the Lord in respect of His Divine Human. The Ancient Church acquired this perception of God from the Most Ancient Church and also from the consideration 
that whenever Jehovah appeared to them He did so in a human form. When therefore they thought about Jehovah they did not think of Him as the Being present in all things everywhere, of whom 
they would have had no conception. Rather, they thought of Him as a Person who was Divine, on whom they would then be able to focus their thought. For in this way they were able both to think about Jehovah 
and to be joined to Him in love. Those who belonged to the Ancient Church, and especially those who belonged to the Most Ancient Church, were far wiser than people are in our own day, and yet they 
could not think of Jehovah in any other way than as a person whose Humanity was Divine. Nor did their thinking have any Unseemly desires entering it - ideas taken from the natural man, from what is 
imperfect and bad there. Rather the ideas about Him were altogether holy. The angels themselves, whose wisdom is so much greater than man's, cannot think of the Divine in any other way either, for they 
see the Lord in His Divine Human. They know that an angel, with whom all things are finite, cannot begin to form any idea of the Infinite except through what bears resemblance to the finite. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
The fact that people in ancient times venerated Jehovah under the form of a Person who was Divine is perfectly clear from the angels who appeared in human form to Abraham, and also after that to Lot, 
as well as to Joshua, and to Gideon and Manoah. Those angels were called Jehovah and were venerated as the God of all things. If at the present day Jehovah were to appear in the Church as a person people 
would be offended and would think that because what they saw was a person He could not by any means be the Creator and Lord of the Universe. Furthermore they would not then have any other kind of 
idea about Him than what they have about an ordinary human being. Thinking in this way people at the present day believe that they are wiser than the ancients, unaware of the fact that by thinking in 
that way they are completely out of touch with wisdom. For when one's mental resources are spent on envisaging the completely incomprehensible Being present everywhere, they can discern nothing and are 
squandered. And ideas about nature, to which every single thing is attributed, arise instead. This is why nature-worship is so common at the present day, especially in the Christian world. </p>

`Et dico ad illos, Deus patrum vestrorum misit me ad vos': quod significet quod Divinum Ecclesiae Antiquae apud illos qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, erit, constat ex significatione `Dei patrum' quod sit 
Divinum Ecclesiae Antiquae; quod `patres' sint illi qui ab Ecclesia Antiqua, videatur n. 6050, 6075, 6846; ex repraesentatione `filiorum Israelis,' qui hic sunt `vos,' quod sint qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, 
de qua mox supra n. 6875; et ex significatione `mitti' quod sit procedere, de qua n. 2397, 4710, 6831, hic quod erit apud illos, nam dicitur de Divino Ecclesiae Antiquae {1}quod Hoc erit in Ecclesia 
spirituali, quae per filios Israelis repraesentatur. 	2 Divinum quod fuit Ecclesiae Antiquae fuit Dominus quoad Divinum Humanum; {2}Antiqua Ecclesia hoc habuit' ab Antiquissima; et quoque ex eo 
quod Jehovah illis visus fuerit in forma humana; quapropter cum de Jehovah cogitabant, non cogitabant ut de Ente universali cujus nullam ideam {3}habuissent, sed ut de Humano Divino, in quod determinare 
cogitationem suam possent; sic enim et cogitare de Jehovah et conjungi Ipsi amore potuerunt; qui ab {4} Ecclesia Antiqua fuerunt, et imprimis qui ab Ecclesia Antiquissima, multo sapientiores fuerunt 
nostratibus, et tamen usque non cogitare potuerunt aliter de Jehovah quam ut de Homine cujus Humanum Divinum esset {5}; nec tunc in cogitationem illorum influebat aliquod indecens captum ex homine 
naturali ejusque infirmo et malo, sed quod de Illo influebat erat omne sanctum; (m)ipsi angeli, qui in tanta sapientia sunt prae homine, nec aliter possunt cogitare de Divino, vident enim Dominum in 
Divino Humano; {6}sciunt quod angelus, apud quem omnia finita sunt, nequaquam aliquam ideam habere possit de Infinito, nisi per simile finito'.(n) 	3 Quod {7}antiquis temporibus Jehovam adoraverint sub 
Humano Divino, constat manifeste ab angelis visis Abrahamo in forma humana, tum dein Lotho, ut et Josuae, atque Guideoni et Manoacho, qui angeli vocati sunt Jehovah, ac ut Deus universi adorati.  Hodie 
si Jehovah appareret in Ecclesia sicut homo, scandalizarentur, et cogitarent quod nequaquam Creator et Dominus universi {8}esset quia visus ut homo; ac praeterea non aliam haberent de Ipso ideam 
quam qualem de vulgari homine; credunt se in hoc sapientiores antiquis, non scientes quod in eo sint a sapientia prorsus remoti; nam cum in Ens universale prorsus incomprehensibile effunditur cogitationis 
idea, cadit idea in nullum et prorsus dissipatur; et tunc loco ejus venit idea naturae, cui omnia et singula tribuuntur; inde naturae cultus in orbe imprimis Christiano hodie tam communis est. 	@1
