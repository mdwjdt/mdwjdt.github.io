<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1828节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1828.</strong>创世记15:10. 亚伯兰就把这些都取来，每样从中间劈成两半，一半对着另一半摆列，只有鸟没有劈开。<br />“亚伯兰就把这些都取来”表事就这样成了。“每样从中间劈成两半”表教会和主。“一半对着另一半摆列”表属天事物的平行和对应。“只有鸟没有劈开”表属灵事物没有这种平行和对应。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1828.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1828/bible_king-james-version_genesis_15_10" target=_top>Genesis 15:10</a>. And he took himself all these things and split them in half and set each of the parts across from its other [half]; but the fowl he did not split.<br />He took himself all these things means it was done. And split them in half symbolizes the church and the Lord. And set each of the parts across from its other [half] symbolizes parallelism and correspondence regarding heavenly things. But the fowl he did not split means that spiritual things lack this symmetry and correspondence. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1828</b></p><p><b>1828.</b>
Verse 10. And he took unto him all these and divided them in the midst, and laid each part over against the other; and the birds he did not divide. "He took unto him all these," signifies that it was 
so done; "and divided them in the midst," signifies the church and the Lord; "and laid each part over against the other," signifies a parallelism and correspondence as to celestial things; "and the birds 
he did not divide," signifies spiritual things, wherein there was not such parallelism and correspondence. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1828</b></p><p><b>1828.</b>
Verse 10 And he took for himself all these, and parted each of them down the middle and laid each part opposite the other; but the birds he did not cut apart. </p>
<p>'And he took for himself all these' means 
this was carried out. 'And he divided them down the middle' means the Church and the Lord. 'And he laid each part opposite the other' means a parallelism and correspondence as regards celestial things. 
'But the birds he did not divide' means that no such parallelism and correspondence existed in the case of spiritual things. </p>

</p><b>1828.</b>
Vers. 10.  Et accepit sibi omnia illa, et partitus est illa in medium, et dedit quamvis partem suam obviam alteri, et volucrem non partitus. 'Accepit sibi omnia illa' significat ita factum: 'et partitus 
illa in medium' significat Ecclesiam et Dominum: 'et dedit quamvis partem suam obviam alteri' significat parallelismum et correspondentiam quoad caelestia: 'et volucrem non partitus' significat spiritualia 
quod talis non parallelismus et correspondentia. </p>
