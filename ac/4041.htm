<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4041节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4041.</strong>天堂的形式简直不可思议，完全超出人类的所有智慧；因为它远在任何人从世俗事物，甚至借助分析所能获得的对形式的概念之上。所有天堂的社群都照着该形式而被有序排列；说来奇怪，一种涉及这些形式的旋转运动正在进行，而天使和灵人却对这种运动没有任何实际的感觉。这就像地球每日绕轴自转，每年绕太阳公转，而地球上的人却对此毫无觉察一样。该天堂形式在最低层领域的性质曾向我显明。它就像人脑中可见曲线所具有的形式。我蒙允许清楚看到这些弯曲或蜿蜒的交叠，并且一连观察了好几天。我由此可以保证说，脑是照着天堂流动的形式而形成的。不过，其中眼所看不到的内部事物则与天堂的内部形式一致，而这些形式完全无法理解。天使还告诉我，由此可以看出，人是照着三层天堂的形式被造的；天堂的形式以这种方式被铭刻在他身上，以致人就是最小形式的小天堂；并且这就是他与诸天堂对应的起源。</p>

The heavenly form is amazing, and quite surpasses all human intelligence; for it is far above the ideas of the forms that a man can possibly conceive of from worldly things, even with the aid of analysis. 
All the heavenly societies are arranged in order in accordance with this form, and wonderful to say there is a gyration according to these forms, of which angels and spirits are not sensible. This 
is like the daily movement of the earth round its axis, and its annual movement round the sun, which its inhabitants do not perceive. It has been shown me of what nature is this heavenly form in the 
lowest sphere; it was like the form of the circumvolutions seen in the human brains. This flow (that is, these gyrations) it was given me perceptibly to see, and this continuously for several days; 
and in this way I was assured that the brain is formed in accordance with the form of the flow of heaven. But the interior things therein, which do not appear to the eye, are in accordance with the interior 
forms of heaven, which are quite incomprehensible; and I was told by the angels that from this it can be seen that man has been created according to the forms of the three heavens; and that in 
this way the image of heaven has been impressed upon him, so that man is a little heaven in the least form; and that this is the source of his correspondence with the heavens. </p>

The heavenly form is amazing, completely surpassing all human intelligence, for it is far beyond and above the ideas of forms which anyone can possibly gain from worldly things, even with the help of 
analytical arguments. In accordance with this form all the heavenly communities are arranged in their proper order; and what is remarkable, a rotatory movement involving those forms is taking place - 
a movement of which angels and spirits do not have any actual sensation. It is like the progress of the earth, spinning daily on its axis and orbiting yearly around the sun, which is not perceptible 
to its inhabitants. I have been shown the nature of the heavenly form as it exists in the lowest sphere. It was like the form taken by the sinuous curvings which are visible in the human brain. This curving 
round or sinuous overlapping I was allowed to observe clearly, and to do so for several days. From this I was able to be shown that the brain has been formed in accordance with the flowing movement 
belonging to heaven. But the interior parts of it which are not visible to the eye accord with the interior forms of heaven, which are quite beyond comprehension. I was also told by angels that from 
this one can see that the human being has been created according to the forms which the three heavens take, and that in this way the image of heaven has been imprinted on him, so much so that the 
human being is in form a very small-scale heaven and that this is the origin of his correspondence with the heavens. </p>

</p><b>4041.</b>
Forma caelestis est stupenda, et prorsus excedit omnem intelligentiam humanam, est enim longe supra ideas formarum quas homo ex mundanis, etiam per analytica, usquam capere potest; </p>
<p>secundum illam 
formam sunt omnes societates caelestes ordinatae, et quod mirum, est gyratio secundum formas, quam nempe gyrationem, angeli et spiritus non sentiunt; se habet hoc sicut fluxus telluris circum axem 
quotidie, et circum solem quotannis, quem incolae non appercipiunt: mihi ostensum est qualis forma caelestis est in sphaera intima; erat qualis forma circumvolutionum quae apparent in cerebris humanis; 
fluxum illum seu gyrationes illas perceptibiliter mihi videre dabatur; hoc perstabat per aliquot dies: inde constare mihi potuit quod cerebrum formatum sit secundum formam fluxionis caeli; sed 
quae interiora ibi sunt, et quae non apparent ad oculum, sunt secundum formas interiores caeli, quae prorsus incomprehensibiles sunt; et dictum ab angelis, quod inde videri possit quod homo secundum 
formas trium caelorum creatus sit, et quod sic ei impressa sit imago caeli, adeo ut homo sit in minima forma parvulum caelum, et quod inde correspondentia ejus cum caelis. </p>
