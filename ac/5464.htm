<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5464节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5464.</strong>“好证实你们的话”表在这种情况下，这些真理就如它们被宣称的那样。这是显而易见的，无需解释。至于他们，即兄弟对于自己，因而对他们所代表的教会真理宣称了什么，可参看前文（<a href="5434.htm">5434</a>-<a href="5444.htm">5444</a>节）。此中情形是这样：纯粹为物质利益而对教会真理感兴趣的人能和其他人一样宣称真理是什么情况。例如，他们能和其他人一样宣称：真理不会变成人自己的，除非它们与内层人联结，甚至宣称它们若不通过良善，就无法如此联结；还宣称在这一切成就之前，真理没有生命。有时他们看待和类似的事，就跟其他人一模一样；有时他们的洞察力甚至比别人的更好；然而，这种情形只在他们与其他人谈论这些事时才会出现。当对着自己，因而对着他们的内层人说这些事时，那些纯粹为自己的利益而对教会真理感兴趣的人就会思想或注视与这些真理相反的观念。但是，他们即便思想或注视这类相反的观念，并且从心里不肯接受这些真理，却仍能说服别人相信事情是真的，事实上和那些真正对真理感兴趣的人一样。<br />为自己获取物质利益、地位和名声的欲望会采取各种能用来说服别人的手段；它最容易采取诸如本质上真实的那类事物；因为这些藏有吸引人们心智的能力在里面。每个人，无论是谁，只要不是智力上有缺陷，都会被赋予理解事情是不是真的这种能力，以便他能通过其心智的理解力部分得以改造和重生。但是，他一旦偏离走上邪路，完全抛弃了构成教会信仰的事物，那么虽仍有理解真理的能力，却不再有理解它们的任何愿望，并且一听见它们就厌恶。</p>

And your words shall be verified. That this signifies that then it will be with truths as had been declared, is evident without explication. What they had declared about themselves, and consequently 
about the truths of the church which they represented, may be seen above (n. 5434-5444). The case herein is that they who are in the truths of the church merely for the sake of their own advantage, can, 
equally with others, declare how the case is with truths, as for example that truths are not appropriated to anyone unless they are conjoined with the interior man, nay, that they cannot be conjoined 
therewith except by means of good, and that until this is done truths have no life. These and like things they sometimes see equally as well as others, and sometimes apparently more clearly than others; 
but this is only when they are talking about them. But when they are speaking to themselves, thus to their interior man (that is, when they are thinking), then they who are in the truths of the 
church merely for the sake of their own advantage see the contrary; and though they see the contrary and at heart deny truths, they can nevertheless persuade others that the case is so, and even that 
they themselves are in this way in truths. The cupidity of gain, honor, and reputation for their own sake, imbibes all means of persuading, and none more readily than such things as in themselves are 
true; for these have within them a hidden power of attracting minds. Every man whatever, unless densely stupid, is endowed with the capacity to understand whether things are true, to the end that by means 
of the intellectual part he may be reformed and regenerated. But when he has wandered into perverse ways, and has completely rejected the things of the faith of the church, he then indeed has the 
same faculty of understanding truths, but no longer desires to understand them, being averse to them as soon as he hears them. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5464</b></p><p><b>5464.</b>
'And your words will be verified' means that in this case those truths will be exactly as they have been declared to be. This becomes clear without explanation. For what the brothers, and consequently 
what the truths known to the Church represented by those brothers, declared themselves to be, see above in <a href="5434.htm">5434</a>-<a href="5456.htm">5456</a>. The implications of all this are as follows: People who are interested in the truths 
known to the Church solely for the sake of material gain can declare, just as well as others do, what the situation is with regard to truths. They can just as well declare, for example, that truths 
do not become a person's own unless they have been joined to the interior man, and indeed that they cannot be so joined except by means of good, and also that truths do not possess any life until this 
is done. At times they see these matters and others like them just as well as anyone else does, and sometimes their discernment of them seems even better. Yet this is so only when they talk to other 
people about such matters. When they talk to themselves about them, thus to their interior man - when, that is, they think about those matters - those who are interested in the truths known to the 
Church merely for the sake of their own gain contemplate ideas contrary to those truths. But even though they contemplate such contrary ideas and refuse in their hearts to accept those truths, they are 
still able to convince others that a thing is true, and indeed to do so in the same way as those who really are interested in truths. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The desire to earn material gain, position, and reputation 
for their own sakes adopts every means that can be employed to convince another; it adopts nothing more readily than such things as are essentially true since these have the power hidden within them 
to attract people's minds. Everyone - no matter who, provided that he is not mentally deficient - is endowed with such an ability, that is to say, the ability to understand whether things are true. He 
has been endowed with it to enable him to be reformed and regenerated through the understanding part of his mind. But although, once he has departed into wicked ways and has cast aside altogether what 
constitutes the faith of the Church, he still possesses the same ability to understand truths, he no longer has any wish to understand them and loathes them the moment he hears them. </p>

`Et verificabuntur verba vestra': quod significet quod tunc erit cum veris sicut pronuntiatum est, constare potest absque explicatione; quomodo illi pronuntiarunt de se, consequenter de Ecclesiae veris 
quae repraesentabant, videatur supra n. 5434-5456. Cum hoc ita se habet: qui in veris Ecclesiae modo sunt propter lucrum, illi aeque ac alii possunt pronuntiare quomodo se habet cum veris, {1}ut, 
pro exemplo, quod vera non approprientur alicui nisi conjuncta sint cum interiore homine, immo quod ei non conjungi queant nisi per bonum, tum quod non prius sit vita veris; haec {2}et similia quandoque 
vident illi peraeque ac alii, et quandoque ad apparentiam perspicacius, sed {3}modo tunc quando de illis cum aliis loquuntur; quando autem loquuntur secum, ita cum interiore suo homine, {4}hoc est, 
cum cogitant, tunc illi qui in veris Ecclesiae sunt modo propter lucrum, vident contraria, et tametsi vident contraria et corde vera negant, usque persuadere possunt aliis quod ita se res habeat, immo 
quod ipsi taliter in veris sint; [2]cupiditas lucri, honoris et famae propter illa, haurit omnia media persuadendi et nihil lubentius quam talia quae in se vera sunt, haec enim absconditam in se vim 
attrahendi animos habent; tali facultate, nempe facultate {5}intelligendi num vera sint, praeditus est homo, qualiscumque sit, {6}modo non fatue stupidus, ex causa ut per intellectualem partem possit 
reformari et regenerari; sed cum in perversa abivit et prorsus illa quae fidei Ecclesiae sunt, {7} rejecit, tunc quidem in simili facultate intelligendi vera est sed non amplius vult intelligere illa, 
aversatur illa ad primam auditionem.   @1 quod nempe$ @2 enim$ @3 hoc$ @4 seu$ @5 A d appercipiendi i intelligendi$ @6 si$ @7 i a se$ </p>
