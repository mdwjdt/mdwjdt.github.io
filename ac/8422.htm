<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8422节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8422.</strong>“他们要把所收进来的预备好了”表对已吸收良善的有序整理。这从“预备”和“所收进来的”的含义清楚可知：“预备”当论及已吸收的良善时，是指有序整理；“所收进来的”当论及表示良善的“吗哪”，是指已吸收的良善。每天收集吗哪表示领受良善，吃吗哪表示吸收；因此，“把所收进来的预备好了”表示有序整理一切已吸收的良善。这种有序整理在“第六天”所表示的每个状态结束时由主完成的。随着这种有序整理而来的是一种联结，这种联结由“第七天”来表示。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 8422</b></p><p><b>8422.</b>
That they shall prepare that which they have brought. That this signifies the disposal of the appropriated goods, is evident from the signification of "preparing," when said of goods that have been appropriated, 
as being disposal; and from the signification of "that which they have brought," when the manna is meant by which good is signified, as being the goods which have been appropriated. The gathering 
of the manna every day signifies the reception of good, and the eating of it signifies appropriation, consequently "to prepare that which they have brought" signifies the disposal of the goods 
which have been appropriated. This disposal is effected by the Lord at the end of every state, which is signified by "the sixth day." Conjunction follows this disposal, and this conjunction is signified 
by "the seventh day." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8422</b></p><p><b>8422.</b>
'That they are to prepare what they have brought in' means setting in order forms of good that have been assimilated. This is clear from the meaning of 'preparing', when it refers to forms of good that 
have been assimilated, as setting in order; and from the meaning of 'what they have brought in' when this refers to 'the manna', by which good is meant - as forms of good that have been assimilated. 
The gathering of the manna every day means the reception of good, and the eating of it means assimilation; therefore 'preparing what they have brought in' means setting in order all the good that has 
been assimilated. That setting in order is carried out by the Lord at the end of every state, which is meant by 'the sixth day'; and it is followed by a joining together, which is meant by 'the seventh day'. </p>

</p><b>8422.</b>
`Et praeparent quod adduxerunt': quod significet dispositionem bonorum appropriatorum, constat ex significatione `praeparare' cum dicitur de bonis appropriatis, quod sit dispositio, et ex significatione 
`quod adduxerunt' {1}cum intelligitur manna, per quam significatur bonum, quod sint bona quae appropriata; collectio mannae quovis {2}die significat boni receptionem, et ejus {3}esus appropriationem, 
inde `praeparare quod adduxerunt' significat dispositionem bonorum appropriatorum; dispositio illa a Domino fit in cujusvis status fine, qui significatur per `diem sextum'; dispositionem illam sequitur 
conjunctio, quae significatur per `diem septimum.' 	@1 dum$ 	@2 mane$ 	@3 commesio (comesus or comestio intended)$ </p>
