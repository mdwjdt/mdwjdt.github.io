<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5907节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5907.</strong>“对他说，你儿子约瑟这样说”表该良善对内在属天层的觉知。这从“说”的含义和“约瑟”的代表清楚可知：在圣言的历史中，“说”是指觉知或觉察，如前面频繁所述；“约瑟”是指内在属天层（参看<a href="5869.htm">5869</a>，<a href="5877.htm">5877</a>节）。此处之所以表示属灵良善，即“以色列”对内在属天层，即“约瑟”，是因为“你儿子约瑟说”在内义上描述了一种觉知或觉察的能力，这种能力是从内在属天层进入属灵良善的流注的产物。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5907</b></p><p><b>5907.</b>
And say unto him, Thus hath said thy son Joseph. That this signifies the perception thereof about the internal celestial, is evident from the signification of "saying" in the historicals of the Word, 
as being perception (of which frequently above); and from the representation of Joseph, as being the internal celestial (see n. 5869, 5877). That there is signified the perception of spiritual good, 
which is "Israel," about the internal celestial, which is "Joseph," is because "hath said thy son Joseph" in the internal sense is the perceptivity of the influx from the internal celestial into spiritual good. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5907</b></p><p><b>5907.</b>
'And say to him, Thus said your son Joseph' means the perception this good had regarding the internal celestial. This is clear from the meaning of 'saying' in the historical narratives of the Word as 
perception, dealt with often; and from the representation of 'Joseph' as the internal celestial, dealt with in <a href="5869.htm">5869</a>, <a href="5877.htm">5877</a>. The reason for the meaning here - the perception that spiritual good, which 
is 'Israel', had regarding the internal celestial, which is 'Joseph' - is that the words 'said your son Joseph' describe in the internal sense an ability to perceive that is the product of an influx from 
the internal celestial into spiritual good.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 5907</b>
</p><b>5907.</b>
`Et dicatis ad illum, Ita dixit filius tuus Joseph': quod significet perceptionem illius de caelesti interno, constat ex significatione `dicere' in historicis Verbi quod sit perceptio, de qua saepius; 
et ex repraesentatione `Josephi' quod sit caeleste internum, de qua n. 5869, 5877; quod significetur perceptio boni spiritualis quod `Israel', de caelesti interno quod `Joseph', {1}est quia `dixit 
filius tuus'. `Joseph in sensu interno est perceptivum influxus a caelesti interno in bonum spirituale. @1 In I this passage is obscure and contradictory. A has no stop between tuus and Joseph, and perceptionis 
instead of perceptivum. It is suggested that the full stop after tuus should be deleted and the four words dixit filius tuus Joseph put in inverted commas, as usual with quotations from the 
Word. A's perceptionis is easily, misread as perceptivum. If that were the case with the final draft, it would yield perceptionis influxus, and it is perceptio that is signified. It happens that influxus 
is both nominative and genitive, and thus serves for either reading--'the perceptive of influx' or `the influx of perception'. But see 5743 and 6063.$ </p>
