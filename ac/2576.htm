<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2576节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2576.</strong>“看哪，这要给你在与你一起的所有人面前作遮眼的”表理性真理对属灵真理来说就象一个遮盖物或一件衣裳。这从“遮”、“眼”和“看”的含义清楚可知：“遮”的含义稍后会予以论述；“眼”是指理解力之物，这从圣言中的众多经文看出来；“看”是指理解（<a href="2150.htm">2150</a>，<a href="2325.htm">2325</a>节）。谁都能看出，本节的每个细节都有若非通过某种内义就无法揭开的奥秘。例如，经上说他给了一千锭银子，但这一千锭银子没有给她的丈夫，却给了她的哥哥；还有“这要给你在与你一起的所有人，并众人面前作遮眼的”；“她是清白的”等细节。事实上，很多历史推理取自字义，它们全都没有任何属灵之物，更不用说神性之物了。这就是圣言的性质。<br />至于理性真理对属灵真理来说就象一个遮盖物或一件衣裳，情况是这样：人的至内在之物属于他的灵魂，而外在之物则属于他的身体。前者就是良善与真理，灵魂从中拥有生命，否则灵魂便不是灵魂了。而后者则从灵魂得其生命，并且它们当中的每一个都象一个身体，或也可说，象一个遮盖物或衣裳。这一点尤其从来世可见之物清楚看出来，如从呈于眼见的天使就能看出来。他们的内在从脸上闪耀出来，而外在则表现在身体和衣着上，并且表现得如此充分，以致在那里谁都能仅仅通过他们的衣服就知道他们的品性。因为每位天使都是真实的实质，因而是有形的本质。在圣言中，被看到的天使也是如此，经上描述了他们的相貌，如在主的坟墓中所看到的那些天使（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太28.3.htm">28:3</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可16.5.htm">16:5</a>）；宝座周围的二十四位长老（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启4.4.htm">4:4</a>）等等。这不仅适用于天使，还适用于圣言中提及所有其它事物，甚至无生命之物。它们的外在都是遮盖物或衣服。如约柜和它周围的帐幕。约柜因是至内在的，故代表主自己，因为它里面有十诫；而约柜外面的帐幕则代表主的国度。而那里的每一个“遮盖物”，也就是幔子和帘子则代表主国度，即三层天中外在的属天和属灵之物。这从以下事实明显看出来：帐幕的样式是在西奈山上被指示给摩西（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出25.9.htm">25:9</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/出26.30.htm">26:30</a>）。帐幕的圣洁由此而来，而非来自它里面的金、银和雕刻物。<br />由于此处所论述的理性真理对属灵真理来说，就象遮盖物或衣裳，还由于摩西书描述了帐幕的遮盖物或帘子，故为了说明，我们解释一下幔子的具体含义。至于帘子的含义，蒙主怜悯，我会在别处予以阐明。帐幕有三种幔子：第一种是用来隔开圣所与至圣所的；第二种被称为帐幕门帘；第三种被称为院门之帘。<br />关于第一种，也就是幔子本身，即约柜前的帘子，我们在摩西书中读到：<br />你要用蓝色、紫色、朱红色线和捻的细麻织幔子，以巧匠的手工绣上基路伯。要把幔子挂在四根包金的皂荚木柱子上，柱子上的钩要用金作，柱子安在四个带卯的银座上。要把法柜抬进幔子内，这幔子要将圣所和至圣所隔开。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出26.31.htm">26:31</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出26.34.htm">34</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/出36.35.htm">36:35</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出36.36.htm">36</a>）<br />这种幔子代表理性良善与真理的最接近和最内在的表象，也就是第三层天的天使所在的表象。这些表象被描述为蓝色、紫色、朱红色线和捻的细麻，其红色代表爱之善，白色则代表它的真理。包柱子，以及作钩子和带卯的座的金银也具有同样的代表性。至于颜色具有代表性，可参看1042，1043，1053，1624节；“金”表爱之善，参看113，1551，1552节；“银”表真理，参看1551，2048节。<br />由此可见帐幕的幔子裂为两半（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太27.51.htm">27:51</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可15.38.htm">15:38</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路23.45.htm">23:45</a>）表示什么，也就是说，主通过驱散一切表象而进入神性本身；并且祂同时打开了经由祂变成神性的人性而通往祂的神性本身之路。<br />至于第二种幔子，或帷幕门帘，我们在摩西书中读到：<br />你要拿蓝色、紫色、朱红色线和捻的细麻，用绣花的手工织帐幕的门帘。要用皂荚木为帘子作五根柱子，用金子包裹，柱子上的钩子要用金作，又要为柱子用铜铸造五个带卯的座。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出26.36.htm">26:36</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出26.37.htm">37</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/出36.37.htm">36:37</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出36.38.htm">38</a>）<br />这种帘子代表比前者更为低级或外在的良善与真理的表象，也就是说，它们是理性的中间表象，是第二层天的天使所在的表象。对这些表象的描述几乎和第一种一样，不同之处在于，这种帘子有五根柱子和五个带卯的座；“五”这个数字表示相对少许之物，因这些表象不象至内层或第三层天的表象那样如此一致或属天。数字“五”表少许，参看649，1686节。由于这些表象关注属世之物，故经上要求这些带卯的座要用铜来铸造，因为铜代表和表示属世良善（<a href="425.htm">425</a>，<a href="1551.htm">1551</a>节）。<br />至于第三种幔子，或院门之帘，我们在摩西书中读到：<br />院子的门当有帘子，长二十肘，要拿蓝色、紫色、朱红色线和捻的细麻，用绣花的手工织成，柱子四根，带卯的座四个。院子四围一切的柱子都要用银杆连络，柱子上的钩子要用银作，带卯的座要用铜作。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出27.16.htm">27:16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出27.17.htm">17</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/出38.18.htm">38:18</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出38.19.htm">19</a>）<br />这种帘子代表良善与真理的更为低级和外在的表象，是理性的最低级表象，也就是第一层天的天使所在的表象。由于这些表象与内在事物相对应，故对它们的描述也差不多一样。不同之处在于，这些柱子没有包金，而是用银杆连络，钩子是用银作的，所有这些均表示直接来源于记忆知识的理性真理；带卯的座是用铜作的，而铜表示属世良善。所有这一切表明，在会幕中，没有一物不代表主国度的属天和属灵之物；即所有事物都是照着存在于三层天堂中的属天和属灵之物的各种样式来作的；还表明，幔子或帘子表示至内层周围或之外类似身体或衣裳的事物。<br />此外，“幔子”、“帘子”、“衣服”或“衣裳”表相对低级的真理。这一点从圣言中的许多经文明显看出来，如以西结书：<br />你的篷帆是用埃及绣花细麻布做的，你的凉棚是用以利沙岛的蓝色、紫色布做的。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结27.7.htm">27:7</a>）<br />这论及“推罗”，它表示对属天和属灵之物的内在认知，因而表示那些拥有这些认知的人（<a href="1201.htm">1201</a>节）。“埃及绣花细麻布”表属记忆知识之物（“埃及”表记忆知识，<a href="1164.htm">1164</a>，<a href="1165.htm">1165</a>，<a href="1186.htm">1186</a>，<a href="1462.htm">1462</a>节）。“作凉棚的以利沙岛的蓝色、紫色布”表与内在敬拜相对应的仪式（<a href="1156.htm">1156</a>节）。<br />同一先知书：<br />靠海的君王必从宝座上下来，除去外袍，脱下花衣，披上战兢为衣，坐在地上。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结26.16.htm">26:16</a>）<br />这也论及“推罗”。“外袍”和“花衣”表源于记忆的认知，因而表较为低级的真理。<br /><br />我也使你身穿绣花衣服，脚穿海狗皮鞋，并用细麻布裹着你，用丝绸披在你身上。又用妆饰打扮你，将镯子戴在你手上，将链子戴在你项上。你用衣服为自己在高处结彩，在其上行邪淫。又用你的绣花衣服给他们遮身。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.10.htm">16:10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.11.htm">11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.16.htm">16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.18.htm">18</a>）<br />这论及“耶路撒冷”，也就是属灵的教会，描述了它早期的样子，以及败坏之后的样子。其相对低级的属灵之物和教义就是“绣花衣、细麻布和丝绸”。<br />以赛亚书：<br />主万军之耶和华从耶路撒冷和犹大，除掉众人所倚靠的粮，所仗赖的水。到那时，人在父家拉住弟兄说，你有衣服，可以作我们的官长。到那日，他必扬声说，我不做绑扎创伤的；因我家中没有粮食，也没有衣服，你们不可立我作百姓的官长。主必使锡安的女子头长秃疮。到那日，主必除掉华美的脚钏、发网、月牙圈、耳环、手镯、蒙脸的帕子、华冠、足练、华带、香盒、符囊、戒指、鼻环、吉服、外套、云肩、荷包、手镜、细麻衣、裹头巾、蒙身的帕子。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛3.1.htm">3:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛3.6.htm">6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛3.7.htm">7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛3.17.htm">17</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛3.24.htm">24</a>）<br />“耶路撒冷”表属灵的教会，“犹大”表属天的教会；“除掉众人所倚靠的粮，所仗赖的水”表良善与真理；官长所拥有的“衣服”表构成教义的真理；所列举的属锡安女子的各种衣服和装饰品表要从他们那里除掉的良善与真理的每一个属和种。若非此处所提及的每一个事物都表示教会所特有的某种事物，它们就不是圣言的一部分，其中每个词里面都有神性之物。经上所说拥有所有这些物品的“锡安的女子”表示那些构成教会的事物（参看<a href="2362.htm">2362</a>节）。<br />同一先知书：<br />锡安啊，醒来！醒来！披上你的能力。圣城耶路撒冷啊，穿上你华美的衣服！因为从今以后，未受割礼、不洁净的，再不得进入你内。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛51.1.htm">51:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛51.2.htm">2</a>）<br />“锡安”表属天的教会；“耶路撒冷”表属灵的教会；“华美的衣服”表信的神圣事物。同一先知书：<br />他们的网不能成为衣服；所做的也不能遮盖自己。他们的行为都是罪孽的作为。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛59.6.htm">59:6</a>）<br />“网”表不能变成衣服的编造的真理；“衣服”表教义和敬拜的外在真理；因此经上说“所做的也不能遮盖自己”。<br />同一先知书：<br />我因耶和华大大欢喜，我的灵魂以我的神为快乐。因祂给我穿上救恩的衣服，给我披上公义的外袍。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛61.10.htm">61:10</a>）<br />“救恩的衣服”表信之真理；“公义的外袍”表从仁爱流出的良善。启示录：<br />在撒狄，你还有几名是未曾污秽自己衣服的；他们要穿白衣与我同行，因为他们是配得过的。凡得胜的，必这样穿白衣。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启3.4.htm">3:4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启3.5.htm">5</a>）<br /><br />那警醒、看守衣服、免得赤身而行的有福了！（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启16.15.htm">16:15</a>）<br /><br />我看见宝座上坐着二十四位长老，身穿白衣。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启4.4.htm">4:4</a>）<br />此处很明显，“衣”并非指衣裳，而是指属灵之物，也就是真理的形式。<br />这一点同样可见于主论及世代的末了时所说的话中。那时，祂叫人们不要回来取衣裳（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.18.htm">24:18</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可13.16.htm">13:16</a>），“衣裳”就表示真理（参看<a href="2454.htm">2454</a>节）；还可见于祂对没穿礼服之人（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太22.11.htm">22:11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太22.12.htm">12</a>）和约翰的讲论中：<br />你们出去到底是要看什么？要看穿细软衣服的人吗？那穿细软衣服的人是在王宫里。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太11.8.htm">11:8</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路7.25.htm">7:25</a>）<br />这表示他们并不关心教义和敬拜的外在事物，而是关心内在事物，因此祂补充说：<br />你们出去究竟是要看什么？是先知吗？是的，我告诉你们，他比先知大多了。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太11.9.htm">11:9</a>）<br />“先知”在此表教义和敬拜的外在事物。<br />由于“衣服”表各种真理，故以色列人离开埃及时被命令向她们的邻舍要金银和衣裳，好给她们的儿女穿戴（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出3.22.htm">3:22</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/出12.35.htm">12:35</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出12.36.htm">36</a>）。<br />他们还被命令不可用两样搀杂的料做衣服穿在身上（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利19.19.htm">19:19</a>；申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申22.11.htm">22:11</a>）；并且被命令在衣服边上做繸子，在繸子上钉一根蓝细带子，当看见它时，他们就想起诫命并遵行（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民15.38.htm">15:38</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民15.40.htm">40</a>）。过去，他们还撕裂衣服（参看约书亚记<a href="http://39-27.cn/书7.6.htm">7:6</a>；士师记<a href="http://39-27.cn/士11.35.htm">11:35</a>；撒母耳记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上4.12.htm">4:12</a>；撒母耳记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下1.2.htm">1:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下1.11.htm">11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下1.12.htm">12</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下3.31.htm">3:31</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下13.30.htm">13:30</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下13.31.htm">31</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下15.32.htm">15:32</a>；列王记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上21.27.htm">21:27</a>；列王记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下5.7.htm">5:7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下5.8.htm">8</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下6.30.htm">6:30</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下22.11.htm">22:11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下22.14.htm">14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下22.19.htm">19</a>；以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛36.22.htm">36:22</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛37.1.htm">37:1</a>）。这种行为表示对以同样方式被撕碎的教义与真理的热忱，以及谦卑，因为没有任何属于他们的东西，这就是衣服的装饰品所表示的。<br />幔子、帘子、衣裳或衣服都表示这类事物，这一点从当时还是以色列的雅各的预言也能明显看出来：<br />他把小驴拴在葡萄树上，把驴驹拴在美好的葡萄树上。他在葡萄酒中洗了衣服，在血红葡萄汁中洗了袍褂。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.11.htm">49:11</a>）<br />若不通过内义，没人知道这些话表示什么，也就是说，“葡萄树”、“美好的葡萄树”、“小驴”、“驴驹”、“葡萄酒”，“血红葡萄汁”、“衣服”、“袍褂”分别表示什么。不过，显而易见，它们论及主，祂在此被称为“细罗”。所论述的主题是犹大，他代表主的神性属天之物；他在葡萄酒中所洗的衣服、在血红葡萄汁中所洗的袍褂表示主的理性和属世之物，祂要把它们变成神性。<br />同样在以赛亚书：<br />这从以东的波斯拉来，穿红衣服、装扮华美、能力广大、大步行走的是谁呢？就是我，是凭公义说话，以大能施行拯救。你的装扮为何有红色？你的衣服为何像踹酒榨的呢？我独自踹酒榨，众民中无一人与我同在。他们的胜利溅在我衣服上，我把我所有的衣裳都染污了。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛63.1.htm">63:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛63.3.htm">3</a>）<br />此处“衣服”和“衣裳”表主的人性，祂凭自己的力量通过试探的争战和胜利使人性变成神性；因此经上说“我独自踹酒榨，众民中无一人与我同在”。“以撒一闻以扫衣服上的香气，就给他祝福”（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创27.27.htm">27:27</a>）具有同样的意思。<br />主的神圣人性的圣洁本身也是衣裳，当祂变像时，这衣裳洁白放光，如马太福音所描述的：<br />当耶稣变了形像时，祂的脸面明亮如日头，衣裳洁白如光。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太17.2.htm">17:2</a>）<br />路加福音：<br />耶稣正祷告的时候，祂的面貌就改变了，衣服洁白放光。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路9.29.htm">9:29</a>）<br />马可福音：<br />当耶稣变像时，祂的衣服放光，极其洁白，象雪一样，地上漂布的，没有一个能漂得那样白。（马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可9.3.htm">9:3</a>）<br />亚伦进圣所所穿细麻布圣内袍也是同样的代表物（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利16.2.htm">16:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利16.4.htm">4</a>），他供祭司职分时为荣耀、为华美的圣衣也一样（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出28.2.htm">28:2</a>至末尾；<a href="http://39-27.cn/出39.1.htm">39:1</a>至末尾）。这些衣服没有一个细节不具有代表性。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2576</b></p><p><b>2576.</b>
Behold it is unto thee a covering of the eyes to all that are with thee. That this signifies that rational truths are like a covering or clothing to spiritual truths, is evident from the signification 
of a "covering" (concerning which presently); and from the signification of the "eyes," as being things intellectual (as is evident from very many passages in the Word); and also from the signification 
of "seeing," as being to understand (n. 2150, 2325). Everyone can see that in everything in this verse there are arcana which cannot be revealed except by some interior sense; such as the statement 
that he gave a thousand of silver, and that this is said to have been given, not to her husband, but to her brother; that it was a covering of the eyes both to her and to all that were with her, and 
also with all; and that thereby she was vindicated. Many historical conjectures might possibly be drawn from the sense of the letter, but without having anything spiritual in them, still less anything 
Divine; and yet this is what the Word is. [2] As regards rational truths being like a covering or clothing to spiritual truths, the case is this: Man's inmost things are those of his soul, and his 
outer things are those of his body; the former are goods and truths, from which the soul has its life, for otherwise the soul would not be a soul: the latter draw their life therefrom, and are all like 
a body, or what is the same, a covering or clothing. This is especially evident from the things that appear in the other life; as from angels when presented to view; for their interiors shine forth 
from their faces; their exteriors being represented in both their bodies and their dress; and this so fully that everyone there can know their quality from their garments alone; for these are real substances, 
and thus essences in form. The same is the case with the angels seen and described in respect to their faces and dress in the Word, such as those seen in the Lord's sepulcher (Matt. 28:3; Mark 
16:5); and the four and twenty elders around the throne (Rev. 4:4); and others. Nor is this the case with the angels only, but also with all other things that are mentioned in the Word, even those which 
are inanimate; in all cases their exteriors are a covering or clothing; as for example the ark of the covenant and the tent that was round about it; the ark, being the inmost, represented the Lord 
Himself, for therein was the Testimony; and the tent outside of it represented the Lord's kingdom. The clothing, that is, the veils and coverings, each and all represented the more exterior celestial 
and spiritual things in His kingdom, that is, in the three heavens; as is evident from the fact that the form of the Tent was shown to Moses on Mount Sinai (Exod. 25:9; 26:30). From this it had its 
holiness, and not from the gold, the silver, and the carvings, that were in it. [3] Since rational truths are now treated of, as being a kind of veil or clothing to spiritual truths, and as the tent 
is described in Moses in respect to its clothing or coverings, and also in respect to its veils which were before the entrance, for the sake of illustration we may explain what was specifically signified 
by the veils; but what was signified by the encompassing coverings will of the Lord's Divine mercy be told elsewhere. The veils of the tent were three: the first, which made the division between the 
holy and the holy of holies; the second, which is called the hanging for the door of the tent; and the third, which was the hanging for the gate of the court. [4] Concerning the veil itself, which 
was the first, before the ark, we read in Moses: </p>
<p>Thou shalt make a veil of hyacinthine, and bright crimson, and double-dyed scarlet, and fine twined linen, the work of a designer, thou shall make it 
with cherubim; and thou shalt hang it upon four pillars of shittim wood, overlaid with gold, and their hooks of gold; upon four bases of silver; and thou shalt hang the veil under the clasps; and thou 
shalt bring in thither, within the veil, the Ark of the Testimony; and the veil shall divide unto you between the Holy and the Holy of Holies (Exod. 26:31-34; 36:35-36). This veil represented the nearest 
and inmost appearances of rational good and truth, in which are the angels of the third heaven; which appearances are described by the hyacinthine, the bright crimson, the double-dyed scarlet, 
and the fine twined linen; in which the red color represented the goods of love, and the white its truths. The same is true also of the gold and silver with which the pillars were overlaid, and of which 
the hooks and the bases were made. (That colors are representative may be seen above, n. 1042, 1043, 1053, 1624; that "gold" is the good of love, n. 113, 1551, 1552; and that "silver" is truth, n. 
1551, 2048.) [5] From this we can see what is signified by the veil of the temple being rent in twain (Matt. 27:51; Mark 15:38; Luke 23:45), namely, that the Lord entered into the Divine Itself by dispersing 
all appearances; and that He at the same time opened the way to His Divine Itself through His Human made Divine.  [6] Concerning the second veil, or the hanging for the door of the tent, we 
read in Moses: </p>
<p>     Thou shalt make a hanging for the door of the tent, of hyacinthine, and bright crimson, and double-dyed scarlet, and fine-twined linen, the work of the embroiderer; and thou shalt 
make for the hanging five pillars of shittim wood, and overlay them with gold, and their hooks shall be of gold; and thou shalt cast for them five bases of brass (Exod. 26:36-37; 36:37-38). By this 
hanging were represented appearances of good and truth that are lower or more external than the former, that is, the middle ones of the rational, in which are the angels of the second heaven; which appearances 
are described almost in the same manner as the first, with the difference however that for this hanging there were five pillars and five bases, by which number is signified what is comparatively 
but little; for these appearances do not so cohere together, or are not so heavenly, as are the appearances of the inmost or third heaven. (Concerning the number five as meaning a little, see above, 
n. 649, 1686.) And because these appearances look to natural things, it was commanded that the bases should be cast of brass; for by brass was represented and signified natural good (n. 425, 1551). [7] 
Concerning the third veil, or the hanging for the gate of the court, we read in Moses: </p>
<p>     For the gate of the court shall be a hanging of twenty cubits, of hyacinthine, and bright crimson, and 
double-dyed scarlet, and fine-twined linen, the work of the embroiderer; their pillars four, and their bases four; all the pillars of the court round about shall be filleted with silver, their hooks 
of silver, but their bases of brass (Exod. 27:16-17; 38:18-19). By this hanging were represented still lower or more external appearances of good and truth, which are the lowest ones of the rational, 
in which are the angels of the first heaven. As these appearances correspond to interior things, they are described in a similar manner, yet with the difference that these pillars were not overlaid 
with gold, but filleted with silver, and that the hooks were of silver, by which are signified rational truths that derive their origin immediately from memory-knowledges; and the bases were of brass, 
by which are signified natural goods. All this shows that there was nothing in the Tent that was not representative of the celestial and spiritual things of the Lord's kingdom, or that all things were 
made according to the type of celestial and spiritual things in the three heavens; also that the veilings or coverings signified the things that are like a body or dress around or without the inmost. [8] 
Moreover that "veilings," "coverings," "clothing," or "garments" signify relatively lower truths, is evident from many passages in the Word, as in Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Fine linen with broidered work 
from Egypt was thy spread of sail; hyacinthine and bright crimson from the isles of Elishah was thy covering (Ezek. 27:7); </p>
<p>where Tyre is treated of, by which are signified interior knowledges of celestial 
and spiritual things, and consequently those who are in them (n. 1201); "broidered work from Egypt" denotes what is of memory-knowledge (that "Egypt" denotes this may be seen above, n. 1164, 1165, 
1186, 1462); "hyacinthine and bright crimson from the isles of Elishah, which was the covering," denote the rituals that correspond to internal worship (n. 1156). [9] In the same: </p>
<p>     All the princes 
of the sea shall come down from their thrones, and lay aside their robes, and put off their broidered garments; they shall be clothed with tremblings, they shall sit upon the earth (Ezek. 26:16); </p>
<p> 
    also speaking of Tyre "robes" and "broidered garments" denote knowledges derived from the contents of the memory [cognitionibus ex scientificis], and thus lower truths. [10] In the same: </p>
<p>  
   I clothed thee with broidered work, and shod thee with badger, and girded thee about with fine linen, and covered thee with silk; I decked thee also with ornaments, and put bracelets upon thy hands, 
and a necklace upon thy throat. Thou didst take of thy garments, and madest for thee high places with divers colors, and didst commit whoredom upon them; thou tookest thy broidered garments, and coveredst 
them (Ezek. 16:10-11, 16, 18); </p>
<p>speaking of Jerusalem, which is the spiritual church, described as it was of old, and such as it was afterwards, when perverted: its lower spiritual things and its 
doctrinal matters are the "garments of broidered work, fine linen, and silk." [11] In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     The Lord Jehovih Zebaoth doth take away from Jerusalem the whole staff of bread and the staff of 
water. Then shall a man take hold of his brother, of the house of his father-Thou hast a garment, be thou our prince. In that day he shall lift up his voice, saying, I will not be a binder up, and in 
my house there is neither bread, nor garment; ye shall not make me a prince of the people. The Lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion; and in that day the Lord will 
take away the bravery of their anklets, and their network, and crescents, and their collars, and chains, and plates; and the headtires, and the ankle chains, and the sashes, and the soul houses, and 
the ear-drops; the rings, and the nose jewels, the festival garments, and the mantles, and the robes, and the satchels, the mirrors, and the fine linen, and the turbans, and the cloaks (Isa. 3:1, 6-7, 
17-24). "Jerusalem" denotes the spiritual church; "Judah" the celestial church; the "staff of bread and the staff of water, which will be removed," denote good and truth; the "garment which the prince 
should have," the truths which are of doctrine; the clothing and various ornaments of the daughters of Zion, which are enumerated, all and each, the kinds and varieties of good and truth, of which 
they would be deprived. Unless everything here mentioned signified something peculiar to the church, they would not be of the Word, in every expression of which there is what is Divine; but they are 
predicated of the daughters of Zion, and by these are signified the things of the church, as may be seen above (n. 2362). [12] In the same: </p>
<p>     Awake! awake! put on thy strength, O Zion; put on the 
garments of thy beauty, O Jerusalem, the city of holiness; for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean (Isa. 52:1, 2); </p>
<p>"Zion" denotes the celestial church; "Jerusalem" 
the spiritual church; and "garments of beauty" the holy things of faith. In the same: </p>
<p>     Their webs shall not become a garment, neither shall they cover themselves with their works; their 
works are works of iniquity (Isa. 59:6); </p>
<p>"webs" denote fictitious truths that do not become a garment; a "garment" denotes the exterior truths of doctrine and of worship; hence it is said, "neither 
shall they cover themselves with their works." [13] In the same: </p>
<p>     Rejoicing I will rejoice in Jehovah, my soul shall exult in my God; for He hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, He hath 
covered me with the robe of righteousness (Isa. 61:10); </p>
<p>the "garments of salvation" denote the truths of faith; and the "robe of righteousness" the good of charity. In John: </p>
<p>     Thou hast a few 
names even in Sardis that have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with Me in white, for they are worthy; he that overcometh shall be clothed in white raiment (Rev. 3:4-5).      Blessed is 
he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked (Rev. 16:15). In the same: </p>
<p>     Upon the thrones I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white garments (Rev. 4:4); </p>
<p>where it 
is manifest that the "garments" are not garments, but the spiritual things of truth. [14] So where the Lord said in reference to the consummation of the age that they should not return back to take 
their garments (Matt. 24:18; Mark 13:16), where that "garments" are truths may be seen above (n. 2454). Also in regard to the one not clothed in a wedding garment (Matt. 22:11, 12). And concerning John: </p>
<p> 
    What went ye out to see? a man clothed in bright* garments? Behold they that wear bright* garments are in kings' houses (Matt. 11:8; Luke 7:25); </p>
<p>meaning that they were not in the externals 
of doctrine and worship, but in the internals; on which account He adds: </p>
<p>     What went ye out to see? a prophet? yea, I say unto you and more than a prophet (Matt. 11:9); </p>
<p>a "prophet" denotes the externals 
of doctrine and of worship. [15] As "garments" signified truths of every kind, it was commanded that the sons of Israel on going out of Egypt should borrow gold and silver, and garments, and 
put them upon their sons (Exod. 3:22; 12:35-36); also that garments of various kinds, or mixed garments, should not be worn (Lev. 19:19; Deut. 22:11); and that they should make for themselves fringes 
on the borders of their garments, and should put a blue thread there, and that when they saw it they should call to mind the commandments, and do them (Num. 15:38-40). [16] Formerly also they rent their 
garments (as is seen in Josh. 7:6; Judges 11:35; 1 Sam. 4:12; 2 Sam. 1:2, 11-12; 3:31; 13:30-31; 15:32; 1 Kings 21:27; 2 Kings 5:7-8; 6:30; 22:11, 14, 19; Isa. 36:22; 37:1); by which was signified 
zeal for doctrine and truth, which was thus torn to pieces; and also humiliation, because there was nothing appertaining to them that is signified by the adornment of garments. [17] That such things 
are signified by "veilings," "coverings," "clothing," or "garments" is also manifest from the prophecy of Jacob, then Israel: </p>
<p>He shall bind his foal to the vine, and his ass's colt unto the choice vine; 
he shall wash his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes (Gen. 49:11); </p>
<p>what these words signify can be known to none except from the internal sense; namely a "vine," a "choice 
vine," a "foal," an "ass's colt," "wine," the "blood of grapes," "garments," and "clothes"; but it is evident that they are predicated of the Lord, who is here called "Shiloh." The subject spoken of is 
Judah, by whom is represented the Lord's Divine celestial; and by the "garments he should wash in wine," and "the vesture he should wash in the blood of grapes" are signified the Lord's rational and 
natural, which He should make Divine. [18] In like manner in Isaiah: </p>
<p>Who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah; this that is glorious in his apparel, marching in the multitude 
of his strength? Wherefore art thou red in thine apparel, and thy garment like him that treadeth in the wine vat? I have trodden the winepress alone, and of the peoples there was none with me; their 
victory is sprinkled upon my garments, and I have stained all my raiment (Isa. 63:1-3); </p>
<p>where also "garments" and "raiment" denote the Lord's Human which of His own power He made Divine by combats 
of temptations and by victories; on which account it is said, "I have trodden the winepress alone, and of the peoples there was none with me." Isaac's smelling the smell of Esau's garments, and so blessing 
him (Gen. 27:27), involved the same. [19] The Holy itself of the Lord's Divine Human was also a garment which appeared as the light, and as white and glistening, when He was transfigured, concerning 
which we read in Matthew: </p>
<p>When Jesus was transfigured, His face did shine as the sun, and His garments became as the light (Matt. 17:2). In Luke: </p>
<p>     When Jesus prayed, the appearance of His 
countenance was changed, and His raiment became white and glistening (Luke 9:29). And in Mark: </p>
<p>     When Jesus was transfigured, His garments became shining, exceeding white like snow, so as no fuller 
on earth can white them (Mark 9:3). The garments of holiness with which Aaron was clothed when he entered within the veil, and which were of linen, had a similar representation (Lev. 16:2, 4): likewise 
the garments of holiness that were for glory and for beauty; and those of his ministry (Exod. 28:2 to the end, and 39:1 to the end): for in these there was not one whit that was not representative. *

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2576</b></p><p><b>2576.</b>
'Behold, it is for you a covering of the eyes for all who are with you' means that rational truths are like a covering or garment for spiritual truths. This is clear from the meaning of 'a covering', 
to be dealt with immediately below, and from the meaning of 'the eyes' as things of the understanding, as is evident from very many places in the Word, and also from the meaning of 'seeing' as understanding, <a href="2150.htm">2150</a>, <a href="2325.htm">2325</a>. Anyone may see that each detail in this verse holds arcana within it which cannot be brought to light except by some interior sense _ such as the detail that it is said 'he gave a 
thousand pieces of silver to her brother' not 'to her husband'; or the details that it was 'a covering of the eyes', and that it was 'for her and all who were with her', also 'with all'; or the detail 
'so she was vindicated'. Many historical inferences might indeed be drawn from the sense of the letter, but none of these would have anything spiritual in them, still less anything Divine. Such is the 
nature of the Word. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 As regards rational truths being like a covering or garment for spiritual truths, the position is that the inmost parts of man's being belong to his soul, while the more 
exterior belong to his body. Man's inmost parts consist in goods and truths from which the soul has its life, or else the soul would not be a soul. Those which are more exterior however derive their life 
from the soul, and each one of them is like a body, or what amounts to the same, a covering or garment. This becomes clear in particular from the things that are seen in the next life, for example, 
from angels when these are presented to view. The interior parts of their beings shine from their faces, while the exterior are represented both in their bodies and in the clothes they are wearing, 
so completely that anyone there may recognize the character of those angels simply from the clothes they are wearing; for every angel consists of real substance and so is an essence given outward form. 
It is similar in the case of angels who have been seen and whose faces and clothing are described in the Word, such as those seen in the Lord's tomb, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2028:%203&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 28: 3</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%2016:%205&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 16: 5</a>; and the twenty-four elders 
around the throne, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%204:%204&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 4: 4</a>; and others. Nor does this apply only to angels but also to everything else, even inanimate objects, mentioned in the Word. Their exteriors are a covering or garment as 
with the Ark of the Covenant and the tent surrounding it. 'The Ark' there, which was inmost, represented the Lord Himself, for the Testimony belonged there, while 'the tent' outside of it represented 
the Lord's kingdom. Every single one of 'the coverings' there, that is, the veils and screens, represented the exterior celestial and spiritual things within the Lord's kingdom, that is to say, within 
the three heavens This becomes clear from the plan of it that was shown to Moses on Mount Sinai, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2025:%209;%2026:%2030&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 25: 9; 26: 30</a>. It was this that gave it its holiness, not the gold and silver and the carvings 
that were in it. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Since the matter of rational truths being like a covering or garment to spiritual truths is being discussed here, and since in Moses a description of the Tent is given - of its 
coverings or of its screens, and also of its veils in front of places of entry - let an explanation be given, for the sake of illustration, of what specifically was meant by the veils. (But what was 
meant by the enveloping covers will in the Lord's Divine mercy be stated elsewhere.) The Tabernacle had three veils, the first, which made a division between the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies; the 
second, which is called a screen serving as a door into the tent; the third, which is called a screen serving as a gate into the court. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 The first of these, the veil itself, which was a screen 
in front of the Ark, is referred to in Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
You shall make a veil of violet and purple and twice-dyed scarlet and fine-twined linen. The work of a designer,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> you shall make it with cherubs on it. 
And you shall hang it on four pillars of shittim, overlaid with gold, and their hooks shall be of gold; [they shall stand] on four bases of silver. And you shall hang the veil under the clasps. And you 
shall bring in, within the veil, the Ark of the Testimony, and the veil shall divide for you the Holy Place from the Holy of Holies. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2026:%2031-34;%2036:%2035,%2036&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 26: 31-34; 36: 35, 36</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This veil represented the most immediate 
and inmost appearances of rational good and truth, which occur among the angels of the third heaven. These appearances are described by the violet, purple, twice-dyed scarlet, and fine-twined 
linen, the red of which represented the goods that belong to love, and the white its truths. Also, the gold and silver with which the pillars were overlaid, and of which the hooks and bases were made 
had a similar representation. As regards colours being representative, see <a href="1042.htm">1042</a>, <a href="1043.htm">1043</a>, <a href="1053.htm">1053</a>, <a href="1624.htm">1624</a>; and as regards 'gold' meaning the good of love, <a href="113.htm">113</a>, <a href="1551.htm">1551</a>, <a href="1552.htm">1552</a>, and 'silver' truth, <a href="1551.htm">1551</a>, <a href="2048.htm">2048</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
This shows what is meant by the veil of the temple being torn in two, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2027:%2051&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 27: 51</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%2015:%2038&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 15: 38</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2023:-45%20-%20n&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 23:-45 - n</a>amely that once all appearances had been dispelled the Lord entered into the Divine 
Itself, and at the same time He opened a means of access to the Divine Itself through His Human that had been made Divine. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 The second veil, or screen serving as a door to the tent, is referred 
to in Moses as follows, </p>
<blockquote>
You shall make a screen for a door of the tent, of violet and purple and twice-dyed scarlet and fine-twined linen, the work of an embroiderer. And you shall make for the screen 
five pillars of shittim and overlay them with gold, and their hooks shall be of gold; and you shall cast for them five bases of bronze. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2026:%2036,%2037;%2036%2037,%2038&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 26: 36, 37; 36 37, 38</a> 
</blockquote>
<p>This screen represented the 
appearances of good and truth which are lower and more exterior than those mentioned already; that is, they are the middle appearances that belong to the rational, which occur among the angels of the 
second heaven. The description given to these appearances is virtually the same, the difference being that this screen had five pillars and five bases, by which number is meant something relatively small, 
for these appearances are not so unified or heavenly as the appearances belonging to the inmost or third heaven. Regarding the number 'five' meaning that which is small, see <a href="649.htm">649</a>, <a href="1686.htm">1686</a>. And because 
these appearances look to natural things, it was commanded that the bases should be cast of bronze; for bronze represented and meant natural good, <a href="425.htm">425</a>, <a href="1551.htm">1551</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 The third veil, or screen serving 
as a gate into the court, is referred to in Moses as follows, </p>
<blockquote>
The screen for a gate of the court shall be twenty cubits [long], of violet and purple and twice-dyed scarlet and fine-twined linen, the 
work of an embroiderer; the pillars of it shall be four and the bases of these four. All the pillars of the surrounding court shall be fastened with silver; their hooks shall be of silver but their 
bases of bronze. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2027:%2016,%2017;%2038:%2018,%2019&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 27: 16, 17; 38: 18, 19</a> 
</blockquote>
<p>This screen represented the still lower and more exterior appearances of good and truth, which are the lowest appearances belonging to the rational, and 
which occur among the angels of the first heaven. Because these appearances correspond to those that are more interior the description given to them is also much the same, the differences being that 
the pillars were not overlaid with gold but were fastened together with silver, while the hooks were made of silver - all of which mean rational truths such as have their origin immediately in factual 
knowledge - and the bases were made of bronze which mean natural goods. All these considerations show that there was nothing in the Tent which was not representative of the celestial and spiritual 
things of the Lord's kingdom; that is, they show that all those things were made so as to provide every type or imprint of the celestial and spiritual things that exist in the three heavens. And they 
also show that the coverings or screens meant things which, like a body or clothing, surround or are outside of that which is inmost. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[8]</b>
 In addition to all this, the fact that coverings, screens, 
and a garment or clothes mean relatively lower truths becomes clear from many places in the Word, as in Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
Fine linen with embroidered work from Egypt was your sail, violet and purple from the 
islands of Elishah was your covering.<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2027:%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 27: 7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to 'Tyre', which means interior cognitions of celestial and spiritual things, and therefore those who possess those cognitions, <a href="1201.htm">1201</a>. 
'Embroidered work from Egypt' stands for factual knowledge - 'Egypt' meaning factual knowledge, <a href="1164.htm">1164</a>,<a href="1165.htm">1165</a>,<a href="1186.htm">1186</a>, <a href="1462.htm">1462</a>. 'Violet and purple from the islands of Elishah as a covering' stands for forms 
of ritual corresponding to internal worship, <a href="1156.htm">1156</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[9]</b>
 In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
All the princes of the sea will step down from upon their thrones, and will remove their robes and will strip off their 
embroidered clothes. They will clothe themselves with tremblings; they will sit on the ground. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2026:%2016&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 26: 16</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This too refers to 'Tyre'. 'Robes' and 'embroidered clothes' stand for cognitions formed 
out of factual knowledge, and so stand for lower truths. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[10]</b>
 In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
I clothed you with embroidered cloth and shod you with badger, and I swathed you in fine linen and covered 
you with silk, and I adorned you with adornments and put bracelets on your hands and a chain on your neck. You took some of your garments and made for yourself gaily-decked high places and committed whoredom 
on them. You took your embroidered clothes and covered them. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2016:%2010,%2011,%2016,%2018&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 16: 10, 11, 16, 18</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This describes 'Jerusalem', which is the spiritual Church, as it had been in early times and as it was 
subsequently when perverted. Its lower spiritual things and its matters of doctrine are the embroidered clothes, fine linen, and silk. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[11]</b>
 In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
The Lord, Jehovah Zebaoth, is taking away 
from Jerusalem and from Judah the whole staff of bread and staff of water. At that time a man will take hold of his brother, of his father's house, [saying,] You have clothing, you will be leader for 
us. On that day he will speak out, saying, I will not be a binder up; and in my house there is neither bread nor clothing. You shall not make me leader of the people. The Lord will smite with a scab the

<p>'Jerusalem' stands for the spiritual Church, 'Judah' for the celestial Church, 'the 
staff of bread and the staff of water which will be taken away' for good and truth. 'The clothing which the leader will have' stands for the truths that make up doctrine. The various articles of clothing 
and adornments that are listed belonging to the daughters of Zion mean every single genus and species of good and truth which were to be taken away from them. Unless each item that is mentioned meant 
some specific detail of the Church they would not be part of the Word, every expression of which has what is Divine within it. 'The daughters of Zion' who are said to possess all these articles means 
those things that constitute the Church; see <a href="2362.htm">2362</a>. </p>

 In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Awake, awake, put on your strength, O Zion, put on your beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city; no more may 
there come in to you the uncircumcised and the unclean. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2052:%201,%202&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 52: 1, 2</a>.

<p>'Zion' stands for the celestial Church, 'Jerusalem' for the spiritual, 'beautiful garments' for the sacred things of faith. 
In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Their webs do not become clothing, neither are they covered in their works. Their works are works of iniquity. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2059:%206&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 59: 6</a>.

<p>'Webs' stands for made-up truths which do not become 
clothing. 'Clothing' stands for exterior truths of doctrine and worship, hence the statement 'neither are they covered in their works'. </p>

 In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
I will greatly rejoice in Jehovah, 
my soul will exult in my God, for He will clothe me with the clothes of salvation, with the rove of righteousness has He covered me. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2061:%2010&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 61: 10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The clothes of salvation' stands for truths 
of faith, 'the robe of righteousness' for the good that flows from charity. In John, </p>
<blockquote>
You have a few names also in Sardis, who have not soiled their garments, and they will walk with Me in white, for 
they are worthy. He who conquers will be clad in white garments. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%203:%204,%205&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 3: 4, 5</a>.

<p>In the same book, </p>

<p>Here it is evident that 'garments' do not mean garments but spiritual things, which are forms 
of truth. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[14]</b>
 The same may be seen in what the Lord said when speaking about the close of the age. When He said that people were not to turn back and fetch their garments, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2024:%2018&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 24: 18</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%2013:&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 13:</a> 
<a href="16.htm">16</a>, truths were meant by 'garments', see <a href="2454.htm">2454</a>, as they also are in His reference to the man who was not wearing a wedding garment, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2022:%2011,%2012&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 22: 11, 12</a>, and in His reference to John, </p>
<p>What did you go 
out to see. A man clad in fine garments? Those who wear fine garments are in kings' houses. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2011:%208&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 11: 8</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%207:-25&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 7:-25</a>. </p>
<p>This means that they did not care about the external things of doctrine and worship 
but about the internal, and this is why He adds, </p>
<blockquote>
What did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2011:%209&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 11: 9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'A prophet' here stands for the external things 
of doctrine and worship.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[15]</b>
 As 'clothes' meant truths of every kind the children of Israel were commanded when leaving Egypt to ask from their neighbour for gold and silver, and for clothes, and 
to place them on their children, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%203:%2022;%2012:%2035,%2036&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 3: 22; 12: 35, 36</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[16]</b>
 They were also commanded not to wear clothes made from different kinds of stuff, or to wear mixed ones, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%2019:%2019&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 19: 19</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2022:%2011&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 22: 11</a>; 
and were commanded to make tassels for the hems of their clothes, to put a violet cord there, and when they saw it were to recollect the commandments and carry them out, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2015:%2038-40&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 15: 38-40</a>. In former times 
they also rent their clothes, as is evident in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Josh%207:%206&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Josh 7: 6</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Judg%2011:%2035;%201&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Judg 11: 35; 1</a> <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Sam%204:%2012;%202&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Sam 4: 12; 2</a> <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Sam%201:%202,%2011,%2012;%203:%2031;%2013:%2030,%2031;%2015:%2032;%201&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Sam 1: 2, 11, 12; 3: 31; 13: 30, 31; 15: 32; 1</a> Kings 21: <a href="27.htm">27</a>; <a href="2.htm">2</a> Kings 5: <a href="7.htm">7</a>, <a href="8.htm">8</a>; 6: <a href="30.htm">30</a>; 22: <a href="11.htm">11</a>, <a href="14.htm">14</a>, <a href="19.htm">19</a>; Isa. 36: 
<a href="22.htm">22</a>; 37: <a href="1.htm">1</a>. This action meant a zealous regard for doctrine and truth which had in a similar way been torn to shreds, and also a humble recognition that nothing existed with them, which is meant by the 
adornment of clothing. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[17]</b>
 That veils, screens, garments, or clothes mean such things is also evident with the prophecy of Jacob, who by now was Israel, </p>
<p>He will bind his colt to the vine, and 
the foal of his ass to a choice vine. He will wash his clothing in wine, and his garment in the blood of grapes. Gen. 49: <a href="11.htm">11</a>. </p>
<p>What these words mean nobody can know except from the internal sense, 
that is to say, what is meant by 'a vine', 'a choice vine', 'a colt', 'the foal of an ass', 'wine', 'the blood of grapes', 'clothing', and 'garment'. That it is a reference to the Lord who in that prophecy 
is called 'Shiloh' is self-evident. The reference at this point is to Judah who represents the Lord's Divine celestial. 'The clothing he was to wash in wine' and 'the garment in the blood of grapes' 
mean His Rational and Natural which He was to make Divine. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[18]</b>
 Similarly in Isaiah, </p>
<p>Who is this coming from Edom, with dyed clothes from Bozra, he that is glorious in his apparel, marching 
in the vast numbers of his strength? Why are you red as to your clothing, and your clothes like his that treads the winepress? And I have trodden the winepress alone, and from the peoples no one was 
with me. Their victory has been sprinkled on my clothes, and I have stained all my raiment. Isa. 63: <a href="1.htm">1</a>-<a href="3.htm">3</a>. </p>
<p>Here also 'clothes' and 'raiment' stand for the Lord's Human which, by means of the conflicts 
brought about by temptations and by means of victories, He made Divine by His own power; hence the statement, 'I have trodden the winepress alone, and from the peoples no one was with me'. The reference 
to 'Isaac smelling the smell of Esau's clothes, and so blessing him' implies much the same, Gen. 27: <a href="27.htm">27</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[19]</b>
 The Holiness itself of the Lord's Divine Human was also a garment which was seen 
as light and as something dazzling white when He was transfigured, described in Matthew as follows, </p>
<p>When Jesus was transfigured His face shone like the sun, and His clothes became [white] as the light. 
Matt. 17: <a href="2.htm">2</a>. </p>
<p>In Luke, </p>
<p>When Jesus was praying the appearance of His face was altered; His clothing became dazzling white. Luke 9: <a href="29.htm">29</a>. </p>
<p>And in Mark, </p>
<p>When Jesus was transfigured His clothes 
became glistening, intensely white like snow, as no fuller on earth could bleach them. Mark 9: <a href="3.htm">3</a>. </p>
<p>The sacred vestments worn by Aaron when he went inside the veil, which were made of linen, were 
similarly representative, Lev. 16: <a href="2.htm">2</a>, <a href="4.htm">4</a>, and so were the sacred vestments 'for glory and adornment' when he ministered, which are described in Exod. 28: <a href="2.htm">2</a>-end; 39: <a href="1.htm">1</a>-end. Not a detail of those vestments 
failed to be representative.

Quod `ecce illud tibi velamen oculorum omnibus qui tecum' significet quod vera rationalia sint instar velaminis aut amictus veris spiritualibus, constat a significatione `velaminis,' de qua mox sequitur, 
et a significatione `oculorum' quod sint intellectualia, ut patet a perplurimis locis in Verbo; tum a significatione `videre' quod sit intelligere, n. 2150, 2325; quisque videre potest quod in singulis 
in hoc versu arcana sint, quae non patefieri possunt nisi a sensu quodam interiore; ut, quod `dederit mille argenti,' et hoc dicatur non marito sed `fratri ejus,' quod illud esset `velamen oculorum,' 
et `ei et omnibus qui cum illa,' tum `cum omnibus' et quod `sic vindicata'; plures quidem conjecturae historicae ex sensu litterae deduci possent, sed omnes illae non habent aliquid spirituale, 
minus Divinum, quale tamen est Verbum.  [2] Quod vera rationalia sint instar velaminis seu amictus veris spiritualibus, ita se habet: quae intima sunt hominis, illa sunt ejus animae, quae autem exteriora 
sunt, illa sunt ejus corporis; intima hominis sunt bona et vera ex quibus anima suam vitam habet, alioquin anima non esset anima; exteriora inde {1} trahunt suam vitam, et sunt omnia corporis instar, 
seu quod idem est, sunt velaminis aut amictus instar; quod imprimis constare potest ab illis quae in altera vita apparent, ut ab angelis cum sistuntur videndi, eorum interiora elucent a facie, exteriora 
repraesentantur tam in corpore quam in amictu eorum, usque adeo ut quilibet ibi ex solo amictu scire possit quales sunt; sunt enim reales substantiae, ita essentiae in forma; cum angelis qui 
visi, et quoad facies et amictus descripti in Verbo, similiter se habet, `ut qui visi in sepulcro Domini, Matth. xxviii 3; Marc. xvi 5; et viginti quatuor seniores circum thronum, Apoc. iv (x)4, et alii(n) 
nec solum cum angelis, sed etiam cum omnibus reliquis tametsi inanimata, quae memorantur in Verbo; eorum exteriora sunt velamen aut amictus, sicut cum arca foederis et cum tentorio quod circumcirca; 
`arca' ibi, quae intimum, repraesentabat Ipsum Dominum, nam ibi testimonium, at `tentorium' quod extra, repraesentabat regnum Domini; `velamina' ibi, seu vela et tegumenta, omnia et singula repraesentabant 
exteriora caelestia et spiritualia in Ipsius regno, nempe in tribus caelis; quod constare potest inde quod forma ejus ostensa sit Mosi in monte Sinai, Exod. xxv 9; xxvi 30; inde sanctitatem 
suam habuit, non autem ab auro et argento et a sculpturis quae ibi: [3] quia nunc agitur de veris rationalibus quod sint instar velaminis aut amictus veris spiritualibus, et apud Mosen describitur tentorium, 
quoad `velamina' ejus aut tegumenta, etiam quoad vela quae ante introitus, licet illustrationis causa exponere quid in specie per `vela' ibi significatum sit; quid autem per tegumenta circumcirca, 
alibi, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, dicetur: vela ibi fuerunt tria, primum, quod fecit discrimen inter Sanctum et Sanctum sanctorum; alterum, quod vocatur tegumentum pro janua tentorii; [4] tertium, 
quod tegumentum pro porta atrii: de ipso velo, quod primum, ante arcam, ita apud Mosen; </p>
<p>	Facies velum ex hyacinthino et purpura, et coccineo dibapho et xylino intertexto, opus excogitationis, 
facies illud cum cherubis et dabis illud super quatuor columnis shittim, obductis auro, e unci earum ex auro; super quatuor basibus argenti; et dabis velum sub ansulis; et inferes eo, intra velum, arcam 
testimonii, et distinguet velum vobis inter Sanctum et Sanctum sanctorum Exod. xxvi 31-34, xxxvi 35, 36; </p>
<p>hoc velum repraesentabat apparentias proximas et intimas boni et veri rationalis, in quibus 
sunt angeli tertii caeli, quae apparentiae descriptae sunt per `hyacinthinum, purpuram, coccineum dibaphum, et xylinum intertextum,' in quibus color ruber repraesentabat bona amoris, et albus vera ejus; 
similiter etiam aurum et argentum quibus obducebantur columnae, et ex quibus unci et bases; quod `colores' repraesentent, videatur n. 1042, 1043, 1053, 1624; quod `aurum' sit bonum amoris, n. 113, 
1551, 1552; quod `argentum' sit verum, n. 1551, 2048; [5] inde constare potest quid significat, quod 	Velum templi discissum sit, Matth. xxvii 51; Marc. xv 38; Luc. xxiii 45, nempe quod Dominus intraverit 
in Ipsum Divinum omnibus apparentiis discussis, et quod simul aperuerit aditum ad ipsum Divinum per Suum Humanum Divinum factum.  [6] De altero, seu tegumento pro janua tentorii, ita apud Mosen, 	Facies 
tegumentum ad ostium tentorii, ex hyacinthino et purpura, et coccineo dibapho, et xylino intertexto, opus acupictoris: et facies ad tegumentum quinque columnas shittim, et obduces eas auro, 
unci earum ex auro, et fundes iis quinque bases aeris, Exod. xxvi 36, 37; xxxvi 37, 38; </p>
<p>per hoc tegumentum repraesentatae sunt apparentiae boni et veri, quae prioribus inferiores seu exteriores sunt, 
seu mediae rationalis, in quibus sunt angeli secundi caeli; quae apparentiae paene similiter descriptae sunt, cum differentia tamen quod pro illo tegumento `quinque columnae et quinque bases' essent, 
per quem numerum significatur parum respective, nam hae apparentiae non ita cohaerent aut ita caelestes sunt ac apparentiae intimi seu tertii caeli; de numero `quinque' quod parum, videatur n. 649, 
1686; et quia hae apparentiae spectant naturalia, mandatum quod `bases funderentur ex aere,' per aes enim repraesentabatur et significabatur bonum naturale {2}, n. 425, 1551.  [7] De tertio, seu tegumento 
pro porta atrii, ita apud Mosen, 	Portae atrii tegumentum, viginti cubitorum, ex hyacinthino et purpura, et coccineo dibapho, et xylino intertexto, opus acupictoris; columnae eorum quatuor, bases 
harum quatuor, omnes columnae atrii circumcirca cinctae argento, unci earum ex argento, sed bases earum ex aere, Exod. xxvii 16, 17; xxxviii 18, 19; </p>
<p>per hoc tegumentum repraesentatae sunt apparentiae 
boni et veri adhuc inferiores seu exteriores, quae sunt infimae rationalis, in quibus sunt angeli primi caeli; hae apparentiae quia correspondent interioribus, descriptae sunt similiter, cum differentia 
tamen quod columnae non obductae auro, sed cinctae argento et quod unci essent ex argento, quibus significantur vera rationalia ex scientificis ortum immediate ducentia, et bases ex aere, quibus 
significantur bona naturalia: inde constare potest quod nihil non ibi repraesentativum caelestium et spiritualium regni Domini fuerit, seu quod ad omnem typum caelestium et spiritualium in tribus caelis 
facta sint; tum quod velamina seu tegumenta significaverint illa quae instar corporis seu amictus sunt circum seu extra intimum. [8] Praeterea quod velamina, tegumenta, amictus seu vestes significent 
vera inferiora respective, constare potest a multis locis in Verbo; ut apud Ezechielem, 	Byssus in acupictura ex Aegypto fuit expansum tuum, hyacinthinum et purpura ex insulis Elisha [fuit] tegumentum 
tuum, xxvii 7; </p>
<p>ubi de `Tyro' per quam significantur cognitiones interiores caelestium et spiritualium, proinde qui in illis sunt, n. 1201; `acupictura ex Aegypto' pro scientifico; quod `Aegyptus' 
sit scientificum, n. 1164, 1165, 1186, 1462; `hyacinthinum et purpura ex insulis Elisha, quod tegumentum' pro ritualibus correspondentibus cultui interno, n. 1156: [9] apud eundem, 	Descendent desuper 
soliis suis omnes principes malis, et removebunt amicula sua, et vestes acupicturae suae exuent, terroribus induentur, super terra sedebant, xxvi 16; </p>
<p>etiam de `Tyro,' `amicula et vestes acupicturae'

<p>de `Hierosolyma' quae est Ecclesia spiritualis, descripta qualis antiquitus, et qualis postea cum perversa; ejus spiritualia inferiora et doctrinalia sunt `vestes acupicti, 
byssi, serici': [11] apud Esaiam, Dominus Jehovah Zebaoth removens ex Hierosolyma et ex Jehuda {3}... omnem baculum panis, et baculum aquae;... tunc apprehendet vir fratrem suum domus patris sui, {4} 
Vestis tibi princeps eris nobis:... excipiet in die isto, dicendo, Non ero alligans, et in domo mea non panis, et non vestis; ne ponatis me principem populi.... Scabie afficiet Dominus verticem filiarum

animae, et inaures: annulos, et ornamenta nasi, mutatorias vestes, et amicula, et pepla, et aciaria, specula, et sindones, et cidares, et palliola, iii 1, 6, 7, 17-24; </p>
<p>`Hierosolyma' pro Ecclesia spirituali, 
`Jehuda' pro Ecclesia caelesti, `baculus panis, et baculus aquae qui removebitur' pro bono et vero; `vestis quae principi' pro veris quae sunt doctrinae; `amictus (o)et ornatus varii filiarum 
Zionis' qui enumerantur, sunt omnes et singuli genera et species boni et veri quibus privarentur; nisi singula quae memorantur, aliquid peculiare Ecclesiae (x)significarent, non `forent Verbi, in cujus 
unaquavis voce Divinum; (m)praedicantur de `filiabus Zionis,' per quas quod illa quae Ecclesiae sunt, significentur, videatur n. 2362:(n) [12] apud eundem, 	Excitare, excitare, indue robur tuum, Zion, 
indue vestes decoris tui, Hierosolyma, civitas sanctitatis; quia non addet, veniat in te amplius praeputiatus et immundus, lii 1, 2; </p>
<p>`Zion' pro Ecclesia caelesti, `Hierosolyma' pro spirituali, `vestes 
decoris' pro sanctis fidei: apud eundem, 	Telae eorum non sunt ad vestem, neque teguntur operibus eorum, opera eorum, opera iniquitatis, lix 6; </p>
<p>`telae' pro fictis veris quae non sunt ad vestem, 
`vestis' pro veris exterioribus {5} doctrinae et cultus; inde dicitur `neque teguntur operibus': [13] apud eundem, 	Gaudendo gaudebo in Jehovah, exsultabit anima mea in 	Deo meo, quia induet me vestibus 
salutis, amiculo justitiae 	texit me, lxi 10; </p>
<p>`vestes salutis' pro veris fidei, `amiculum justitiae {6}' pro bono charitatis: apud Johannem, 	Habes pauca nomina etiam in Sardibus, quae non polluerunt 
vestimenta sua, et ambulabunt Mecum in albis, quia digni sunt: qui vicerit, is induetur vestimentis albis, Apoc. iii 4, 5: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Beatus qui vigilat, et servat vestimenta sua, ut non 
ambulet nudus, Apoc. xvi 15: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Super thronis vidi viginti et quatuor seniores sedentes, indutos vestimentis albis, Apoc. iv (x)4; </p>
<p>ubi quo d `vestimenta' non sint vestimenta, patet, sed 
spiritualia quae sunt veri: [14] similiter quod Dominus dixit (m)de consummatione saeculi quod `non reverterentur retro ad tollendum vestimenta,' Matth (x)xxiv 18; Marc. xiii 16, ubi quod `vestimenta' 
sint vera, videatur n. 2454(n): (o)tum quod de `non induto veste nuptiarum,' Matth xxii 11, 12; et quod de Johanne, 	Quid exivistis videre, num hominem splendidis vestimenti indutum? qui splendida gerunt, 
in domibus regum 	sunt, Matth xi 8; Luc. vii 25; </p>
<p>pro quod non in externis doctrinae et cultus, sed in internis, quare addit, 	Quid exivistis videre, num prophetam? Dico vobis, etiam magis quam 
propheta, (x)Matth. xi 9; </p>
<p>[15] `propheta' pro externis doctrinae et cultus.  (m)Quia `vestes' vera omni generis significabant, mandatum erat quod filii Israelis cum exirent Aegypto `mutuo peterent 
aurum et argentum, et vestes, et ponerent super filiis,' Exod. iii 22; xii 35, 36, tum quod `vestes plurium generum seu mixtae non induerentur,' Lev. xix 19; Deut. xxii 11; [16] et quo `facerent sibi 
peniculamenta in oris vestium, ponerent ibi filum hyacinthinum, et cum id viderent, recordarentur praeceptorum, et facerent ea,' Num. xv 38-40; discindebant etiam olim vestes, ut patet {7} Jos. vii 6; 
Jud. xi 35; 1 Sam. iv 12; 2 Sam. i 2, 11, 12; iii 31; xiii 30, 31; xv 32; 2 Reg. xxi 27; 2 Reg. v 7, 8; vi 30; xxii 11, 14 {8}, 19; Esai. xxxvi 22; xxxvii 1; (o)quod significabat zelum pro doctrina `ac 
vero, quod si laceratum; tum humiliationem, quod nihil apud eos, quod significatur per ornatum vestium.'  [17] Quod per velamina, tegumenta, amictus aut vestes talia significentur, etiam a prophetia 
Jacobi, tunc Israelis, patet {9}, 	Ligabit ad vitem pullum suum, et ad vitem nobilem filius asinae suae; lavabit in vino vestimentum suum, et in sanguine uvarum velamen suum, Gen. xlix 11; </p>
<p>quid haec 
significant, nemo scire potest nisi ex sensu interno, qui nempe `vitis, vitis nobilis, pullus, filius asinae, vinum, sanguis uvarum, vestimentum, et velamen'; quod de Domino Qui ibi vocatur `Shiloh 
manifestum est; agitur ibi de `Jehudah' per quem repraesentatur Divinum caeleste Domini; per `vestimentum quod lavaret in vino' per `velamen quod in sanguine uvarum', significatur Ipsius Rationale et 
Naturale, quod Divinum faceret: [18] similiter apud Esaiam, 	Quis hic veniens ex Edom, infectus vestes ex Bozra, hic honorabilis in vestitu suo, incedens in multitudine roboris sui?... Quare rubicundus 
quoad vestem tuam, et vestes {10} tuae sicut calcantis in torculari? Et torcular calcavi solus ego, et de populis non quisquam mecum:... sparsa est victoria eorum super vestes meas, et omne indumentum 
meum pollui, lxiii 1-3; </p>
<p>ubi etiam `vestes et indumentum' pro Humano Domini, quod per pugnas tentationum et victorias Divinum ex propria potentia fecit, (m)quare dicitur `torcular calcavi solus ego, 
et de populis non quisquam mecum': quod `Isacus odoraretur odium vestium Esavi, et sic benediceret,' Gen. xxvii 27, simile involvit. [19] Ipsum Sanctum Divini Humani Domini etiam fuit vestimentum 
quod apparuit sicut lux, et sicut album fulgurans cum transformatus, de quo ita apud Matthaeum, 	Cum Jesus transformatus, splenduit facies Ipsius sicut sol, vestimenta Ipsius facta sunt sicut lux, xvii 
2: </p>
<p>apud Lucam, 	Jesus cum oraret, facta est species faciei Ipsius alia, Ipsius vestimentum album fulgurans, ix 29: </p>
<p>et apud Marcum, 	Cum Jesus transformatus, vestimenta Ipsius facta splendentia, 
alba valde sicut nix, cujusmodi fullo super terra non potest dealbare, ix 3. Vestes sanctitatis quibus indutus Aharon, cum intraret intra velum, quae erant lini, simile {11} repraesentabant, Lev. xvi 
2, 4; pariter vestes sanctitatis quae ad gloriam et decus, (o)ac ministerii, de quibus' Exod. xxviii 2 ad fin; xxxix {12} 1 ad fin.; in illis ne illum erat quod non repraesentabat. 	@1 i vero.$ 	@2
