<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5838节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5838.</strong>创世记44:32-34.因为仆人曾向我父亲为这童子作保说，我若不带他回来交给你，我便在父亲面前终日担罪。现在求你容仆人住下，替这童子作我主的奴仆，叫童子和他哥哥们一同上去。若童子不和我同去，我怎能上去见我父亲呢？恐怕我看见灾祸临到我父亲身上。<br />“因为仆人曾向我父亲为这童子作保说”表对自己的一种依俯。“我若不带他回来交给你”表除非它与属灵良善联结。“我便在父亲面前终日担罪”表转身离开，教会的良善由此不复存在。“现在求你容仆人住下，替这童子作我主的奴仆”表顺服。“叫童子和他哥哥们一同上去”表好叫内层真理能与属灵良善联结。“若童子不和我同去，我怎能上去见我父亲呢”表来自属世层的属灵良善将没有内层真理。“恐怕我看见灾祸临到我父亲身上”表对它必灭亡的觉知。</p>

Verses 32-34. For thy servant became surety for the boy from being with my father, saying, If I bring him not back unto thee I shall sin to my father all the days. And now I pray let thy servant remain 
instead of the boy a servant to my lord, and let the boy go up with his brethren. For how shall I go up to my father and the boy be not with me? peradventure I shall see the evil that shall come upon 
my father. "For thy servant became surety for the boy from being with my father, saying," signifies adjunction to itself; "If I bring him not back unto thee," signifies unless it be conjoined with 
spiritual good; "I shall sin to my father all the days," signifies a turning away, and thus that there would be no good of the church; "and now I pray let thy servant remain instead of the boy a servant 
to my lord," signifies submission; "and let the boy go up with his brethren," signifies in order that interior truth may be conjoined with spiritual good; "for how shall I go up to my father and the 
boy he not with me?" signifies that spiritual good from the natural would be without interior truth; "peradventure I shall see the evil that shall come upon my father," signifies perception that it 
will perish. </p>

Verses 32-34 For your servant became surety for the boy to my father, saying, If I do not bring him back to you I shall be sinning against my father all my days. And now, I beg you, let your servant 
stay instead of the boy, a slave to my lord; and let the boy go up with his brothers. For how am I to go up to my father, and the boy is not with me? Perhaps I shall see the evil which will come upon 
my father.  </p>
<p>'For your servant became surety for the boy to my father, saying' means an attachment to itself. 'If I do not bring him back to you' means unless it is joined to spiritual good. 'I shall 
be sinning against my father all my days' means a turning away, as a result of which the good of the Church ceases to exist. 'And now, I beg you, let your servant stay instead of the boy, a slave to 
my lord' means submission. 'And let the boy go up with his brothers' means in order that interior truth may be joined to spiritual good. 'For how am I to go up to my father, and the boy is not with 
me?' means that spiritual good from the natural would be without interior truth. 'Perhaps I shall see the evil which will come upon my father' means a perception that it will perish. </p>

Vers. 32-34.  Quia servus tuus spospondit pro puero a cum patre {1}meo, dicendo, Si non reduxero illum ad te, et peccabo patri meo omnibus diebus. Et nunc maneat quaeso servus tuus loco pueri servus 
 domino meo, et puer ascendat cum fratribus suis. Quia quomodo ascendam ad patrem meum et puer non ille cum me, forte videro malum quod inveniet patrem meum. `Quia servus tuus spospondit pro puero a 
cum patre meo, dicendo' significat adjunctionem sibi: `Si non reduxero illum  ad te' significat nisi conjungatur bono spirituali: `et peccabo patri meo omnibus diebus' significat aversionem, et sic quod 
(x)nullum Ecclesiae bonum: `et nunc maneat quaeso servus tuus loco pueri servus domino meo' significat submissionem: `et puer ascendat cum fratribus suis' significat ut verum interius bono spirituali 
conjungatur: `quia quomodo ascendam ad patrem meum et puer non ille cum me' significat quod bonum spirituale e naturali absque vero interiore: `forte  videro  malum  quod  inveniet  patrem  meum'  
significat apperceptionem quod peribit. @1 suo I here only$ </p>
