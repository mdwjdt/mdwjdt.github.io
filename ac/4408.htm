<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4408.</strong>眼睛的视觉与理解力之间存在对应关系，这对那些反思的人来说是显而易见的；因为世上的物体全都从阳光获得某种事物，并通过眼睛进入，将自己储存在记忆里。它们将自己作为这些物体的视觉形像存放在那里；因为人通过记忆所回想的事物会从内在被他看到。这就是人之想象的源头，其概念被哲学家们称为物质概念。当人在自己里面更内在地看到这些物体时，它们会使自己呈现为思维，还会呈现为某种视觉形像，只是更精纯；其概念被称为非物质的，以及思想的。很明显，含有生命，因而含有聪明和智慧的内在之光是存在的，这光照亮内在视觉，并与那些通过外在视觉进入的印象会合；而且，内在之光照凭尘世之光出现在那里的事物被布置的方式而起作用。通过听觉进入的事物也从内在转化为类似由尘世之光所形成的视觉形像的形式。</p>

That there is a correspondence of the sight of the eye with intellectual sight, plainly appears to those who reflect; for the objects of the world, all of which derive something from the light of the 
sun, enter through the eye, and bestow themselves in the memory, and this evidently under a like visual figure, for whatever is produced therefrom is seen inwardly. This is the source of man's imagination, 
the ideas of which are called by philosophers material ideas. When these objects appear still more interiorly they present thought, and this also under some visual figure, but more pure, the ideas 
of which are called immaterial, and also intellectual. That there is an interior light, in which there is life, and consequently intelligence and wisdom, and that this light illumines the interior 
sight, and meets the things which have entered in through the external sight, is very evident; and also that the interior light operates according to the disposition of the things present there from 
the light of the world. The things that enter through the hearing are also inwardly turned into forms like those of the visual images that come from the light of the world. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4408</b></p><p><b>4408.</b>
The existence of a correspondence between the sight of the eye and that of the understanding is perfectly plain to those who stop to reflect, since the objects that make up the world, each of which derives 
something from the light of the sun, come in through the eye and store themselves in the memory. They deposit themselves there as visual impressions of those objects, for the things which a person 
recalls from the memory are seen inwardly by him. They are the source of man's formation of mental images, whose constituent ideas philosophers term material ideas. And when a person sees these objects 
even more inwardly within himself they present themselves as thought, doing so again as something like visual impressions, though purer ones, whose constituent ideas are called immaterial, and also 
intellectual. The existence of an interior light holding life, and therefore intelligence and wisdom, within it, which provides the light for the interior sight and meets those impressions which have 
come in through the external sight, is plainly evident, as also is the fact that the action of the interior light is dependent on the way in which things that are present there from the light of the 
world are deployed. The things which come in through hearing are also converted inwardly into impressions similar to the visual ones which are formed from the light of the world. </p>

</p><b>4408.</b>
Quod correspondentia visus ocularis sit cum visu intellectuali, apparet manifeste illis qui reflectunt; objecta enim mundi quae omnia trahunt aliquid ex luce solis, per oculum intrant et se reponunt 
in memoria, et hoc evidenter {1} sub specie visuali simili, nam quae inde reproducuntur, videntur intus; inde imaginatio hominis, cujus ideae a philosophis vocantur ideae materiales; haec objecta 
cum adhuc interius apparent, sistunt cogitationem, et hoc quoque sub aliqua specie visuali sed puriore, et hujus ideae appellantur immateriales, tum intellectuales: quod lux interior sit in qua 
vita, proinde intelligentia et sapientia, quae illuminat visum interiorem, et occurrit illis quae intrarunt per visum externum {2}, luculenter {3} patet; tum quod lux interior operetur secundum dispositionem 
rerum quae a luce mundi ibi sunt.  (o)Quae per auditum intrant, vertuntur etiam intus in species similes visualium, quae sunt ex luce mundi.      @1 manifeste$      @2 ip et auditum$  
    @3 evidenter$ </p>
