<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2549节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2549.</strong>创世记20:10，11.亚比米勒又对亚伯拉罕说，你见了什么才作这事呢？亚伯拉罕说，因为我说，这地方的人总不惧怕神，必为我妻子的缘故杀我。<br />“亚比米勒又对亚伯拉罕说”表出于信之教义的进一步的思维。“你见了什么才作这事呢”表追查原因。“亚伯拉罕说”表作为答复的直觉。“因为我说，这地方的人总不惧怕神”表源于这种直觉的思维：他们在当时所处的状态下不会尊重属灵的真理。“必为我妻子的缘故杀我”表若他们认为唯独属灵的真理能与属天的良善结合，那么信的属天事物也会因此灭亡。</p>

Verses 10, 11. And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou that thou hast done this word? And Abraham said, Because I said, Surely there is no fear of God in this place, and they will kill me on 
account of the word of my wife. "Abimelech said unto Abraham," signifies further thought from the doctrine of faith; "what sawest thou that thou hast done this word?" signifies a looking into the cause; 
"Abraham said," signifies a perception which is an answer; "because I said surely there is no fear of God in this place," signifies thought thence derived: that they would have no respect for spiritual 
truth in the state in which they were; "and they will kill me on account of the word of my wife," signifies that the celestial things of faith would thus also perish if they were to think that 
spiritual truth alone could be conjoined with celestial good. </p>

Verses 10, 11 And Abimelech said to Abraham, What did you see, that you have done this thing? And Abraham said, Because I said, Surely there is no fear of God in this place, and they will kill me on 
account of my wife. </p>
<p>'Abimelech said to Abraham' means further thought from the doctrine of faith. 'What did you see, that you have done this thing?' means a looking into the cause. 'Abraham said' means 
a perception, which constituted a reply. 'Because I said, Surely there is no fear of God in this place' means the thought derived from this that men would have no respect for spiritual truth in that 
state in which they were then. 'And they will kill me on account of my wife' means that this being so celestial things of faith would perish also if they were to think that spiritual truth alone could 
be joined to celestial good. </p>

Vers. 10, 11.  Et dixit Abimelech ad Abrahamum, Quid vidisti quod feceris verbum hoc? Et dixit Abraham, Quia dixi, Verum tamen nullus timor Dei in loco hoc, et occident me propter verbum uxoris meae. 
`Dixit Abimelech ad Abrahamum' significat ulteriorem cogitationem ex doctrina fidei: `Quid vidisti quod feceris verbum hoc?' significat intuitionem in causam: `dixit Abraham' significat perceptionem 
quae responsum: `Quia dixi, Verumtamen nullus timor Dei in loco hoc' significat cogitationem inde quod nullum respectum haberent veri spiritualis in (o)eo statu in quo sunt: `et occident me propter verbum 
uxoris meae' significat quod sic caelestia fidei quoque perirent si cogitarent quod solum spirituale verum conjungi potuisse caelesti bono. </p>
