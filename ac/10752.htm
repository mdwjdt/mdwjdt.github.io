<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10752节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10752</strong>.与我同在的传教士根本不相信除了我们自己的星球外还有其它星球的存在。因为他在世时以为主只出生在地球上，没有主就没有救赎。因此，他被带入一种状态，类似这些灵人如世人那样出现在自己星球上时所进入的状态，就是刚才所描述的那种状态；在这种状态下，他被送回那个星球，以便他不仅看到它，还与那里的居民交谈。这一切完成后，我也被恩准以同样的方式交流，好叫我能以同样的方式看见这些居民，以及这个星球上的一些事物。灵人和天使能与世人交谈，无论他们说哪种语言，因为他们的思维会进入世人的观念，从而进入他们所说的话中。 </p>

The preacher who was with me did not at all believe that there are other earths besides our own, for the reason that in the world he had thought that the Lord was born on this earth only, and that without 
the Lord there is no salvation. He was therefore reduced into a state similar to that of these spirits when they appear in their own earth as men (of which just above), and in this state he was 
let into that earth, so that he not only saw it but also spoke with the inhabitants there. When this was done, communication was given me also in the same way, so that I too saw the inhabitants, and also 
some things upon that earth. Spirits and angels can speak with men of any language; because their thought falls into the ideas of the men, and thus into the words of their speech. </p>

The preacher who was with me had no belief at all in the existence of planets other than our own, because in the world he had thought that the Lord was born solely on this planet and that without the 
Lord there was no salvation. He was therefore brought into a state like the one spirits enter when they appear on their planet as people - the one described above - and was then sent to that planet, 
not only to see it but also to talk to the inhabitants there. When this had been done, communication from there was granted to me as well in order that I might in a similar way behold those inhabitants 
and also some things on that planet. Spirits and angels can talk to people, whatever language they speak, because their thought passes into the ideas in people's minds and so into the words they speak.  </p>

Praedicator qui mecum erat prorsus non credebat quod aliae tellures darentur quam nostra, ex causa quia {1}cogitaverat in mundo quod Dominus solum in hac tellure natus sit, et absque Domino nulla salus; 
quapropter redactus est in similem statum in {2}quem spiritus quando apparent in tellure sua sicut homines, de quo mox supra, et sic missus in tellurem illam, ut non modo videret eam, sed etiam loqueretur 
cum incolis ibi; quo facto, dabatur etiam communicatio inde mecum, ut similiter viderem incolas, et quoque aliqua super tellure illa.  Spiritus et angeli loqui possunt cum hominibus cujuscumque 
linguae, cadit enim cogitatio eorum in ideas hominum, et sic in voces loquelae {3}eorum. @1 cogitavit$ @2 quo sunt$ @3 d eorum i hominum$ </p>
