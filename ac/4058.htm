<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4058节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4058.</strong>马太福音24章的头几节描述了教会的逐渐毁灭，即：首先，人们开始不知道何为良善与真理，相反却开始针对它们彼此争论；第二个阶段，他们藐视它们；第三个阶段，他们发自内心不承认它们；第四个阶段，他们亵渎它们。这几个阶段就是本章3-22节所论述的主题。由于信之真理和仁之良善仍存留在中心，也就是一些所谓的“选民”当中，所以23-28节描述了那时信之真理的状态，接下来要解释的这几节则描述了仁与爱之良善的状态，以及一个新教会的开始。</p>

In the foregoing verses of this chapter of Matthew there is described the successive vastation of the church; namely, that first they began not to know what good and truth are, but disputed about them; 
next that they treated them with contempt; in the third place that they did not acknowledge them at heart; and fourthly, that they profaned them. These states are described from the third to the twenty-second 
verse; and as the truth of faith and the good of charity were still to remain in the midst (that is, with some who are called the "elect") the quality of the state of the truth of faith at 
that time is described in verses 23 to 28; and in the following verses, now to be explained, there is described the state of the good that is of charity and of love; and also the beginning of a New Church. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4058</b></p><p><b>4058.</b>
The subject in previous verses of this chapter in Matthew has been the progressive ruination of the Church, which took place as follows: First of all people ceased to know what good or truth was, and 
instead began to argue with one another about these. In a second phase they treated them with contempt; in a third they did not in their hearts acknowledge them; and in a fourth they profaned them. These 
phases were the subject in verses 3-22 of this chapter. And because the truth of faith and the good of love would continue to exist at the centre, that is, with some called 'the elect', the state 
of the truth of faith as this will be at that time is dealt with in verses 23-28, and the state of the good of charity and love as that will be then, and also the beginning of a new Church, are dealt 
with in the verses which have just been quoted [in <a href="4056.htm">4056</a>]. </p>

Actum est in illis quae praecedunt in hoc capite apud Matthaeum, de successiva vastatione Ecclesiae, quod nempe primum non inciperent scire quid bonum et verum sed litigarent de illis; </p>
<p>secundo quod 
contemnerent illa; tertio quod non corde agnoscerent; </p>
<p>quarto quod profanarent; de his actum est in illo capite a vers. 3 ad 22; et quia adhuc permansurum verum fidei et bonum charitatis, in medio 
seu apud quosdam qui electi {1} vocantur, agitur de statu veri quod fide: qualis tunc erit, a versu 23 ad 28, et de statu boni quod est charitatis et amoris, in his versibus qui nunc allati sunt; 
tum quoque de initio novae Ecclesiae.      @1 i ibi$ </p>
