<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10454节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10454</strong>.“约书亚听见百姓呼喊的噪音”表对这个民族的内层品质的深思和辨别。这从“听见”和“百姓呼喊的噪音”的含义，以及“约书亚”的代表清楚可知：“听见”是指深思和辨别，因为现在论述的主题是这个民族内心里的品质，因而是指他们内层的品质；“约书亚”是指深思和辨别的圣言真理，因为他是摩西的助手，而摩西代表圣言，如前所示，所以他的助手代表真理，因为所有真理都属于圣言，在此是指深思、审查和辨别的真理；“百姓呼喊的噪音”是指这个民族内心里的品质，因而是指他们内层的品质。在圣言中，“噪音”（noise或voice，或译为嗓音、响声）表示内在的声音，也就是思维，因而是指内层在真理或虚假方面的品质，因为思维是由这一个或那一个产生的（参看<a href="219.htm">219</a>，<a href="220.htm">220</a>，<a href="3563.htm">3563</a>，<a href="7573.htm">7573</a>，<a href="8813.htm">8813</a>，<a href="9926.htm">9926</a>节）。但“呼喊”表示声音的表达，无论是说话的、唱歌的还是喊叫的，它是从思维或内在的声音发出的。因此，“听见呼喊的噪音”表示从表明它的声音辨别内层的品质。因为语气或声音，无论说话的，唱歌的，还是呼喊的，都是从内在的情感和思维发出的，这二者存在于声音里面，还被那些倾听并思想它的人辨别出来；例如，可以看出它是发怒、威胁，还是友好、温和、喜乐、忧郁等等。在来世，这种辨别如此敏锐，以致天使从任何人刚说出一句话的声音就能辨别出他的内层是何品质。这就是“听见百姓呼喊的噪音”所表示的。</p>

And Joshua heard the voice of the people in their shouting. That this signifies survey and taking notice in respect to the quality of the interiors of that nation, is evident from the signification of 
"hearing," as being survey and taking notice, for the subject now treated of is that nation in respect to its quality interiorly, thus in respect to the quality of its interiors; from the representation 
of Joshua, as being the truth of the Word surveying and taking notice, for he was the minister of Moses, and by Moses was represented the Word (as was shown above), consequently by the minister is 
represented truth, for all truth is of the Word, here truth surveying, exploring, and taking notice; and from the signification of "the voice of the people in their shouting," as being what was the 
quality of that nation interiorly, thus what was the quality of its interiors. For by "voice" in the Word is signified interior voice, which is thought, consequently the interior quality in respect to 
truth or falsity, because thought is from the one or the other (see n. 219, 220, 3563, 7573, 8813, 9926). But by "shouting" is signified what is articulate of sound, whether of speech, or of singing, 
or of shouting, that proceeds from the thought, which is the interior voice. Therefore by "hearing the voice in their shouting" is signified a taking notice, from the sound as an index, in respect to 
the quality of the interiors. For the tone, or sound, whether of speech, or of singing, or of shouting, proceeds from the interior affection and thought; these are both in the sound, and are also noticed 
by those who attend and reflect; as for example whether it is angry, threatening, friendly, gentle, glad, mournful, and so forth. In the other life this is perceived so exquisitely that from the 
sound of one word the angels perceive what the quality of anyone is in respect to his interiors. This then is what is signified by "hearing the voice of the people in their shouting." </p>

'And Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted' means contemplating and discerning what the interiors of that nation were like. This is clear from the meaning of 'hearing' as contemplating 
and discerning, for the subject now is what that nation was like inwardly, thus what their interiors were like; from the representation of 'Joshua' as the truth of the Word contemplating and discerning 
(he was Moses' minister, and Moses represented the Word, as shown above, so that his minister represents truth, for all truth belongs to the Word, at this point truth that contemplates, examines, and 
discerns); and from the meaning of 'the noise of the people as they shouted' as what that nation was like inwardly, thus what their interiors were like. In the Word 'noise' or 'voice' means the inner 
voice, which is thought, consequently what the interiors are like as regards either truth or falsity, for the one or the other gives rise to the thought, see <a href="219.htm">219</a>, <a href="220.htm">220</a>, <a href="3563.htm">3563</a>, <a href="7573.htm">7573</a>, <a href="8813.htm">8813</a>, <a href="9926.htm">9926</a>. But 'shouting' 
means the utterance of sound, whether that of speaking, singing, or crying out, which emanates from thought or the inner voice. So it is that 'hearing the noise of shouting' means discerning 
what the interiors are like from the sound that indicates it. For the sound, whether that of speaking, singing, or crying out, emanates from inner affection and thought, both of which are present within 
the sound and are also discerned by those who listen to it and think about it, to see for example whether it is angry, threatening, friendly, gentle, joyful, gloomy, and so on. In the next life such 
discernment is so sharp that angels can discern what someone's interiors are like from the sound of just one of the words he uses. This then is what 'hearing the noise of the people as they shouted' 
is used to mean.  </p>

`Et audivit Joschua vocem populi in vociferatione ejus': quod significet lustrationem et apperceptionem qualia interiora illius gentis erant, constat ex significatione `audire' quod sit lustratio et 
apperceptio, agitur enim nunc de illa gente qualis {1}erat interius, ita qualia interiora ejus; ex repraesentatione `Joschuae' quod sit verum Verbi lustrans et appercipiens {2}; {3}{4}erat enim ille 
minister Moschis, et per Moschen {5}repraesentabatur Verbum, ut supra ostensum est, inde per ministrum ejus repraesentatur verum, nam omne verum est Verbi, hic verum lustrans, explorans, et appercipiens; 
ex significatione `vocis populi in vociferatione ejus' quod sit qualis esset gens illa interius, {6}ita qualia interiora ejus; per `vocem' enim in Verbo significatur vox interior, quae est cogitatio, 
inde quale interius quoad verum aut falsum, nam ex hoc aut illo est cogitatio, videatur n. 219, 220, 3563, 7573, 8813, 9926; per `vociferationem' autem significatur articulatum soni, sive {7}loquelae 
sit, sive cantus, sive {8}clamoris, quod ex cogitatione, quae est vox interior, procedit; inde per `audire vocem in vociferatione' significatur apperceptio qualia interiora sunt, ex sono ut indice; 
sonus enim sive loquelae sit, sive cantus, sive clamoris, procedit ex interiore affectione et cogitatione, haec et illa insunt sono, et quoque appercipiuntur ab illis qui attendunt et reflectunt; ut 
pro exemplo, si iracundum sit, si minans, si amicum, si clemens, si {9} laetum, si {10} lugubre, et sic porro; in altera vita tam exquisite ut ex sono unius vocis {11}appercipiatur ab angelis qualis
