<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6974节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6974.</strong>“也不听你的声音”表他们若没有任何遵从的迹象。这从“听”和“声音”的含义，以及摩西的代表清楚可知：“听”是指遵从（参看<a href="2542.htm">2542</a>，<a href="3869.htm">3869</a>，<a href="5017.htm">5017</a>节）；“声音”是指所宣告和预先声明的（<a href="6971.htm">6971</a>，<a href="6972.htm">6972</a>节）；摩西（他们要听他的“声音”）是指神性律法，也就是神性真理，因而圣言方面的主，因为圣言里面有神性真理。由此明显可知，他们“也不听你的声音”表示他们若没有任何遵从的迹象。本节和前面1、8节经文说“他们若不信你”，“他们若不听”，然而这两句话看上去差不多一样，因为不信的人也不会听。但这二者是有区别的，因为表示拥有信的“信”论及信之真理，因而涉及心智的理解力部分；而表示遵从的“听”论及仁之良善，因而涉及意愿部分。事实上，在圣言中，尤其在先知书部分，真理是以它自己的话语来表达的；良善也是以它自己的话语来表达的，这是由于天上的婚姻，也就是良善与真理的婚姻存在于圣言的每一个细节中（参看<a href="683.htm">683</a>，<a href="793.htm">793</a>，<a href="801.htm">801</a>，<a href="2173.htm">2173</a>，<a href="2516.htm">2516</a>，<a href="2712.htm">2712</a>，<a href="4138.htm">4138</a>，<a href="6343.htm">6343</a>节）。</p>

And do not hear thy voice. That this signifies if they do not yield any obedience, is evident from the signification of "hearing," as being obedience (see n. 2542, 3869, 5017); from the signification 
of "voice," as being what is announced and foretold (n. 6971, 6972); and from the representation of Moses, whose voice they were to hear, as being the Lord as to the Divine law, that is, as to the Divine 
truth, thus as to the Word, for therein is Divine truth. Hence it is plain that by the expression, "if they do not hear thy voice," is signified, if they do not yield any obedience. In this passage 
and before (verses 1 and 8), it is said "if they do not believe," and "if they do not hear," and yet the two expressions appear alike, for he who does not believe, does not hear. Yet they are distinct, 
for "believing," by which is signified faith, is said of the truth of faith, and thus relates to the intellectual; but "hearing," by which is signified obeying, is said of the good of charity, and 
thus relates to the will. For in the Word, especially the prophetic, where truth is expressed in its own words; good is also expressed in its own words, on account of the heavenly marriage, which is 
the marriage of good and of truth, in every detail of the Word (see n. 683, 793, 801, 2173, 2516, 2712, 4138, 6343). </p>

'And do not hear your voice' means if they show no sign of obedience either. This is clear from the meaning of 'hearing' as obedience, dealt with in <a href="2542.htm">2542</a>, <a href="3869.htm">3869</a>, <a href="5017.htm">5017</a>; from the meaning of 'the voice' 
as that which has been declared and that which has been declared before-hand, dealt with in <a href="6971.htm">6971</a>, <a href="6972.htm">6972</a>; and from the representation of Moses, whose 'voice' they were to hear, as the Lord in respect of 
Divine Law, that is, Divine Truth, thus in respect of the Word since that is where Divine Truth is. From all this it is evident that 'if they do not hear your voice' means if they show no sign of obedience 
either. The present verse, and verses 1 and <a href="8.htm">8</a> above, use the expressions 'if they do not believe' and 'if they do not hear', when yet both expressions seem to be much the same as each other, for 
one ,ho does not believe does not hear either. But the two are distinct from each other, for 'believing', which means [being in possession of] faith, is used with regard to truth which is the substance 
of faith, and so has reference to the understanding part of the mind, whereas 'hearing', which means obeying, is used with regard to good which is the substance of charity, and so has reference to 
the will part. For in the Word, especially the prophetical part, where truth is described by means of expressions particularly its own, so also is good described by means of those particularly its own, 
because of the heavenly marriage within each detail of the Word, which is a marriage of goodness and truth, see <a href="683.htm">683</a>, <a href="793.htm">793</a>, <a href="801.htm">801</a>, <a href="2173.htm">2173</a>, <a href="2516.htm">2516</a>, <a href="2712.htm">2712</a>, <a href="4138.htm">4138</a> (end), <a href="6343.htm">6343</a>. </p>

`Et non audiunt vocem tuam': quod significet si nec aliquid oboedientiae praestant, constat ex significatione `audire' quod sit oboedientia, de qua n. 2542, 3869, 5017; ex significatione `vocis' quod 
sit annuntiatum et praenuntiatum, de qua n. 6971, 6972; et ex repraesentatione `Moschis' cujus vocem audirent, quod sit Dominus quoad Divinam Legem, hoc est, quoad Divinum Verum, ita quoad Verbum, nam 
ibi est Divinum Verum; inde patet quod per `si non audiunt vocem tuam' significetur si nec aliquid oboedientiae praestant {1}.  Hic et prius in vers. 1 et 8 dicitur `si non credunt' et `si non audiunt,' 
{2}et tamen utrumque simile apparet, nam qui non credit, is nec audit', sed distincta sunt, nam `credere,' per quod significatur fides, dicitur de vero quod est fidei, ac ita se refert ad intellectuale; 
`audire' autem, per quod significatur oboedire, dicitur de bono quod est charitatis, ac ita se refert ad voluntarium; in Verbo enim, imprimis prophetico, ubi verum exprimitur suis vocibus, etiam 
bonum exprimitur suis, ob conjugium caeleste in singulis Verbi, quod conjugium est boni et veri, videatur n. 683, 793, 801, 2173, 2516, 2712, 4138 fin., 6343. 	@1 i annuntiatio$ 	@2 tametsi unum
