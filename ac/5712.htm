<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5712节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5712.</strong>说这些事是叫人们知道，就连疾病也与灵界有对应关系。只是它们与天堂，即大人没有对应关系，而是与处在对立面的人，因而与地狱里的人有对应关系。从普遍意义上说，灵界既指天堂，也指地狱；因为当人死亡时，他便离开自然界进入灵界。疾病之所以与地狱里的人有对应关系，是因为它们对应于低层心智的恶欲和激情，这些欲望和激情就是那些疾病的根源；一般来说，疾病的根源就是各种各样的放纵、自身享受或奢侈享受，纯粹的肉体快感，以及嫉妒、仇恨、报复、淫荡等等的感觉，它们会摧毁人的内层。一旦这些内层被摧毁，外层就会受苦，并将人拖入疾病，从而置他于死地。在教会，众所周知，人的死亡是邪恶的后果，或是由于罪；疾病也一样，因为这些是带来死亡者。由此可见，就连疾病也与灵界有对应关系，不过是与灵界的不洁之物有对应关系；因为疾病本身是不洁的。如前所述，它们来源于不洁之物。</p>

These things have been said in order that it may be known that diseases also have correspondence with the spiritual world; not a correspondence with heaven, which is the Grand Man, but with those who 
are in what is opposite, thus with those who are in the hells. By the spiritual world in the universal sense is meant both heaven and hell; for when man dies he passes out of the natural into the spiritual 
world. That diseases have correspondence with such is because they correspond to the cupidities and passions of the lower mind, which are also their origins; for the origins of diseases are, in 
general, intemperance, luxury of various kinds, mere bodily pleasures, as also feelings of envy, hatred, revenge, lewdness, and the like, which destroy man's interiors; and when these are destroyed the 
exteriors suffer, and drag man into disease, and so into death. It is known in the church that the death of man is from evils, or on account of sin; and it is the same with diseases, for these belong 
to death. From all this it is evident that even diseases have correspondence with the spiritual world, but with unclean things there; for diseases are in themselves unclean, because as before said 
they spring from unclean things. </p>

All this has been stated so that people may know that even sicknesses have a correspondence with the spiritual world. They do not have a correspondence with heaven, which is the Grand Man, but with those 
in a contrary place, thus with those in hell. The expression spiritual world is used in an all-embracing sense to mean both heaven and hell; for when a person dies he passes from the natural world 
into the spiritual world. The reason sicknesses have a correspondence with those in hell is that sicknesses correspond to the evil desires and cravings of the lower mind (animus), and these desires 
and cravings are the origins of those sicknesses, the origins of sicknesses in general being various kinds of intemperance and self-gratification, wholly physical pleasures, as well as feelings of envy, 
hatred, revenge, lust, and the like, which destroy a person's interiors. Once these are destroyed his exteriors suffer and subject him to sickness and so to death. The fact that human death is the 
result of evils or due to sin is well known in the Church; so too are sicknesses, for these are bringers of death. From all this it may be seen that sicknesses too have a correspondence with the spiritual 
world, with the forms of uncleanness there; for essentially sicknesses are forms of uncleanness. As stated above, they have their origin in uncleanness. </p>

</p><b>5712.</b>
Haec dicta sunt ut sciatur quod etiam morbi correspondentiam habeant cum mundo spirituali; non correspondentiam cum caelo, {1}quod est Maximus Homo, sed cum illis qui in opposito sunt, ita cum illis 
qui in infernis; per mundum spiritualem in universali sensu intelligitur et caelum et infernum, homo enim cum moritur, transit e mundo naturali in mundum spiritualem.  Quod morbi correspondentiam habeant 
cum illis, est quia morbi correspondent cupiditatibus et passionibus animi, hae quoque sunt origines illorum; origines enim morborum in communi sunt intemperantiae, luxuriae varii generis, voluptates 
mere corporeae, tum quoque invidiae, odia, vindictae, lasciviae et similia, quae interiora hominis destruunt, quibus destructis exteriora patiuntur et in morbum trahunt hominem, et sic in mortem; 
quod mors homini sit ex malis, seu propter peccatum, notum est in Ecclesia, ita quoque morbi, nam hi sunt mortis.  Ex his constare potest quod etiam morbi correspondentiam habeant cum mundo spirituali, 
sed cum immundis ibi, nam morbi in se immundi sunt, scaturiunt enim ab immundis, ut supra dictum. @1 qui$ </p>
