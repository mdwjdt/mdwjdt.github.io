<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2590节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2590.</strong>我从多方面得到指教，外邦人若过着道德、顺从、彼此仁爱的生活，并根据自己的宗教信仰接受某种良知，在来世也被接纳。在那里，天使们怀着急切地渴望和关切教导他们信的良善与真理。他们在被教导的过程中，表现得谦逊、聪明和智慧，能轻易接受并吸收教导给他们的东西。因为他们没有形成与信之真理相反、必须被驱散的任何观念，更没有形成接受主的任何障碍，不象很多过着邪恶生活的基督徒。而且，这样的外邦人不仇恨他人，或因为受到伤害而报复，或图谋诡诈。他们甚至会祝愿基督徒；而另一方面，基督徒却看不起他们，并尽可能地向他们施暴。不过，主会把他们从那些基督徒的无情对待中解救出来，并给予保护。<br />基督徒和外邦人在来世的情况是这样：承认信之真理，同时过着良善生活的基督徒会先于外邦人被接纳；但如今这样的基督徒寥寥无几。然而，外邦人若过着顺从和彼此仁爱的生活，会先于所过的生活不怎么良善的基督徒被接纳。因为在全世界，凡过着良善生活的人都会在主的怜悯下被接纳并得救；接受真理的，是良善本身。生活中的良善就是接受种子，即接受真理的土地本身；而生活中的罪恶绝不可能接受它。虽然那些沉浸于罪恶中的人得到上千种不同方式的教导，甚至接受最充分的教导，但信之真理在他们那里只能进入记忆，无法渗透到内心情感中。因此，在来世，他们记忆中的真理会被驱散，变得无效。</p>

I have been instructed in many ways that Gentiles who have led a moral life, and have been obedient, and have lived in mutual charity, and have received some sort of conscience according to their religion, 
are accepted in the other life, and are there instructed by angels with anxious care in the goods and truths of faith. While receiving instruction they conduct themselves modestly, intelligently, 
and wisely, and easily receive and become imbued with the instruction; for they have formed for themselves no principles contrary to the truths of faith that have to be dispersed, still less stumbling-blocks 
against the Lord; as have many Christians who have led a life of evil. Moreover such do not hate others, nor avenge injuries, nor plot artifices and deceits. Nay, they wish well to Christians; 
although on the other hand Christians despise them and even do them violence so far as they can; but they are withdrawn by the Lord from their unmercifulness, and are protected. [2] For the case 
of Christians and Gentiles in the other life is such that Christians who have acknowledged the truths of faith, and have at the same time led a life of good, are received in preference to Gentiles; although 
at the present day such are few; but Gentiles who have lived in obedience and mutual charity are received in preference to Christians who have not led so good a life. For in the wide world all 
those who have lived in good are of the Lord's mercy received and saved; for good is that which receives truth. The good of life is the very ground for the seed, that is, for the truth. Evil of life cannot 
possibly receive it, for although such as are in evil be instructed in a thousand ways, nay, even if they become most fully instructed, nevertheless the truths of faith enter no further with them 
than into the memory, and do not penetrate to the affection which is of the heart; and therefore in the other life their truths of memory are dissipated, and become null and void. </p>

I have been taught in many ways that gentiles who have led a morally correct life and have been obedient ones, who have led charitable lives one with another, and have received some kind of conscience 
in keeping with their religion, are accepted in the next life, where with anxious desire and care angels instruct them in the goods and truths of faith. While they are being instructed they behave in 
an unassuming, intelligent, and wise manner, receiving and taking in what they are taught with ease. For they have not formed for themselves any ideas which are contrary to the truths of faith and need 
to be dispelled, still less any obstacles to the Lord, as with so many Christians who have led a life of evil. What is more, such gentiles do not hate others, or seek revenge for injuries, or plan 
devices and deceits. Rather, they wish well to Christians, even when Christians for their part despise them and so far as they are able do them violence. But they are rescued by the Lord from the merciless 
ways of those Christians and are protected by Him. For the situation with Christians and gentiles in the next life is that Christians who have acknowledged the truths of faith and at the same time 
have led a life of goodness are received ahead of gentiles; but such at the present day are few. Gentiles however who have led obedient and charitable lives one with another are received ahead of 
Christians who have not led so good a life. For everyone throughout the whole world who has led a good life is in the Lord's mercy received and saved; for good itself is that which receives truth. Good 
in a person's life is the ground itself for the seed, that is, for the truth, but evil in his life cannot possibly receive it. Although those immersed in evil are taught in a thousand different ways, 
indeed even if they are fully taught, the truths of faith with them still do not advance beyond the memory and do not penetrate through to the affection, which is in the heart. Consequently in the next 
life truths present in their memory are dispersed and cease to have any real existence. </p>

Multis instructus sum quod gentiles qui moratam egerunt vitam, ac oboedientes fuerunt, inque charitate mutua vixerunt, ac secundum religiosum suum acceperunt instar conscientiae, in altera vita accepti 
sint, ac ibi cum sollicita cum ab angelis instruantur in bonis et veris fidei; illi cum instruuntur, modeste, intelligenter et sapienter se gerunt, et facile recipiunt, et imbuuntur, nulla enim principia 
contra vera fidei sibi formarunt quae discutienda, minus scandala contra Dominum, sicut plures Christiani qui vitam mali egerunt; praeterea tales non odio habent alios, non vindicant injurias, 
nec machinationes et dolos nectunt, immo Christianis bene volunt, cum vicissim hi illos contemnunt, etiam quantum possunt, violant, sed eximuntur eorum immisericordiae a Domino et tutantur.  [2] Ita 
enim se cum Christianis et gentilibus habet in altera vita quod Christiani qui agnoverunt vera fidei, et simul vitam boni egerunt, prae gentilibus recipiantur, sed tales hodie pauci sunt; gentiles autem 
qui in oboedientia et charitate mutua vixerunt, recipiantur prae Christianis qui non ita bonam vitam egerunt. Omnes enim illi in universo terrarum orbe, ex misericordia Domini, recipiuntur et salvantur 
qui in bono vixerunt, ipsum enim bonum est quod recipit verum; bonum vitae est ipsa humus seminis, hoc est, veri; malum vitae nusquam recipit; quamvis illi qui in malo sunt, instruerentur mille modis, 
immo tametsi instructissimi fierent, usque tamen vera fidei apud eos non ultra vadunt quam in memoriam, nec penetrant ad affectionem quae cordis; quare etiam vera illorum memoriae dissipantur, et 
nulla fiunt in altera vita. </p>
