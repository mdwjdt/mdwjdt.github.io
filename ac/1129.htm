Some account of the antediluvians who perished follows at the end of this chapter.    CHAPTER 10.      1. And these are the nativities of the sons of Noah: Shem, Ham, and Japheth: and unto them were 
sons born after the flood.      2. The sons of Japheth: Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.      3. And the sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.  
    4. And the sons of Javan: Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.      5. From these were spread abroad the isles of the nations in their lands, everyone according to his tongue, according 
to their families, as to their nations.      6. And the sons of Ham: Cush, and Mizraim, and Put, and Canaan.      7. And the sons of Cush: Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabteca. 
And the sons of Raamah: Sheba, and Dedan.      8. And Cush begat Nimrod. He began to be a mighty one in the earth.      9. He was mighty in hunting before Jehovah; wherefore it was said, As Nimrod, 
mighty in hunting before Jehovah.      10. And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.      11. Out of that land went forth Asshur, and built 
Nineveh, and the city of Rehoboth, and Calah.      12. And Resen, between Nineveh and Calah; this is that great city.      13. And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim.    
  14. And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, from whom went forth the Philistines, and Caphtorim.      15. And Canaan begat Zidon, his firstborn, and Heth.      16. And the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the 
Girgashite.      17. And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite.      18. And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite. And afterwards were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad.  
    19. And the border of the Canaanites was from Zidon, in coming to Gerar, even unto Gaza; in coming to Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboiim, even unto Lasha.      20. These are the sons 
of Ham, according to their families, according to their tongues, in their lands, in their nations.      21. And there was born to Shem also; he is the father of all the sons of Eber; the elder brother 
of Japheth.      22. The sons of Shem: Elam, and Asshur, and Arpachshad, and Lud, and Aram.      23. And the sons of Aram: Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.      24. And Arpachshad begat Shelah; 
and Shelah begat Eber.       25. And unto Eber were born two sons; the name of the one was Peleg, for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name was Joktan.      26. And Joktan begat 
Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah.      27. And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah.      28. And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba.      29. And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab. All these were 
the sons of Joktan.      30. And their dwelling was from Mesha, in coming to Sephar, the mountain of the east.      31. These are the sons of Shem, according to their families, according to their tongues, 
in their lands, according to their nations.      32. These are the families of the sons of Noah, according to their nativities, in their nations; and from these were spread abroad the nations 
in the earth after the flood. </p>

De Antediluvianis qui perierunt, sequitur in fine hujus capitis.           CAPUT X </p>
<p>	1.  Et hae nativitates filiorum Noahi, Shem, Ham, et Japheth; et nati sunt illis filii post diluvium. 	2.  Filii 
Japheti, Gomer, et Magog, et Madai, et Javan, et Tubal, et Meshech, et Tiras. 	3.  Et filii Gomer; Ashkenaz, et Riphath, et Togarmah. 	4.  Et filii Javan; Elishah, et Tarshish, Kittim, et Dodanim. 	5. 
 Ex his dispersae sunt insulae gentium, in terris suis, quaelibet juxta linguam suam, juxta familias suas, quoad gentes suas. 	6.  Et filii Ham; Cush, et Mizraim, et Put, et Canaan. 	7.  Et 
filii Cush; Seba, et Havilah, et Sabtah, et Raamah, et Sabteca.  Et filii Raamae; Sheba, et Dedan. 	8.  Et Cush genuit Nimrodum; is coepit esse potens in terra. 	9.  Is fuit potens venatione coram 
JEHOVAH; propterea dicebatur, Sicut Nimrod potens venatione coram JEHOVAH. 	10.  Et fuit principium regni ejus Babel, et Erech, et Accad, et Calneh, in terra Shinar. 	11.  (x)E terra ista egressus est 
Asshur, et aedificavit Niniven, et Rehoboth urbem, et Calah. 	12.  Et Resen inter Niniven et inter Calah; haec urbs illa magna.  	13.  Et Mizraim genuit Ludim, et Anamim, et Lehabim, et Naphtuhim. 	14. 
 Et Pathrusim, et Casluhim, ex quibus egressi sunt Pelishtim, et Caphtorim. 	15.  Et Canaan genuit Zidonem, primogenitum suum, et Hethum. 	16.  Et Jebusi, et Emori, et Girgashi. 	17.  Et Hivi, 
et Arki, et Sini. 	18.  Et Arvadi, et Zemari, et Hamathi:  et postea dispersae sunt familiae Canaanitarum. 	19.  Et fuit terminus Canaanitarum a Zidone veniendo ad Gerar, usque ad {1}Azzam, veniendo 
ad Sodomam, et {2}Amoram, et Admam, et Zeboim, usque ad Lasha. 	20.  Hi filii Hami, secundum familias suas, secundum linguas suas, in terris eorum, in gentibus eorum. 	21.  Et Shemo natum est 
etiam:  ille pater omnium filiorum Eberi; frater Japheti major. 	22.  Filii Shemi; Elam, et Asshur, et Arpachshad, et Lud, et Aram. 	23.  Et filii Aram; Uz, et Hul, et Gether, et Mash. 	24.  Et Arpachshad 
genuit Shelahum; et Shelah genuit Eberum. 	25.  Et Ebero nati sunt bini filii, nomen unius Peleg, quia in diebus ejus divisa est terra; et nomen fratris ejus Joktan. 	26.  Et Joktan genuit Almodad, 
et Sheleph, et Hazarmaveth, et Jerah. 	27.  Et Hadoram, et Uzal, et Diklah. 	28.  Et Obal, et Abimael, et Sheba. 	29.  Et Ophir, et Havilah, et Jobab; omnes hi filii Joktanis. 	30.  Et fuit 
habitatio eorum a Mesha, veniendo ad Sephar, montem orientis. 	31.  Hi filii Shemi, secundum familias illorum, secundum linguas illorum, in terris illorum, secundum gentes illorum. 	32.  Hae familiae 
filiorum Noahi, secundum nativitates eorum, in gentibus eorum; et ab illis dispersae sunt gentes in terra post diluvium. @1 Heb.    ('azzah)=Gaza.$ @2 Heb.    ('amorah)=Gomorrah.$ </p>
