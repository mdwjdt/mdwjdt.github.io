<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8096节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8096.</strong>“恐怕百姓遇见打仗后悔”表他们会因攻击而偏离真理。这从“后悔”和“打仗”的含义清楚可知：“后悔”是指偏离真理，如下文所述；“打仗”（即战争）是指属灵的争战（参看<a href="1664.htm">1664</a>，<a href="1788.htm">1788</a>，<a href="2686.htm">2686</a>节），因而是指攻击。“后悔”之所以表示偏离真理，是因为以色列人离开埃及，待在旷野，被引入迦南地表示他们不断被引向良善，从而被引向天堂。因此，“后悔就回埃及去”表示远离良善，从而偏离真理；因为“埃及”或“埃及人”表示那些陷入与仁分离之信，并反对教会真理的人（<a href="6692.htm">6692</a>，<a href="7039.htm">7039</a>，<a href="7097.htm">7097</a>，<a href="7317.htm">7317</a>，<a href="7766.htm">7766</a>，<a href="7926.htm">7926</a>节）。至于来自“非利士人”所表示的那些陷入并非源于良善的信之真理之人的攻击，要知道，在来世，这些人侵扰正直人，不断攻击信之良善，也就是仁。因为他们把在世上所抓住的原则或基本观念带入来世，并保留它们，直到他们经历荒凉，也就是被剥夺关于信之认知的一切记忆知识，并被下入地狱。如今，这类灵人数量庞大，他们就住在右前方，在脚底之下的一个层面。他们所住的地方是一种城市。我经常蒙允许与来自那里的灵人交谈，听见他们支持唯信的尖锐推理，对仁持续顽固的攻击。这些就是不领他们从非利士人之地的路走，恐怕他们遇见打仗就后悔在内义上所表示的事。</p>

Perchance the people will repent when they see war. That this signifies that they will turn aside from truth by reason of assaults, is evident from the signification of "to repent," as being to turn 
aside from truth (of which in what follows); and from the signification of "war," as being spiritual combats (see n. 1664, 1788, 2686), thus assaults. That "to repent" denotes to turn aside from truth, 
is because by the departure of the sons of Israel from Egypt, and by their stay in the wilderness, and by their introduction into the land of Canaan, is signified that they were continually led to good, 
and so to heaven. Hence by "repenting and returning to Egypt" is signified to depart from good, thus to turn aside from truth; for by "Egypt" or "the Egyptians" are signified those who are in faith 
separate from charity, and who are opposed to the truths of the church (n. 6692, 7039, 7097, 7317, 7766, 7926).  [2] As regards assaults by those who are in truth of faith which is not from good, 
who are signified by "the Philistines," be it known that in the other life these infest the well-disposed, and continually assault the good of faith, that is, charity; for the principles which they have 
caught at in the world they carry with them into the other life, and retain them until they have been vastated, that is, are deprived of all the memory-knowledge of the knowledges of faith, and are 
let down into hell. There are at this day great numbers of such spirits, and they dwell to the right in front, in a plane beneath the sole of the foot; their dwelling-place is a kind of city. It has 
often been granted me to speak with them from there, and to hear their reasonings in favor of faith alone, which are acute; and their assaults against charity, which are stubborn. These then are the things 
which in the internal sense are meant by their not being led by the way of the land of the Philistines, and by their perchance repenting when they saw war. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8096</b></p><p><b>8096.</b>
'Perhaps the people will change their minds when they see war' means that they will fall away from the truth as a result of attacks. This is clear from the meaning of 'changing one's mind' as falling 
away from the truth, dealt with below; and from the meaning of 'war' as spiritual conflicts, dealt with in <a href="1664.htm">1664</a>, <a href="1788.htm">1788</a>, <a href="2686.htm">2686</a>, and so as attacks. The reason why 'changing one's mind' means falling away 
from the truth is that the departure of the children of Israel from Egypt, their stay in the wilderness, and their introduction into the land of Canaan mean that they were being led constantly to good, 
and so to heaven. So it is that changing one's mind and returning to Egypt means moving away from good and so falling away from the truth; for 'Egypt' or 'the Egyptians' means those who are governed 
by faith separated from charity and are opposed to the Church's truths, <a href="6692.htm">6692</a>, <a href="7039.htm">7039</a>, <a href="7097.htm">7097</a>, <a href="7317.htm">7317</a>, <a href="7766.htm">7766</a>, <a href="7926.htm">7926</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 With regard to attacks from those governed by the truth of faith which does not spring 
from good, that is, those meant by 'the Philistines', it should be recognized that in the next life they molest the upright and constantly make attacks on the good of faith, which is charity. For 
they take with them into the next life the basic ideas they adopted in the world, and they retain them until they have undergone vastation, that is, been deprived of all their knowledge of the cognitions 
of faith, and have been sent down to hell. At the present day there is a great number of spirits such as these; and they live out in front on the right, on a level below the soles of the feet. The 
place where they live is a sort of city. I have been allowed many times to speak to spirits from there, and to listen to their reasonings in favour of faith alone, which are sharp, and their attacks 
on charity, which are persistent. These then are the things which are meant in the internal sense when it says that the people were not led by the way of the land of the Philistines, and that if they 
were they would perhaps change their minds when they saw war. </p>

</p><b>8096.</b>
`Forte paenitebit populum in videre illos bellum': quod significet quod a vero declinabunt per oppugnationes, constat ex significatione `paenitere' quod sit declinare a vero, de qua sequitur; et ex 
significatione `belli' quod sint pugnae spirituales, de qua n. 1664, 1788, 2686, ita oppugnationes.  Quod paenitere sit declinare a vero, est quia per exitum filiorum Israelis ab Aegypto, perque moram 
illorum in deserto, et per introductionem in terram Canaanem, significatur quod ducerentur jugiter ad bonum, et sic ad caelum; inde per `paenitere et reverti ad Aegyptum' significatur abire a bono, ita 
declinare a vero; nam per `Aegyptum' seu `Aegyptios' significantur qui sunt in fide separata a charitate et qui contra vera Ecclesiae, n. 6692, 7039, 7097, 7317, 7766, 7926. 	2 Quod oppugnationes 
attinet ab illis qui in vero fidei quod non ex bono, qui significantur per `Philistaeos,' sciendum quod illi in altera vita infestent probos, et continuo oppugnent bonum fidei seu charitatem, nam principia 
quae in mundo {1}captarunt in alteram vitam secum ferunt ac retinent, usque dum vastati sunt, hoc est, privati omni scientia cognitionum fidei, ac demissi in infernum; hodie sunt tales magno numero, 
et habitant ad dextrum antrorsum in plano sub planta; habitatio (c)illorum est species urbis; cum illis inde loqui pluries datum est, et audire ratiocinia {2}pro fide sola quae acuta sunt, et oppugnationes 
charitatis quae contumaces.  Haec nunc sunt, quae in sensu interno intelliguntur per quod `non ducerentur via terrae Philistaeorum' et quod tunc `forte paeniteret illos in videre illos bellum.' 	@1
