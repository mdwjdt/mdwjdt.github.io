<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5657节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5657.</strong>“看哪，各人的银子，仍在各人的口袋内”表清楚发现真理可以说是白白赐予的。这从“各人的银子，仍在各人的口袋内”的含义清楚可知，“各人的银子，仍在各人的口袋内”是指白白赐予的真理（参看<a href="5530.htm">5530</a>，<a href="5624.htm">5624</a>节）。“各人的银子在各人的袋口内”意思差不多也一样，不同之处在于：这句话表示已经白白赐予，并被存储在外层属世层的门槛处的真理；因为“袋口”表示外层属世层的门槛处（<a href="5497.htm">5497</a>节）。此处之所以表示可以说白白赐予，是因为他们处于怀疑或不确定的状态，即怀疑或不确定他们愿不愿意与内在联结，因为害怕他们会变得一文不值，或如同无有。当有人处于怀疑或不确定的状态时，他就会对用来证实的真理产生怀疑，或感到不确定。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5657</b></p><p><b>5657.</b>
And behold everyone's silver in the mouth of his bag. That this signifies that it was clearly seen that truths had been given as it were gratuitously, is evident from the signification of "everyone's 
silver in his bag," as being truths given gratuitously (see n. 5530, 5624). It is similar with "everyone's silver in the mouth of his bag," with the difference that by this are signified the truths that 
had been given gratuitously, and that had been stored up in the threshold of the exterior natural; for by the "mouth of the bag" is signified the threshold of the exterior natural (n. 5497). As it 
were given gratuitously is here signified because they are in a state of doubt as to whether they would be willing to be conjoined with the internal and become as nothing; and when anyone is in a state 
of doubt, he feels doubtful also about the truths which confirm. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5657</b></p><p><b>5657.</b>
'That behold, each man's silver was in the mouth of his pouch' means that it was observed that the truths had been so to speak freely given. This is clear from the meaning of 'each man's silver in his 
sack' as truths freely given, dealt with in <a href="5530.htm">5530</a>, <a href="5624.htm">5624</a>, 'each man's silver in the mouth of his pouch' meaning much the same. The difference is that the latter statement means that the truths which were 
freely given were placed in the opening of the exterior natural; for 'the mouth of the pouch' means the opening of the exterior natural, <a href="5497.htm">5497</a>. The reason why so to speak freely is meant at this point 
is that they dwell in a state of uncertainty, unsure whether they want to be joined to the internal, for fear that they will cease to be of any worth. And when anyone dwells in a state of uncertainty 
he feels unsure about the truths that serve to corroborate. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 5657</b>
</p><b>5657.</b>
`Et ecce argentum cujusvis in ore manticae suae': quod significet quod perspectum quod vera quasi gratis donata, constat ex significatione `argenti cujusvis in sacco' quod sint vera donata gratis, de 
qua n. 5530, 5624, similiter `argentum cujusvis in ore manticae', cum differentia quod per hoc significentur vera quae donata gratis, quod in limine naturalis exterioris reposita sint, nam per `os manticae' 
 significatur limen exterioris naturalis, n. 5497.  Quod significetur hic quasi gratis donata, est quia in statu dubitativo sunt num conjungi velint interno, ne nihili fiant; et cum quis in statu 
dubitativo est, etiam de veris quae confirmant, sentit dubitative. </p>
