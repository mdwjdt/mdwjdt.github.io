<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10332节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10332</strong>.“能巧设图案，用金、银、铜去制作”表为了代表良善和真理的内层和外层，它们构成一个受意愿驱动的理解力，因而构成源于爱的信。这从“巧设图案”、“制作”和“金、银、铜”的含义清楚可知：“巧设图案”或发明创造是指从理解力发出之物（参看<a href="9598.htm">9598</a>，<a href="9688.htm">9688</a>节）；“制作”是指从意愿发出之物（<a href="9282.htm">9282</a>节），因为一个人所做的，是从他的意愿发出的，在此是从他的意愿通过他的理解力发出的，因为经上说“巧设图案去制作”；“金”是指良善，“银”是指真理（参看<a href="1551.htm">1551</a>，<a href="1552.htm">1552</a>，<a href="5658.htm">5658</a>，<a href="6914.htm">6914</a>，<a href="6917.htm">6917</a>，<a href="8932.htm">8932</a>，<a href="9490.htm">9490</a>，<a href="9874.htm">9874</a>，<a href="9881.htm">9881</a>节）；“铜”是指属世人或外在人的良善（<a href="425.htm">425</a>，<a href="1551.htm">1551</a>节）。所以“金、银、铜”表示良善和真理的内层和外层；“金”表示内层良善，“银”表示内层和外层真理，“铜”表示外在良善。所表示的之所以是这些良善和真理的一个代表，是因为所论述的主题是一个代表性教会，比撒列要制作的一切事物都是具有代表性。<br />由此明显可知，“能巧设图案，用金、银、铜去制作”表示为了代表良善和真理的内层和外层，它们构成一个受意愿驱动的理解力。它们之所以也是构成源于爱的信的事物，是因为真理属于信，与理解力有关，而良善属于爱，与意愿有关。之所以说“受意愿驱动的理解力”和“源于爱的信”，是因为理解力若不受意愿驱动，根本什么都不是。事实上，一个人理解，却不意愿的东西并不属于他自己的理解力，而是属于在他里面的另一个人的理解力；因此，这种理解力会逐渐消失。但当理解力受意愿驱动时，情况就不同了；这种理解力是属于这个人自己的，因为意愿就是这个人自己。这同样适用于信和爱；因为如前所述，信之真理与理解力有关，爱之良善与意愿有关。</p>

To think thoughts to make in gold, and in silver, and in brass. That this signifies to represent in goods and truths, interior and exterior, which are of the understanding from the will, thus which are 
of faith from love, is evident from the signification of "thinking thoughts," or of inventing inventions, as being that which proceeds from the understanding (see n. 9598, 9688); from the signification 
of "making," as being that which proceeds from the will (n. 9282), for that which a man makes proceeds from his will, here from his will through his understanding, for it is said, "to think thoughts 
to make;" from the signification of "gold," as being good, and of "silver," as being truth (see n. 1551, 1552, 5658, 6914, 6917, 8932, 9490, 9874, 9881); and from the signification of "brass," as 
being the good of the natural or external man (n. 425, 1551). Consequently by "gold, silver, and brass" are signified goods and truths interior and exterior; by "gold," interior good; by "silver," interior 
and exterior truth; and by "brass," external good. That it is a representative of these goods and truths that is signified, is because the subject treated of is a representative church, and all 
the things that Bezalel was to make were representative.  [2] From all this it is evident that by "thinking thoughts to make in gold, and in silver, and in brass" is signified to represent goods and 
truths interior and exterior which are of the understanding from the will. That there are also signified the things which are of faith from love, is because truths are of faith and bear relation to the 
understanding, and goods are of love and bear relation to the will. It is said "the understanding from the will, and faith from love," because the understanding is not anything except from the will, 
for that which a man understands and does not will, is not of the man's understanding, but is of the understanding of another in himself, and therefore this understanding perishes. It is otherwise with 
understanding from the will, for this understanding is of the man himself, because the will is the man himself. The case is similar with faith and love, for as before said, the truths of faith bear 
relation to the understanding, and the goods of love to the will. </p>

'To compose designs, to work in gold, and in silver, and in bronze' means in order to represent the interior and the exterior forms of good and truth that constitute an understanding animated by the 
will, thus that constitute faith springing from love. This is clear from the meaning of 'composing designs', or inventing devices, as that which is a product of the understanding, dealt with in <a href="9598.htm">9598</a>, <a href="9688.htm">9688</a>; from the meaning of 'working' as that which is a product of the will, dealt with in <a href="9282.htm">9282</a>, for what a person does is a product of his will, in this instance of the will operating through the understanding, 
since it says 'to compose designs, to work ...'; from the meaning of 'gold' as good, and of 'silver' as truth, dealt with in <a href="1551.htm">1551</a>, <a href="1552.htm">1552</a>, <a href="5658.htm">5658</a>, <a href="6914.htm">6914</a>, <a href="6917.htm">6917</a>, <a href="8932.htm">8932</a>, <a href="9490.htm">9490</a>, <a href="9881.htm">9881</a>, <a href="9874.htm">9874</a>; and from the 
meaning of 'bronze' as the good of the natural or external man, dealt with in <a href="425.htm">425</a>, <a href="1551.htm">1551</a>. Consequently interior and exterior forms of good and truth are meant by 'gold, silver, and bronze', interior 
good by 'gold', interior and exterior truth by 'silver', and external good by 'bronze'. The reason why that which is representative of these forms of good and truth is what is meant is that the representative 
Church is the subject, and all the things that Bezalel was going to make were representative.  </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 From all this it is evident that 'to compose designs, to work in gold, in silver, and in 
bronze' means in order to represent interior and exterior forms of good and truth that constitute an understanding animated by the will. The reason why they are also those that constitute faith springing 
from love is that truths belong to faith, and truths have connection with the understanding, while forms of good belong to love, and forms of good have connection with the will. The expressions 'an 
understanding animated by the will' and 'faith springing from love' are used because the understanding is nothing at all unless it is animated by the will. For what a person understands but does not 
also will is not an understanding that is his own but that of another within him; and as a consequence that understanding fades away. But it is different when the understanding is animated by the will; 
it is then that of the person himself, because the will is the person himself. The like applies to the faith and love; for as has been stated, the truths of faith have connection with the understanding, 
and forms of the good of love with the will.  </p>

`Ad excogitandum excogitationes, ad faciendum in auro, et in argento, et in aere': quod {1}significet ad repraesentandum bona et vera interiora et exteriora quae intellectus ex voluntate, ita quae fidei 
ex amore, constat ex significatione `excogitare excogitationes' seu invenire inventiones, quod sit quod procedit ex intellectu, de qua n. 9598, 9688; ex significatione `facere' quod sit quod procedit 
ex voluntate, de qua n. 9282, nam quod facit homo, hoc ex {2}velle ejus procedit, hic ex {2}velle per intellectum, nam dicitur ad excogitandum (x)excogitationes ad faciendum; ex significatione `auri' 
quod sit bonum, et `argenti' quod sit verum, de qua n. 1551, 1552, 5658, 6914, 6917, 8932, 9490, 9881, (x)9874; et ex significatione `aeris' quod sit bonum naturalis seu externi hominis, de qua n. 
425, 1551; inde per `aurum, argentum, et aes' significantur bona et vera interiora et exteriora, {3}per `aurum' bonum interius, {4}per `argentum' verum interius et {5} exterius, et {6}per `aes' bonum 
externum; quod sit repraesentativum horum bonorum et verorum quod significatur, est quia agitur de Ecclesia repraesentativa, et omnia quae Bezaleel facturus (d)erat, (t)repraesentativa erant {7}. 	[2] 
Ex his patet quod per `ad excogitandum excogitationes ad faciendum in auro, {8} in argento, et in aere' significetur ad repraesentandum bona et vera interiora et exteriora quae intellectus ex voluntate; 
quod etiam sint quae fidei ex amore, est quia vera sunt fidei, (c)ac vera se referunt ad intellectum, et bona sunt amoris, ac bona se referunt ad voluntatem. Dicitur intellectus ex voluntate, et 
fides ex amore, quia intellectus non est quicquam nisi sit ex voluntate, nam quod (t)intelligit homo et non vult, non est intellectus hominis sed est intellectus {9}alterius in se, quapropter is intellectus 
perit; aliter intellectus {10}ex voluntate, ille est ipsius hominis, quoniam voluntas est ipse homo; similiter se habet cum fide et amore, nam, ut dictum est, vera fidei se referunt ad intellectum, 
et bona amoris ad voluntatem. @1 significent$ @2 voluntate$ @3 aurum enim est$ @4 argentum est$ @5 i quoque$ @6 aes est$ @7 i, quod aurum argentum et aes repraesentaverint bona constare 
potest, de auro videatur n. 9510$ @8 i et$ @9 alius$ @10 qui ex voluntate ejus est$ </p>
