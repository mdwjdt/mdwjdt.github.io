<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1444节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1444.</strong>“那时，迦南人在那地”表祂的外在人中来自母亲的遗传之恶。这从前面关于主的遗传性清楚可知。因为祂象其他人那样出生，并从母亲那里获得祂与之争战并克服的邪恶。众所周知，主经历并承受了极其严厉的试探（关于这些试探，蒙主怜悯，容后再述）。事实上，试探如此之大，以致祂独自凭自己的力量与整个地狱争战。若非邪恶粘附于人，没人会经受试探。人若没有任何邪恶，根本不会经受一丁点试探，因为地狱灵所激发的，正是邪恶。<br />主里面没有任何诸如人里面的实际邪恶或祂自己的邪恶，只有来自母亲的遗传之恶，在此被称为“那时，迦南人在那地”。对此，参看1节的解读（<a href="1414.htm">1414</a>节），即人里面有两种遗传性，一种来自父亲，一种来自母亲；来自父亲的永远保留，而来自母亲的则在人重生期间被主驱散。然而，对主而言，来自其父的遗传是神性，而来自母亲的遗传是此处所提及的邪恶，祂通过这恶经受试探（关于这些试探，可参看马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可1.12.htm">1:12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/可1.13.htm">13</a>；马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太4.1.htm">4:1</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路4.1.htm">4:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路4.2.htm">2</a>）。但如前所述，祂没有任何实际或祂自己的邪恶，祂藉着试探征服地狱后，也没有了来自母亲的任何遗传之恶；鉴于此，此处经上说那时有这种恶，也就是说“那时，迦南人在那地。”<br />迦南人就是住在海边并约旦河旁的人，这清楚可见于摩西书：<br />侦察的人回来说，我们到了你所打发我们去的那地，果然是流奶与蜜之地，这就是那地的果子。然而住那地的民强壮，城邑也坚固宽大，并且我们在那里看见了亚衲族人的后代。亚玛力人住在南地；赫人、耶布斯人、亚摩利人住在山地；迦南人住在海边并约旦河旁。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民13.27.htm">13:27</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民13.29.htm">29</a>）<br />“迦南人住在海边并约旦河旁”表外在人中诸如遗传自母亲的邪恶，因为海边和约旦是边界。<br />“迦南人”表这种恶，这也明显可见于撒迦利亚书：<br />当那日，在万军之耶和华的殿中，必不再有迦南人。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚14.21.htm">14:21</a>）<br />这论及主的王国。意思是，主战胜了“迦南人”所表示的邪恶，并将其逐出自己的王国。各种邪恶由迦南地的各个偶像崇拜的民族来表示，迦南人就住在这迦南地中（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创15.19.htm">15:19</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/创15.21.htm">21</a>；出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出3.8.htm">3:8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出3.17.htm">17</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/出23.23.htm">23:23</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出23.28.htm">28</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/出33.2.htm">33:2</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/出34.11.htm">34:11</a>；申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申7.1.htm">7:1</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/申20.17.htm">20:17</a>；约书亚记<a href="http://39-27.cn/书3.10.htm">3:10</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/书24.11.htm">24:11</a>；士师记<a href="http://39-27.cn/士3.5.htm">3:5</a>）。至于各个民族具体指哪种邪恶，蒙主怜悯，我将在别处予以阐述。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1444.</strong> The symbolism of and the Canaanite was then in the land as the evil in his outer self that he inherited from his mother can be seen from statements already made about the Lord's heredity [搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1444/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1414" target=_top>1414</a>]. He was born like the rest of us and carried with him different kinds of evil that he had received from his mother, which he fought against and completely overcame. As people generally realize, the Lord underwent and endured heavy spiritual trials. (With the Lord's divine mercy, these will be discussed later [搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1444/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1573#subsection-2-4" target=_top>1573:4</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1444/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1659#subsection-2-2" target=_top>1659:2</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1444/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1661" target=_top>1661</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1444/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1663" target=_top>1663</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1444/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1668" target=_top>1668</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1444/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1690" target=_top>1690</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1444/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1692" target=_top>1692</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1444/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1787" target=_top>1787</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1444/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1812" target=_top>1812-1813</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1444/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1820#subsection-2-5" target=_top>1820:5</a>].) In fact he fought alone, with his own might, against all of hell; that is how severe his trials were.<br />No one can undergo spiritual crisis unless something bad clings to the person. No one devoid of evil can suffer the least tribulation. Evil is what hellish spirits stir up.<br />[2] The Lord had no actual evil, no evil of his own, as all the rest of us do. What he had was evil inherited from his mother, which in the present verse is called the Canaanite then in the land. For more on this, see the remarks above at verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1444/bible_king-james-version_genesis_12_1" target=_top>1</a>, 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1444/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1414" target=_top>1414</a>. To review, we are born with two heredities, one from our father and the other from our mother. Our heredity from our father lasts forever; that from our mother is dissolved by the Lord when we are being reborn. The Lord's heredity from his father, though, was divine, while his heredity from his mother was evil. The latter is the subject of the current verse and is what enabled him to be put to the test. (For mention of his trials, see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1444/bible_king-james-version_mark_1_12-13" target=_top>Mark 1:12-13</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1444/bible_king-james-version_matthew_4_1" target=_top>Matthew 4:1</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1444/bible_king-james-version_luke_4_1-2" target=_top>Luke 4:1-2</a>.) But again, he had no actual evil, no evil of his own. Nor did any of his mother's evil heredity remain after he had overthrown hell through his trials, which is why it says here that it was then, that is, that the Canaanite was then in the land.<br />[3] The Canaanites were people who lived along the sea{*1} and the shores of the Jordan, as is evident in Moses:<br />When the scouts returned, they said, "We came into the land to which you sent us, and in fact it was flowing with milk and honey, and this is its fruit. But a strong people is living in the land, and the cities are fortified and very big, and we saw the offspring of Anak there. Amalek lives in the south; and the Hittite and the Jebusite and the Amorite live on the mountain, and the Canaanite lives along the sea and along the shores of the Jordan." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1444/bible_king-james-version_numbers_13_27" target=_top>Numbers 13:27</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1444/bible_king-james-version_numbers_13_28" target=_top>28</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1444/bible_king-james-version_numbers_13_29" target=_top>29</a>)<br />The fact that the Canaanites lived along the sea and the shores of the Jordan consequently symbolized evil in a person's outer self 钬?the kind of evil we inherit from our mother 钬?since the sea and the Jordan were outer borders.<br />[4] Zechariah also yields evidence that a Canaanite symbolizes this kind of evil:<br />No longer will there be a Canaanite in the house of Jehovah Sabaoth on that day.

And the Canaanite was then in the land. That this signifies the evil heredity from the mother, in His external man, is evident from what has been already said concerning that which was inherited by the 
Lord; for He was born as are other men, and inherited evils from the mother, against which He fought, and which He overcame. It is well known that the Lord underwent and endured the most grievous temptations 
(concerning which, of the Lord's Divine mercy hereafter), temptations so great that He fought alone and by His own power against the whole of hell. No one can undergo temptation unless evil 
adheres to him; he who has no evil cannot have the least temptation; evil is what the infernal spirits excite.  [2] In the Lord there was not any evil that was actual, or His own, as there is in all 
men, but there was hereditary evil from the mother, which is here called "the Canaanite then in the land." Concerning this, see what was said above, at verse 1 (n. 1414), namely, that there are two hereditary 
natures connate in man, one from the father, the other from the mother; that which is from the father remains to eternity, but that which is from the mother is dispersed by the Lord while the 
man is being regenerated. The Lord's hereditary nature from His Father, however, was the Divine. His heredity from the mother was evil, and this is treated of here, and is that through which He underwent 
temptations (see Mark 1:12-13; Matt. 4:1; Luke 4:1-2). But, as already said, He had no evil that was actual, or His own, nor had He any hereditary evil from the mother after He had overcome hell 
by means of temptations; on which account it is here said that there was such evil at that time, that is, that the "Canaanite was then in the land."  [3] The Canaanites were those who dwelt by the sea 
and by the coast of Jordan, as is evident in Moses. The spies on their return said: </p>
<p>     We came unto the land whither thou sentest us, and surely it floweth with milk and honey, and this is the fruit 
of it. Howbeit the people that dwelleth in the land is strong, and the cities are fenced, very great; and moreover we saw the children of Anak there; Amalek dwelleth in the south; and the Hittite 
and the Jebusite and the Amorite dwell in the mountains; and the Canaanite dwelleth by the sea, and by the coast of Jordan (Num. 13:27-29). That the Canaanites dwelt by the sea and by the coast of Jordan, 
signified evil thence in the external man, such as is the heredity from the mother; for the sea and the Jordan were boundaries.  [4] That such evil is signified by "the Canaanite," is also evident 
in Zechariah: </p>
<p>     In that day there shall be no more a Canaanite in the house of Jehovah Zebaoth (Zech. 14:21); </p>
<p>where the Lord's kingdom is treated of, and it is signified that the Lord will conquer 
the evil meant by the Canaanite and will expel it from His kingdom. All kinds of evils are signified by the idolatrous nations in the land of Canaan, among which were the Canaanites (see Gen. 15:18-21; 
Exod. 3:8, 17; 23:23, 28; 33:2; 34:11; Deut. 7:1; 20:17; Josh. 3:10; 24:11; Judges 3:5). What evil is signified by each nation specifically, shall of the Lord's Divine mercy be told elsewhere. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1444</b></p><p><b>1444.</b>
'And the Canaanite was at that time in the land' means the hereditary evil from the mother, in His external man. This becomes clear from what has been stated already about the Lord's heredity; for He 
was born as any other is born and from the mother acquired evils which He fought against and overcame. It is well known that the Lord underwent and endured very severe temptations - which will in the 
Lord's Divine mercy be described further on - temptations so great in fact that He fought by Himself and from His own power against the whole of hell. Nobody can undergo temptation unless he has evil 
clinging to him. The person who has no evil cannot experience the smallest temptation, for it is evil that spirits from hell stir up. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 With the Lord no evil of His own doing or that was His own 
was present, as there is with all human beings, only hereditary evil from the mother, which is here called 'the Canaanite at that time in the land'. For this matter see what has been stated above in 
verse 1, in <a href="1414.htm">1414</a>, to the effect that people are born with two heredities in them, the first from the father, the second from the mother. What comes from the father remains for ever, but what comes from 
the mother is dispelled by the Lord when the person is being regenerated. The Lord's heredity from His Father however was Divine, while the heredity from the mother was the hereditary evil referred 
to here, through which He underwent temptations. Regarding His temptations, see <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%201:12,%2013&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 1:12, 13</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%204:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 4:1</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%204:1,%202&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 4:1, 2</a>. But, as has been stated, He had no evil of His own doing or which was His own, nor 
did He have any hereditary evil from the mother after He had overcome hell by means of temptations. It is for this reason that the expression at that time occurs here, that is to say, 'the Canaanite 
was at that time in the land'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The Canaanites were people who dwelt by the sea and by the bank of the Jordan, as is clear in Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
The spies returned and said, We came into the land to which 
you sent us, and it is indeed flowing with milk and honey, and this is its fruit. Nevertheless the people dwelling in the land are powerful and the cities are very strongly fortified, and also we saw 
the descendants of Anak there. The Amalekite dwells in the south, and the Hittite, Jebusite, and Amorite dwell in the mountains, and the Canaanite dwells by the sea and by the bank of the Jordan. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2013:27-29&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 13:27-29</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The Canaanite dwelt by the sea and by the bank of the Jordan' meant evil consequently residing with the external man, such as that acquired by heredity from the mother, for the sea and 
the Jordan were boundaries.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 That this kind of evil is meant by 'the Canaanite' is clear also in Zechariah, </p>
<blockquote>
And there will no longer be a Canaanite in the house of Jehovah Zebaoth on that 
day. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Zech%2014:21&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Zech 14:21</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the Lord's kingdom. It means that the Lord overcame the evil meant by 'the Canaanite' and drove it out of His kingdom. Evils of every kind are meant by the idolatrous 
nations in the land of Canaan, among which were the Canaanites, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2015:19-21&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 15:19-21</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%203:8,%2017;%2023:23,%2028;%2033:2;%2034:11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 3:8, 17; 23:23, 28; 33:2; 34:11</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%207:1;%2020:17&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 7:1; 20:17</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Josh%203:10;%2024:11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Josh 3:10; 24:11</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Judg%203:5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Judg 3:5</a>.

'Et Canaanita tunc in terra':  quod significet hereditarium a matre malum in externo Ipsius homine, constare potest ab illis quae prius dicta de hereditario apud Dominum; natus enim fuit sicut alius 
homo, et Secum a matre traxit mala, contra quae pugnavit et quae evicit; notum est quod Dominus tentationes gravissimas subierit et sustinuerit, de quibus, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, in sequentibus; 
et quidem tantas ut pugnaverit solus et ex propria potentia contra totum infernum; nemo potest tentationem subire nisi illi malum adhaereat; cui nullum malum, ne minimum tentationis habere potest; 
[2] malum est quod infernales spiritus excitant; apud Dominum non malum aliquod actuale aut proprium fuit ut apud omnes homines, sed malum hereditarium a matre, quod hic vocatur 'Canaanita tunc in terra,' 
de quo videantur quae dicta supra ad vers. 1, n. 1414, nempe quod bina hereditaria sint quae connascuntur homini, unum ex patre, alterum ex matre; quod a patre, hoc manet in aeternum, quod a matre, 
hoc dispergitur a Domino cum homo regeneratur; at hereditarium Domini a Patre Ipsius fuit Divinum, hereditarium a matre fuit malum de quo hic, per quod tentationes subiit, de quibus videatur Marc. 
i 12, 13; Matth. iv 1; Luc. iv 1, 2; se,d ut dictum, Ipsi nullum actuale seu proprium malum, nec aliquod hereditarium a matre malum postquam per tentationes evicit infernum, quare hic dicitur quod tunc 
fuerit, nempe, 'Canaanita tunc in terra.' [3] Canaanitae fuerunt qui habitabant juxta mare et juxta litus Jordanis, ut constat apud Mosen, Exploratores reversi dixerunt, Venimus in terram quo misisti 
nos, et etiam fluens lacte et melle illa, et hic fructus ejus; nisi quod fortis populus habitans in terra, et urbes munitae magnae valde, et etiam natos Anaki vidimus ibi; Amalekus habitat in meridie, 
et Hittaeus, et Jebusaeus, et Emoraeus habitat in monte, et Canaanita habitat juxta mare, et juxta litus Jordanis, Num. xiii 27-29; </p>
<p>'quod Canaanitae habitaverint juxta mare et juxta litus Jordanis' 
significabat inde malum apud externum hominem, quale est hereditarium a matre, nam mare et Jordanes erant termini:  [4] quod malum tale per 'Canaanitam' significetur, constat quoque apud Zachariam, Non 
erit Canaanita amplius in domo Jehovae Zebaoth in die illo, xiv 21; </p>
<p>ubi de regno Domini, quo significatur quod Dominus evicerit malum per 'Canaanitam' intellectum et a regno Suo expulerit.  Omnia 
genera malorum significantur per gentes idololatras in terra Canaanaea, inter quas Canaanitae, ut Gen. xv (x)19-21; Exod. iii 8, 17; xxiii 23, 28; xxxiii 2; xxxiv 11; Deut. vii 1; xx 17; Jos. iii 
10; xxiv 11; Jud. iii 5; quodnam malum per unamquamvis gentem in specie significatur, alibi, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, dicendum. </p>
