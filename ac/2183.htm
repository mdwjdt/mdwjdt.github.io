<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2183节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2183.</strong>“亚伯拉罕又取了奶油和奶，并预备好的牛犊来”表所有那些被如此联结起来的事物。这从稍后所解释的“奶油”、“奶”和“牛犊”的含义清楚可知。此前几节论述的主题是预备主的理性，它在“作成饼的细面饭”所表示的属天之物和源于此的属灵之物上接受教导（<a href="2176.htm">2176</a>，<a href="2177.htm">2177</a>节）；它也是“牛犊”所表示的属天-属世之物 （<a href="2180.htm">2180</a>节）。其它词，也就是现在的“奶油”、“奶”和“牛犊”同样表示所有这些事物，这时，它们已经被联结起来。<br />人几乎难以将这些事描述给理解力很普通的人，因为绝大多数人并不知道每个人都拥有一个内在，一个理性和一个属世层，并且这三者彼此截然不同，互相分离。事实上，它们的差异会大到彼此唱反调的地步。也就是说，理性，就是所谓的理性人，会与属世层，就是属世人唱反调；事实上，理性人能看到并发觉属世人里面的邪恶，它若是真正的理性，则能惩戒这邪恶 （参看<a href="1904.htm">1904</a>节）。在这二者联结起来之前，人无法成为一个完整或完全人，也体验不到平安的宁静，因为这二者彼此冲突。与人同在的天使主宰他的理性，而与人同在的恶灵主宰他的属世层，这便造成冲突。<br />这时，若理性得胜，属世层就被征服，这人因此被赋予良知；但若属世层得胜，那他根本无法接受任何良知。若理性得胜，他的属世层就会变得好像它也是理性的；而若属世层得胜，理性就会变得好像它也是属世的。另外，若理性得胜，天使就更接近此人，并在他里面植入仁爱，也就是经由天使从主而来的属天品质；与此同时，恶灵则会远离他。但是，若属世层得胜，天使就会远离，即更加朝向他的内层，而恶灵则更接近理性，并不断攻击它，以仇恨、报复、欺骗等形式充满其心智的低级部分。若理性得胜，此人会进入平安的宁静，在来世则进入天堂的平安中；若属世层得胜，虽然在世时他似乎处于宁静的状态，但一进入来世，他就会陷入地狱的动荡和折磨中。<br />由此可知就人的理性和属世层而言，其状态是何性质。除了他的属世层顺应他的理性，并且这二者联结起来外，没有别的方法能带给他幸福快乐。这一切唯独凭仁爱成就，而仁爱唯独来自主。</p>

He took butter and milk, and the son of an ox that he had made. That this signifies all those things thus conjoined together, is evident from the signification of "butter," of "milk," and of a "son of 
an ox," to be explained presently. In the verses which precede, the subject was the Lord's rational in that it was instructed in the celestial and the derivative spiritual, which are signified by the 
"meal of fine flour made into a cake" (n. 2176, 2177); and it also was the celestial natural, which is signified by the "son of an ox" (n. 2180). The same things are now expressed by other words, namely, 
by "butter," "milk," and also a "son of an ox," by which are signified all those things conjoined together. [2] But these things can with difficulty be described to the ordinary understanding, 
because to most people it is unknown that every man has an internal, a rational, and a natural, and that these are most distinct from each other, nay, so distinct, that one of them may be dissident from 
another; to wit, that the rational, which is called the rational man, may be dissident from the natural, which is the natural man; nay, that the rational man can even see and perceive the evil which 
is in the natural man and, if it is a genuine rational, may chastise it (see n. 1904). Before these two have been conjoined together, the man cannot be an entire (or perfect) man, nor can he be in the 
tranquillity of peace, for the one fights with the other. For the angels who are with the man rule his rational, but the evil spirits who are with him, his natural, and hence comes combat. [3] If 
the rational then conquers, the natural is subjugated, and the man is thus gifted with conscience; but if the natural conquers, he can then receive nothing of conscience. If the rational conquers, his 
natural then becomes as if it also was rational; but if the natural conquers, the rational becomes as if it also was natural. And further, if the rational conquers, the angels then draw nearer into the 
man, and insinuate to him charity (which is the celestial that comes from the Lord through the angels), and the evil spirits remove themselves to a distance; but if the natural conquers, the angels 
then remove themselves further away (that is, more toward the man's interiors), while the evil spirits draw nearer toward the rational, and continually attack it, and fill the lower parts of his mind 
with hatreds, revenges, deceits, and the like. If the rational conquers, the man then comes into the tranquillity of peace, and in the other life into the peace of heaven; but if the natural conquers, 
then, while the man lives he appears as if he were in tranquillity, but in the other life he comes into the unrest and torment of hell. [4] In this way may be known what is the quality of a man's state 
as to his rational, and as to his natural; so that there is nothing else that can make a man blessed and happy but that his natural be conformed to his rational, and both be conjoined together. This 
is effected solely by means of charity, and charity is solely from the Lord. </p>

'He took butter and milk, and the young bull which he had made ready' means all those things so joined together. This becomes clear from the meaning of 'butter', 'milk', and 'the young bull', which are 
dealt with in the next paragraph. The subject in the verses previous to this has been the providing of the Lord's Rational with that which is celestial and that which is spiritual derived from this, 
meant by 'the meal of fine flour made into cakes', <a href="2176.htm">2176</a>, <a href="2177.htm">2177</a>, and also with the celestial-natural, meant by 'the young bull', <a href="2180.htm">2180</a>. The same things are now expressed by other words - by 'butter', 'milk', 
and 'a young bull', which mean all those same things when they have been joined together. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 But one is scarcely able to describe these matters to the ordinary mind because the majority do 
not know that every person possesses an internal, a rational, and a natural, and that these three are quite distinct and separate from one another, so distinct in fact that one can be at variance with 
another. That is to say, the rational, which is called the rational man, can be at variance with the natural, which is the natural man; indeed the rational man is able to see and perceive evil that is 
in the natural, and if it is a genuine rational, is able to correct it, see <a href="1904.htm">1904</a>. Before these two have been joined together man is unable to be whole or to experience the serenity of peace, since the 
one is in conflict with the other. For the angels present with a person govern his rational, while the evil spirits present with him govern his natural - and this gives rise to conflict. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 If 
in this conflict the rational prevails, the natural is placed in subjection, and the man is thus endowed with conscience; but if the natural prevails, he is not able to receive any conscience at all. 
If the rational prevails, his natural becomes as though it too was rational; but if the natural prevails, the rational becomes as though it too was natural. In addition, if the rational prevails, angels 
draw nearer to that person, implanting within him charity, a celestial quality which comes through the angels from the Lord; and at the same time the evil spirits move some distance away from him. 
But if the natural prevails, the angels move further away, that is, more towards his interiors, and the evil spirits draw nearer to the rational, constantly attack it, and fill the lower parts of his 
mind with forms of hatred, revenge, deceit, and the like. If the rational prevails, the man enters into the serenity of peace, and in the next life into the peace of heaven; but if the natural prevails, 
though during his lifetime he seems to experience serenity, he enters in the next life into the unrest and torment of hell. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 From these considerations one may know the nature of a person's state 
so far as his rational and so far as his natural are concerned. There is nothing else that can bring him blessing and happiness except the conformity of his natural to the rational when both are joined 
together. This is achieved solely by means of charity; and charity originates wholly in the Lord. </p>

`Accepit butyrum et lac, et filium bovis, quem fecit': quo' significet omnia illa sic {1} conjuncta, constare potest a significatione `butyri, lactis et filii bovis,' de quibus sequitur: in versibus 
qui praecedunt, actum est de Rationali Domini quod instructum caelesti e inde spirituali, quae significata sunt per `farinam similaginis factam in placentam,' n. 2176, 2177; tum de caelesti naturali 
quod significatur est per `filium bovis,' n. 2180; eadem nunc aliis vocibus exprimuntur, nempe per `butyrum, lac, et filium bovis,' per quae significantur omnia illa conjuncta: [2] sed ad intellectum 
vulgarem haec aegre possunt: describi, ex causa quia ignotum est plerisque quod homini unicuique sit internum, sit rationale, et sit naturale, et quod haec in se distinctissima sint, immo tam distincta 
ut dissidere queat unum a altero, nempe rationale quod rationalis homo vocatur, a naturale quo est homo naturalis, immo ut rationalis homo possit videre et percipere malum quod in naturali, et si genuinum 
rationale est, id castigare, videatur n. 1904 antequam haec bina conjuncta sunt, homo non potest esse integer homo, nec in tranquillitate pacis, nam unum pugnat cum altero; angeli enim qui apud 
hominem sunt, ejus rationale regunt, sed {2} spiritus mali qui apud eundem, ejus naturale; inde est pugna; [3] si rationale tunc vincit, naturale subjugatur, et sic donatur homo conscientia; at si naturale 
vincit, tunc nihil conscientiae recipere potest: si rationale vincit, tunc fit ejus naturale tanquam etiam illud esset rationale; at si vincit naturale, tunc fit rationale tanquam illud {3} esset 
naturale: adhuc, si vincit rationale, tunc angeli propius in hominem accedunt, (c)et insinuant ei charitatem, quae est caeleste, quod per angelos a Domino, ac tunc spiritus mali se ad distantiam removent; 
si vero naturale vincit, tunc angeli longius se removent, hoc est, versus (t)ejus interiora magis, et spiritus mali propius versus rationale accedunt, et illud continue oppugnant, ac inferiora 
ejus opplent odiis, vindictis, dolis, et similibus; nisi rationale vincit, tunc venit homo in tranquillitatem pacis, ac in altera vita in pacem caeli; at si naturale vincit, tunc cum vivit, apparet sicut 
in tranquillitate sit, sed in altera vita in irrequiem et cruciatum inferni venit(n): [4] inde qualis est status hominis quoad ejus rationale, et quoad ejus naturale, sciri potest, quare nihil aliud 
est quod facere possit hominem beatum et felicem quam ut rationali `sit conforme' naturale, et utrumque {4} conjunctum, quod unice fit per charitatem, et charitas unice est a Domino. 	@1 ita, as 
in 2182.$ 	@2 at.$ 	@3 sicut illud etiam.$ 	@4 i sic.$ </p>
