<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第710节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>710.</strong>“你和你的全家都要进入方舟”表示构成意愿之物。这一点从刚才所述清楚可知。在阐述觉知之物的前一章，经上的说法不同：“你同你的妻与儿子、儿媳，都要进入方舟（18节）。”“全家”表示意愿和构成意愿之物，这一点从圣言的各处清楚可知，如耶利米书：<br />他们的房屋、田地和妻子都必转归别人。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶6.12.htm">6:12</a>）<br />“房屋”、“田地”和“妻子”都涉及属意愿之物。<br /><br />你们要盖造房屋，住在其中；栽种田园，吃其中所产的。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶29.5.htm">29:5</a>）<br />“盖造房屋，住在其中”涉及意愿；“栽种田园”涉及觉知。其它经文也一样。频繁提及的“耶和华的殿”表示以爱为主的教会；“犹大家”表示属灵的教会。由于“房屋（或殿，家）”表示教会，故教会（其中有意愿和觉知，或仁和信之物）成员的心智也用“房屋（或殿，家）”来表示。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]710.</strong> The symbolism of enter the ark, you and all your household, as what exists in the will is clear from what I have just said. The previous chapter, where it dealt with affairs of the intellect, used different words: "You will enter the ark: you and your sons and your wife and your sons' wives with you" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_710/bible_king-james-version_genesis_6_18" target=_top>Genesis 6:18</a>). The symbolism of a house or household as the will and what it holds is established by numerous places in the Word, as in Jeremiah:<br />Their houses are transferred to others, their fields and wives together. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_710/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_6_12" target=_top>Jeremiah 6:12</a>)<br />The houses, fields, and wives refer to facets of the will. In the same author:<br />Build houses and live in them; and plant gardens and eat their produce. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_710/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_29_5" target=_top>Jeremiah 29:5</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_710/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_29_28" target=_top>28</a>)<br />The houses to build and inhabit belong to the will, while the gardens to plant belong to the intellect. It is similar in other places. The recurrent phrase the House of Jehovah stands for the church, in which love is first and foremost. The house of Judah stands for the heavenly church, and the house of Israel for the spiritual church, because a house is the church. As a consequence, the mind of someone in the church is also a house, containing as it does both volitional and intellectual content, or qualities of charity and faith. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 710</b></p><p><b>710.</b>
Enter thou end all thy house into the ark. That this signifies the things that are of the will, is therefore evident. In the preceding chapter, where the things of the understanding are meant, it is 
expressed differently, namely: "Thou shalt come into the ark, thou and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee" (verse 18). That a "house" signifies the will and what is of the will, is 
evident in various places in the Word; as in Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Their houses shall be turned over unto others, their fields and their wives together (Jer. 6:12). Here "houses" and also "fields" and "wives" 
relate to things which are of the will. Again: </p>
<p>     Build ye houses and dwell in them; and plant gardens and eat the fruit of them (Jer. 29:5, 28). Here "building houses and dwelling in them" relates 
to the will; "planting gardens" to the understanding: and it is the same in other passages. And the "house of Jehovah" is frequently mentioned as signifying the church wherein love is the principal; 
the "house of Judah" as signifying the celestial church; and the "house of Israel" as signifying the spiritual church. As "house" signifies the church, the mind of the man of the church (wherein 
are the things of the will and of the understanding, or of charity and faith), is also signified by "house." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 710</b></p><p><b>710.</b>
'Enter, you and all your house, into the ark' means things that constitute the will. This is clear from what has just been stated. In the previous chapter, which dealt with things of the understanding, 
verse 18 reads differently, namely 'You shall enter into the ark, you, and your sons, and your wife, and your sons' wives with you'. That 'a house' means the will and what constitutes the will is clear 
from various places in the Word, as in Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Their houses will be turned over to others, their fields and wives together. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%206:11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 6:11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here both 'houses' and 'fields and wives' refers to 
things of the will. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Build houses and dwell in them; and plant gardens and eat their fruit. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2029:5,%2028&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 29:5, 28</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'building and dwelling in houses' has to do with the will, 'planting 
gardens' with the understanding. The same applies in other places. And frequently 'the house of Jehovah' stands for the Church where love is the chief thing. 'The house of Judah' stands for the 
celestial Church, 'the house of Israel' for the spiritual Church, because 'a house' means the Church. Consequently the mind of the member of the Church, which has within it things of the will and those 
of the understanding, that is, of charity and of faith, is meant by 'a house'. </p>

</p><b>710.</b>
'Intra tu et omnis domus in arcam': quod significet illa quae sunt voluntatis, constat inde.  In cap. praec. ubi de intellectualibus, aliter, nempe, 'Intrabis in arcam tu, et filii tui, et uxor tua, 
et uxores filiorum tuorum tecum,' vers. 28. Quod 'domus' significet voluntatem et quae voluntatis, constat passim ex Verbo, ut apud Jeremiam, 	Transferentur domus eorum ad alios, agri et uxores simul: 
vi 12; </p>
<p>ubi tam 'domus' quam 'agri et uxores' se referunt ad illa quae sunt voluntatis: apud eundem, 	Aedificate domos, et inhabitate; et plantate hortos et comedite fructus eorum, xxix 5, 28; </p>
<p>ubi 
'domos aedificare et inhabitare' sunt voluntatis, 'hortos plantare' sunt intellectus: similiter alibi: et multoties 'Domus Jehovae' pro Ecclesia ubi amor est principale: 'Domus Jehudae' pro Ecclesia 
caelesti 'Domus Israelis' pro Ecclesia spirituali, quia 'domus' est Ecclesia; inde mens hominis Ecclesiae, in qua voluntaria et intellectualia sunt, seu quae charitatis et fidei, est 'domus.' </p>
