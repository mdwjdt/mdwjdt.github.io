<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4219节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4219.</strong>为让读者大体了解大人的情况，必须牢记，整个天堂是大人；天堂之所以被称作大人，是因为它对应于主的神性人身。因为唯独主是人，天使和灵人，以及世人仅在他们依赖祂的范围内才是个人。没有人相信人之所以为人，是因为他有一张人脸、一个人体，以及脑袋、器官和肢体。他所拥有的这一切与动物有共同之处，因此这些就是那死去、变成尸体的东西。而人之所以为人，凭的是他能像一个人那样思考和意愿，因而能接受神性之物，也就是主的事物。这些事物将人类与牲畜和野兽区别开来；在来世，他也照着活在肉身期间从主接受并归为己有的那些事物的程度而变成这样的人。</p>

In order that the reader may have a general knowledge of how the case is with the Grand Man, let him bear in mind that the universal heaven is the Grand Man, and that heaven is called the Grand Man because 
it corresponds to the Divine Human of the Lord; for the Lord alone is Man, and an angel and a spirit, and also a man on earth, are men in exact proportion to what they have from Him. Let no one 
believe that man is man from his possession of a natural human face, body, brain, and organs and members; for all these are common to him with brute animals, and therefore these are what die and become 
a carcass. But man is man from being able to think and will as a man, and thus to receive what is Divine, that is, what is of the Lord. By this man distinguishes himself from beasts and wild animals; 
and in the other life also his quality as a man is determined by what he has received from the Lord and made his own in the life of the body. </p>

To have a general knowledge concerning the Grand Man it must be kept in mind that heaven in its entirety is the Grand Man, and that heaven is called the Grand Man because it corresponds to the Lord's 
Divine Human. For the Lord alone is Man, and angels and spirits, as well as people on earth, are likewise men only insofar as they are dependent on Him. Let nobody suppose that anyone is man because 
he has a human face and a human body, and has a brain and also organs and limbs. All of these he has in common with animals, and therefore these are the things which die and become a corpse. But a person 
is man by virtue of his being able to think and will as a human being, and so of his being able to receive things that are Divine, that is which are the Lord's. These things mark the human being off 
from beasts and wild animals; and in the next life too he becomes such a human being in the measure that by accepting those things during his lifetime he has made them his own. </p>

Ut sciatur in genere quomodo se habet cum Maximo Homine tenendum quod universum caelum sit Maximus Homo, et quod caelum Maximus Homo nominatur, quia correspondet Divino Humano Domini solus enim Homo 
est Dominus, et quantum angelus et spiritus, tum quantum homo qui in terris, ab Ipso habet {1}, tantum etiam sunt homines; non credat aliquis quod homo sit homo ex eo quod facies ei humana sit 
et corpus ei humanum, et quod ei cerebrum et quoque viscera et membra; haec sunt communia cum animalibus brutis, quare etiam haec sunt quae moriuntur et fiunt cadaver; sed homo est homo, quod cogitare 
et velle possit sicut homo, ita recipere illa quae sunt Divina, hoc est, quae sunt Domini; per haec homo se distinguit a bestiis et feris; et quoque homo `fit talis' homo in altera vita, qualiter 
illa in vita corporis {2} per receptionem ei appropriata sunt.      @1 before tum$      @2 i sui$      3 ita </p>
