Verses 23-25. And he said, Whose daughter art thou? Tell me I pray is there room in thy father's house for us to pass the night? And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, 
whom she bare unto Nahor. And she said unto him, We have both straw and much provender, also room to pass the night. "He said, Whose daughter art thou?" signifies further exploration concerning innocence; 
"tell me I pray is there room in thy father's house for us to pass the night;" signifies exploration concerning the good of charity; "and she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son 
of Milcah, whom she bare unto Nahor," signifies here as above the whole of its origin; "and she said unto him," signifies perception; "we have both straw," signifies truths in the form of memory-knowledge; 
"and much provender," signifies their goods; "also room to pass the night," signifies the state. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3109</b></p><p><b>3109.</b>
Verses 23-25 And he said, Whose daughter are you? Tell me now, is there at your father's house a place for us to spend the night? And she said to him, I am the daughter of Bethuel, the son of Milkah, 
whom she bore to Nahor. And she said to him, There is both straw and also much fodder with us, and a place to spend the night. </p>
<p>'He said, Whose daughter are you?' means further investigation concerning 
innocence. 'Tell me now, is there at your father's house a place for us to spend the night?' means investigation concerning the good of charity. 'And she said to him, I am the daughter of Bethuel, 
the son of Milkah, whom she bore to Nahor' means here, as previously, the whole origin of it. 'And she said to him' means perception. 'There is both straw' means factual truths. 'And also much fodder 
with us' means the goods that go with these. 'And a place to spend the night' means that state. </p>

Vers. 23-25.  Et dixit, Filia cujus tu? indica quaeso mihi, an est domo patris tui locus nobis ad pernoctandum?  Et dixit ad illum, Filia Bethuelis ego, filii Milkae, quem genuit Nahori.  Et dixit ad 
illum, Etiam stramen, etiam pabulum multum nobiscum, etiam locus ad pernoctandum.  `Dixit, Filia cujus tu?' significat explorationem ulteriorem de innocentia: `indica quaeso mihi, an est domo patris 
tui locus nobis ad pernoctandum?' significat explorationem de bono charitatis: `et dixit ad illum, Filia Bethuelis ego, filii Milkae, quem genuit Nahori' significat, hic ut prius, omnem originem ejus: 
`et dixit ad illum' significat perceptionem: `etiam stramen' significat vera scientifica: `etiam pabulum multum nobiscum' significat bona eorum: `etiam locus ad pernoctandum' significat statum. </p>
