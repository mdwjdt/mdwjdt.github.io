<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8618.</strong>出埃及记17:14-16.耶和华对摩西说，你要将这话写在书上作记念，放在约书亚的耳边，我要将对亚玛力的记忆从天下完全抹掉。摩西筑了一座坛，给它起名叫耶和华尼西。又说，因为亚玛力的手攻击耶的宝座，耶和华必世世代代和亚玛力争战。<br />“耶和华对摩西说”表指示。“你要将这话写在书上作记念”表作为永恒的纪念。“放在约书亚的耳边”表为了与这虚假争战的真理那一方的顺服。“我要将对亚玛力的记忆从天下完全抹掉”表这虚假必须被完全移开，以便它可能不再进行争战。“摩西筑了一座坛”表为了敬拜和纪念的神圣之物。“给它起名叫耶和华尼西”表持续的战争，以及主的保护，以免受那些沉浸于内层邪恶所生虚假之人的伤害。“又说，因为亚玛力的手攻击耶的宝座”表因为他们想对主的属灵国度施暴。“耶和华必世世代代和亚玛力争战”表他们被主的神性能力征服，并被投入地狱，永远不可能从这地狱中上来。</p>

Verses 14-16. And Jehovah said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in the book, and put it in the ears of Joshua, that blotting I will blot out the memory of Amalek from under the heavens. And Moses 
built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovah-nissi; and he said, Because there is a hand against the throne of Jah, Jehovah shall have war against Amalek from generation to generation. "And Jehovah 
said unto Moses," signifies instruction; "Write this for a memorial in the book," signifies for perpetual remembrance; "and put it in the ears of Joshua," signifies to be obeyed in behalf of truth 
fighting against this falsity; "that blotting I will blot out the memory of Amalek from under the heavens," signifies that this falsity must be completely removed so that it may fight no longer; "and 
Moses built an altar," signifies in what is holy of worship and of memory; "and called the name of it Jehovah-nissi," signifies continual warfare and the Lord's protection against those who are in the 
falsity of interior evil; "and he said, Because there is a hand against the throne of Jah," signifies because they wish to do violence to the Lord's spiritual kingdom; "Jehovah shall have war against 
Amalek from generation to generation," signifies that they were brought under the yoke, and were cast into hell, from which by reason of the Lord's Divine power they can never rise up. </p>

Verses 14-16 And Jehovah said to Moses, Write this [for] a memorial in the book, and put it in the ears of Joshua, that I will utterly blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven. And Moses built 
an altar, and called the name of it Jehovah Nissi. And he said, Because [Amalek's] hand is against the throne of Jah, the war of Jehovah will be against Amalek from generation to generation. </p>
<p>'And 
Jehovah said to Moses' means instruction. 'Write this [for] a memorial in the book' means for everlasting remembrance. 'And put it in the ears of Joshua' means with a view to obedience on the part of 
truth engaged in conflict with that falsity. 'That I will utterly blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven' means that that falsity is to be completely removed, so that it may no longer engage 
in conflict. 'And Moses built an altar' means for the holiness of worship and of remembrance. 'And called the name of it Jehovah Nissi' means constant warfare and the Lord's protection against those steeped 
in falsity arising from interior evil. 'And he said, Because [Amalek's] hand is against the throne of Jah' means because they wish to do violence to the Lord's spiritual kingdom. 'The war of Jehovah 
will be against Amalek from generation to generation' means that by the Lord's Divine power they have been subjugated and cast into hell, out of which they can never rise up. </p>

Vers. 14-16.  Et dixit Jehovah ad Moschen, Scribe hoc memoriale in libro, et pone in auribus Joschuae, quod delendo delebo memoriam Amaleki de sub caelis.  Et aedificavit Moscheh altare, et vocavit 
nomen ejus Jehovah Nissi.  Et dixit, Quia manus contra thronum Jah, bellum Jehovae in Amalekum a generatione generationem.  `Et dixit Jehovah ad Moschen' significat instructionem: `Scribe hoc memoriale 
in libro' significat in perpetuam memoriam: `et pone in auribus Joschuae' significat ad oboediendum pro vero pugnante contra id falsum: `quod delendo delebo memoriam Amaleki de sub caelis' significat 
quod falsum illud prorsus removendum sit ut non pugnet amplius {1}: `et aedificavit Moscheh altare' significat in sanctum cultus et memoriae: `et vocavit nomen ejus Jehovah Nissi' significat bellum 
continuum et tutelam Domini contra illos qui in falso mali interioris: et dixit, Quia manus contra thronum Jah' significat quia violentiam inferre volunt regno spirituali Domini: `bellum Jehovae in Amalekum 
a generatione generationem' significat quod sub jugum redacti et {2}in infernum conjecti, unde exsurgere nusquam possunt, ex Divina Domini potentia. 	@1 i (est contra voluntarium hominis, quod 
apud illos qui ab Ecclesia spirituali prorsus removetur) cp n. 8622$ 	@2 ad IT$ </p>
