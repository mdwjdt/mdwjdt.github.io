<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2970节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2970.</strong>“在幔利前面麦比拉”表重生的质与量。这从“麦比拉”和“幔利”的含义清楚可知：“麦比拉”是指藉着信之真理的重生；“幔利”是指重生的质与量。当“麦比拉”与“洞”这个词联起来，或采用“麦比拉洞”这样的表述时，它表示处于模糊状态下的信仰（<a href="2935.htm">2935</a>节）。但当只提“麦比拉”，而没有“洞”这个词，并且后面经上说“田和洞”时，它表示重生，因为“田和洞”表示借以实现重生的信之良善与真理。此外，麦比拉是一块地，里面还有坟墓，而坟墓表示重生（<a href="2916.htm">2916</a>节）。但“幔利”因就是希伯仑（如下面19节所说的），并且就在希伯仑（如创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创13.18.htm">13:18</a>所说的），故无非表示质与量，在此则表示重生的质与量，因为它与“麦比拉”联在一起。它若与“希伯仑”联在一起，就表示教会的质与量；若与“橡树”（如在<a href="1616.htm">1616</a>节）联在一起，则表示直觉的质与量。因此，“幔利”只是对事物状态的界定，因为它是亚伯拉罕所居之地（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创13.18.htm">13:18</a>），也是以撒所居之地，还是雅各所到的地方（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创35.27.htm">35:27</a>）。</p>

Which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre. That this signifies the quality and amount of regeneration, is evident from the signification of "Machpelah" as being regeneration by means of the truth 
which is of faith; and from the signification of "Mamre," as being its quality and amount. By "Machpelah" when the word "cave" is joined to it, or when it is said the "cave of Machpelah," is signified 
faith which is in obscurity (n. 2935); but by "Machpelah" when named without the word "cave," and it is stated afterwards that there is a "field with a cave" there, is meant regeneration; for by the 
"field" and "cave" are signified the good and truth of faith by which the regeneration is effected; and besides, Machpelah was a tract of land in which there was a sepulcher, by which last is signified 
regeneration (n. 2916). But "Mamre," because it was Hebron (as is said in the 19th verse that follows presently), and was in Hebron (as is said in Genesis 13, verse 18), signifies nothing else than 
the quality and amount, here, of regeneration, when joined with "Machpelah;" but of the church when joined with "Hebron;" and likewise of perception when joined with "oak-groves" (as in n. 1616). Thus 
"Mamre" is simply the determination of the state of the thing; for it was a place where Abraham dwelt (Gen. 13:18); and where Isaac dwelt, and to which Jacob came (Gen. 35:27). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2970</b></p><p><b>2970.</b>
'Which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre' means the nature and extent of regeneration. This is clear from the meaning of 'Machpelah' as regeneration by means of the truth of faith, and from the 
meaning of 'Mamre' as the nature and extent of it. When the word 'cave' is combined with the name Machpelah - that is, when the expression 'the cave of Machpelah' is used - faith enveloped in obscurity 
is meant by it, <a href="2935.htm">2935</a>. But when Machpelah is mentioned by itself, and then followed by the phrase 'the field and the cave', regeneration is meant, for 'the field and the cave' means the good and truth 
of faith by means of which regeneration is accomplished. Furthermore Machpelah was a plot of land in which also there was a grave, which means regeneration, <a href="2916.htm">2916</a>. But 'Mamre', being Hebron, as stated 
below in verse 19, or 'in Hebron', as stated in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2013:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 13:18</a>, here means nothing else than the particular kind of a thing and the measure in which this exists. In this case the kind of regeneration 
and the measure of it is meant when 'Mamre' is linked with 'Machpelah'; the kind of Church and the degree to which it exists when 'Mamre' is linked with 'Hebron'; and the kind of perception and the measure 
of the same when 'Mamre' is linked with 'the oak-groves', as in <a href="1616.htm">1616</a>. Thus Mamre merely defines the state of the thing, for it was a place where Abraham dwelt, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2013:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 13:18</a>, and where Isaac dwelt 
and to which Jacob came, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2035:27&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 35:27</a>. </p>

`Qui in Machpelah, quae coram Mamre': quod significet regenerationis quale et quantum, constat a significatione `Machpelae' quod sit regeneratio per verum quod fidei; et a significatione `Mamre' quod 
sit quale et quantum ejus: per `Machpelam' cum ei adjungitur `spelunca,' seu dicitur `spelunca Machpelae,' significatur fides quae in obscuro, n. 2935; at per `Machpelam' cum absque spelunca nominatur, 
et sequitur quod ibi ager et spelunca, {1}intelligitur regeneratio, nam per `agrum et speluncam' significatur bonum et verum fidei, per quae fit regeneratio: et praeterea Machpelah erat tractus in 
quo etiam sepulcrum, per quod regeneratio significatur, n. 2916. `Mamre' autem, quia Hebron, ut {2}dicitur vers, seq. 19, et in Hebron, ut Gen. xiii 18, non aliud significat quam quale et quantum, hic 
regenerationis cum adjungitur `Machpelae,' et Ecclesiae cum adjungitur `Hebroni', et quoque perceptionis cum adjungitur `quercetis,' ut n. 1616, ita `Mamre' est modo determinatio status rei, erat enim 
locus ubi habitavit Abraham, Gen. xiii 18, et ubi Isacus, et quo venit Jacobus, Gen. xxxv 27. @1 significatur$  @2 sequitur$  </p>
