<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8728节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8728.</strong>“他们随时审判百姓”表不断依赖于上面的层级。这从“审判”的含义清楚可知，“审判”是指对真理的排列（参看<a href="8685.htm">8685</a>节），在此是指将它们排列成下降的层级，每一层都依赖于上面的层级；因为要审判百姓的夫长或首领在小事上取代了摩西。内义上的意思是，从内层到外层依次接踵而来的真理从属于直接来自神的真理；因此，它们是一个渠道，主通过这个渠道间接行动。但在专注于人的意义上，它表示处在这种从属关系和依赖中的天使和天使社群；因为它们也是渠道，主通过这渠道间接行动并掌管世人。然而，并不是天使在掌管，而是主通过他们在掌管（<a href="8718.htm">8718</a>，<a href="8719.htm">8719</a>节）。为进一步说明这个问题，要知道，有些事物也来自与一个人同在的天使本身；但成为此人的信和仁，就是其新生命的组成部分的一切良善和真理唯独来自主，也通过天使来自祂。真理为了这个目的或功用而以不断下降的层级被排列所在的整个秩序同样源于祂。来自天使本身的事物就是与此人的情感相一致的那类事物，它们本身并不是良善，但仍为引入来自主的良善和真理而服务。“随时”表示不断，这是显而易见的，无需解释。</p>

And they shall judge the people in every time. That this signifies their consequent perpetual dependence, is evident from the signification of "judging," as being the disposing of truths (see n. 8685), 
here the subordinate disposing, which is dependence; for the princes who were to judge the people were in the place of Moses in small matters; in the internal sense that truths in successive order 
from interior to exterior are subordinate to the truth immediately from the Divine, through which truths the Lord thus acts mediately; but in the sense determined to persons it means the angels and angelic 
societies in such subordination and dependence, for through them the Lord acts mediately and directs men; nevertheless, it is not the angels who direct, but the Lord through them (n. 8718, 8719). 
As further concerning this subject, be it known that some things also come from the angels themselves who are with man; but all the good and truth which become of faith and charity, that is, of the 
new life with man, come from the Lord alone, and also through the angels from Him; in like manner all disposing, which is continual, is for this use. The things which come from the angels themselves are 
such as accommodate themselves to the affection of the man, and in themselves are not goods, but still serve for introducing the goods and truths which are from the Lord. That "in every time" denotes 
perpetually, is evident without explication. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8728</b></p><p><b>8728.</b>
'And they will judge the people at all times' means unceasing dependence on the level above. This is clear from the meaning of 'judging' as the arrangement of truths, dealt with above in <a href="8685.htm">8685</a>, at this 
point the arrangement of them into descending levels, each dependent on the level above; for the rulers who were to judge the people were to be the arbiters in place of Moses in small matters. The meaning 
in the internal sense is that truths following one another in order from more internal to more external levels are subordinated to the truth coming directly from God; and they are accordingly a 
channel through which the Lord acts indirectly. But in the sense focusing specifically on persons, the subordination of angels and angelic communities one below another is meant, and their dependence 
on those immediately above; for they are the channel through which the Lord acts indirectly and governs people on earth. It is not however the angels who govern but the Lord through them, see <a href="8718.htm">8718</a>, <a href="8719.htm">8719</a>. 
To take this matter further, it should be recognized that some things also come from the angels themselves who are present with a person. But all the goodness and the truth that become the components 
of the person's faith and charity, that is, of his new life, come from the Lord alone, even that which comes from Him through the angels. Likewise from Him springs the whole order in which truths 
are arranged in constantly descending levels for that purpose. The things which come from the angels themselves are the kinds of things that accord with the person's affection. They are not in themselves 
forms of good; nevertheless they serve to introduce the forms of good and the truths coming from the Lord. As regards the meaning of 'at all times' as unceasing, this is clear without explanation. </p>

`Et judicabunt populum in omni tempore': quod significet dependentiam inde perpetuam, constat ex significatione `judicare' quod sit dispositio verorum, de qua supra n. 8685, hic dispositio subordinata 
quae est dependentia, nam principes qui judicaturi populum erant loco Moschis in rebus parvis; in sensu interno quod vera in successivo ordine ab interioribus ad exteriora sint subordinata vero immediate 
a Divino, per quae sic Dominus mediate agit, at in sensu ad personas determinato sunt angeli et angelicae societates in tali subordinatione et dependentia, per illos enim Dominus mediate (x)agit 
et regit homines; {1}verum usque non sunt angeli qui regunt, {2} sed est Dominus per illos, videatur n. 8718, 8719.  Quod hanc rem ulterius attinet, sciendum quod etiam quaedam ab ipsis angelis qui 
apud hominem sunt veniant; {3}sed omne bonum et verum quae fiunt fidei et charitatis, hoc est, novae vitae apud hominem, veniunt a Domino solo, etiam per angelos ab Ipso; pariter omnis dispositio, quae 
continua est, ad eum usum; quae ab ipsis angelis veniunt sunt talia quae se affectioni hominis accommodant, ac in se non (t)sunt bona, sed usque inserviunt pro introducendis bonis et veris quae a Domino 
{4}; quod `in omni tempore' sit in perpetuum, constat absque explicatione. 	@1 d sed i at verum d verum$ 	@2 i tametsi ita apparet,$ 	@3 sed omne bonum, quod fit fidei et charitatis, hoc est, 
novae vitae apud hominem venit a Domino solo, a Se et etiam per angelos et quoque$ 	@4 i, concordant enim cum proprio hominis$ </p>
