<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2310节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">第19章</h4><br />2310.前面多次论述了圣言的内义，但我知道，很少有人相信圣言的每个细节里面竟存在这样的意义，预言部分是这样，历史部分也是这样。让人相信预言部分具有这样的含义不难，因为它们里面没有一系列关联事件，同时还有奇怪的表述方式。这不由得让人猜想它们里面含有某种隐秘的含义。历史部分同样具有内义的事实则不那么明显，既因为迄今为止，这种观念从未进入任何人的脑海，还因为历史部分具有这样的特点，即它们吸引人的注意力，使心思不再思考它们里面所隐藏的更深层次的东西。另一个原因是，这些历史事件如所记载的那样，都是真实的。 然而，从以下两点不难推断出这一结论：历史部分也含有天堂与神性之物，但它们并未显露出来：首先，圣言从主经由天堂降到人那里，因此就其来源而言，是与众不同的（下文将通过大量经验说明其来源的性质，以及世俗之人看不到，因而不承认它迥异于字义的事实）；其次，圣言因是神性，故不仅是写给人的，还是写给与人同在的天使的，以便它不但服务于人类，还服务于天堂；圣言以这种方式成为联结天与地的一个媒介。这种联结通过教会、事实上通过教会中的圣言实现。正是由于这个原因，它具有这种性质，并有别于其它一切着作。<br />具体到历史部分来说，除非它们同样包含从文字抽象出来的神性和属天之物，否则，凡思想深邃之人绝不承认它们是受启示的圣言，甚至一点一划也是。有谁会说，本章末尾所讲罗得的女儿所行可憎之事会记录在神的圣言中？或雅各将皮剥成白纹，使枝子露出白的来，将它们插在水槽里，于是羊群就着上了色，有点有斑？还有很多其它事件记录在摩西书、约书亚记、士师记、撒母耳记和列王记中。若它们里面没有深藏某种神性含义，这些事件知道与否无关紧要，因而根本不重要。若不是这个原因，它们与其它有时以这种风格写就，以便具有吸引力的历史作品没什么两样。<br />学术界不知道圣言的历史竟也隐藏神性和天堂之物。要不是对圣言书籍的神圣崇敬从小给他们留下深刻印象，他们很容易发自内心说，若非由于这个原因，圣言并不神圣。然而，圣言神圣并非由于这个原因，而是由于它里面具有内义，也就是天堂与神性之物，并且这内义使得圣言将天与地联结起来，也就是说，将天使的心智与人类的心智联结起来，而人类的心智则由此与主联结起来。</p>

CHAPTER 19            The Internal Sense of the Word has already been many times treated of; but I am aware that few can believe that there is such a sense in everything of the Word, not only in the 
prophetical, but also in the historical parts. That there is such a sense in the prophetical parts can more easily be believed, because in them there is not so connected a series of things, and there 
are also strange expressions in them, from which everyone may conjecture that they contain within them some secret meaning. But that there is also such a sense in the historical parts, does not so easily 
appear, both because this has hitherto come into no one's mind, and because the historical parts are such as to keep the attention fixed on themselves, and thereby to draw away the mind from thinking 
that anything of a deeper nature is there stored up; and also because the historicals are truly such as related. [2] Nevertheless no one can fail to infer that within these parts of the Word also 
there is what is heavenly and Divine, and which does not shine forth; first, from the fact that the Word was sent down by the Lord through heaven to man, and therefore differs in its origin (and what 
the nature of this origin is, and that it is so different and distant from the literal sense as not even to be seen, and consequently not acknowledged, by those who are merely worldly, will be shown 
by many things in what follows); secondly, from the fact that the Word, being Divine, has not been written for man only, but also for the angels with man, in order that it might serve not only for use 
to the human race, but also for use to heaven; and that in this way the Word is a medium uniting heaven and earth. This union takes place by means of the church, and in fact by means of the Word in 
the church, which is for this reason such as it is, and is distinguished from all other writing. [3] As regards the historical parts specifically, unless they in like manner contained Divine and heavenly 
things in a sense abstracted from the letter, they could never be acknowledged by anyone who thinks more deeply to be the inspired Word, even as to every jot. Would anyone say that the abominable 
affair of Lot's daughters, treated of at the end of this chapter, would be related in a Divine Word? or Jacob's peeling rods and making the white appear, and placing them in the watering-troughs, that 
the flock might bear partly-colored, speckled, and spotted young? Besides many other things in the rest of the books of Moses, of Joshua, the Judges, Samuel, and the Kings, which would be of no importance, 
and in regard to which it would be a matter of indifference whether they were known or not known, unless they enfolded deeply within them a secret Divine meaning. If it were not for this, they 
would differ in no respect from other historical narratives, which have sometimes been so written that they seem more effective. [4] As the learned world is unacquainted with the fact that Divine and 
heavenly things lie hidden even within the historical parts of the Word, were it not for the holy veneration for the books of the Word which has been impressed upon them from childhood, they would 
be quite ready to say in their hearts that the Word is not holy except solely from that fact; when yet it is not from that, but because there is within it an internal sense which is heavenly and Divine, 
and which causes it to unite heaven with earth, that is, angelic minds with human minds, and thereby these latter with the Lord. </p>

Reference has been made many times to THE INTERNAL SENSE of the Word; but I am aware that few are able to believe that such a sense exists within every detail of the Word, not only in its prophetical 
sections but also in its historical parts. They have little difficulty in believing that such a sense lies within prophetical sections as these do not possess the same continuity of ideas, and at the 
same time they contain strange modes of expression - which leads everyone to think that these sections must have some hidden content. But the fact that the historical parts in a similar way contain the 
internal sense is not so readily apparent both because the idea has not up to now entered anyone's head and because historical descriptions are such that they engross one's attention and thus draw 
the mind away from thinking that anything deeper lies concealed within them. And a further reason why they are not seen to contain any internal meaning is that the historical events described are true, 
as they have been recorded. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Nevertheless no one can fail from the two following considerations to conclude that the historical parts as well have that which is heavenly and Divine within them 
but which does not show itself plainly: </p>
<p> <a href="1.htm">1</a> The Word has been sent down to man from the Lord by way of heaven and so has a different origin from anything else. The nature of its origin, and the fact 
that this is so different from the literal sense and so far removed from it as not even to be seen, nor consequently acknowledged, by people who are purely worldly, will be shown from much evidence presented 
further on. </p>
<p><a href="2.htm">2</a> Being Divine the Word has been written not only for man's benefit but also for that of the angels present with man. It has been written to be of service not merely to the human 
race but also to heaven. This being so the Word is the medium which unites heaven and earth. Union is effected through the Church, and in fact through the Word within the Church. This is what makes 
it what it is and marks it off from any other literature. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 As regards the historical parts specifically, unless these in a similar way contained Divine and celestial things aside from the letter, 
no one whose thoughts extend beyond this could ever acknowledge them to be the inspired Word, down to every jot. Would anyone say that the abominable matter involving Lot's daughters, described at 
the end of this chapter, would be recorded in the Divine Word? Or that Jacob's peeling the rods until they were white, and placing them in the watering troughs so that the flock reproduced striped, spotted, 
and speckled would be recorded? Would many other events besides these have been recorded in the remaining books of Moses, and in the Books of Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kings - events which would 
be of no importance and therefore of no consequence, whether known about or not, if more deeply within they did not embody some hidden Divine meaning? If they did not do so they would be no different 
from any other historical compositions which have sometimes been written in this fashion to give them a more appealing presentation. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 The learned world does not know that even the historical 
sections of the Word conceal Divine and heavenly things. Consequently but for the sacred respect for the books of the Word which has been instilled into them since early childhood, they might be thoroughly 
disposed to say that the Word is not holy except solely on these grounds. But the Word is holy not because of such respect for it but because of the internal sense within it, which is heavenly 
and Divine, and which causes heaven to be united to earth, that is, angels' minds to men's, and men's thereby to the Lord. </p>

GENESEOS                      CAPUT DECIMUM NONUM </p>
<p>DE SENSU INTERNO Verbi pluries prius actum est; sed scio quod pauci possint credere quod talis sensus sit in singulis Verbi, 
non solum in Propheticis, sed etiam in Historicis: quod talis sensus sit in Propheticis, facilius credi potest quia in illis non talis series est, et simul in illis sunt locutiones peregrinae; inde quod 
aliquod arcanum involvant, quisque autumare potest: sed quod similiter in Historicis, non ita facile apparet, tam quia hactenus nemini in mentem venit, quam quia Historica talia sunt ut animum detineant 
in se, et sic abstrahant mentem ad cogitandum quod altius quoddam ibi reconditum sit; tum quoque quia Historica vere talia sunt, qualiter relata: [2] at usque nullus non concludere potest quod interius 
etiam in illis caeleste et Divinum sit quod non elucet, ex eo: Primo, quod Verbum sit a Domino per caelum ad hominem demissum, et sic quod aliud sit in sua origine; qualis origo sit, et quod haec 
differat et distet a litterali sensu ita ut ne quidem videatur, proinde ab illis qui mere mundani sunt, non agnoscatur, multis in sequentibus ostendetur: Secundo quod Verbum quia Divinum, non solum 
scriptum sit pro homine sed etiam pro angelis apud hominem, ut inserviat non modo usui generi humano sed etiam usui caelo; et quod sic Verbum sit medium uniens caeli et terrae; unio est per Ecclesiam, 
et quidem per Verbum in Ecclesia, quod ideo tale est, et {1} ab omni alio scripto distinguitur.  [3] Quod in specie Historica attinet, nisi ea similiter Divina et caelestia abstracte a littera continerent, 
nusquam agnosci potuissent ab aliquo qui ultra cogitat, pro Verbo inspirato, et hoc quoad unamquamvis iotam; an quisquam diceret quod memoraretur in Divino Verbo de re abominabili filiarum Loti, 
de quibus ad finem hujus capitis? de Jacobo quod baculos decorticaverit et denudaverit ad album, et posuerit in aqualiculis ut pareret grex diversicolores, punctatos et maculosos? praeter plura alia 
in Libris ceteris Mosis, in Joshuae, Judicum, Samuelis, et Regum, quae nullius rei forent, et perinde si scirentur vel non scirentur, nisi Divinum arcanum altius involverent; nisi hoc, nihil differrent 
ab historicis aliis, quae quandoque ita scripta sunt ut plus videantur posse afficere.  [4] Quia orbis eruditus ignorat quod Divina et caelestia intus etiam in historicis Verbi lateant, nisi foret 
ex sancta veneratione quae ab infantia illis pro Libris Verbi impressa est, etiam facile animo dicerent quod Verbum non sit sanctum, nisi solum inde, cum tamen non inde est, sed quia sensus internus, 
et is caelestis et Divinus, inest, qui facit ut uniat caelum cum terra, hoc est, mentes angelicas cum humanis, et sic has cum Domino. 	@1 ut.$ </p>
