<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">创世记十五章经文</h4><br />1. 这些事以后，耶和华的话在异象中临到亚伯兰，说，亚伯兰，你不要惧怕！我是你的盾牌，必大大地赏赐你。<br />2. 亚伯兰说，主耶和华啊，我既无行走的孩子，你还赐我什么呢？并且要承受我家业的是大马色人以利以谢。<br />3. 亚伯兰又说，你看，你没有给我种。看哪，那生在我家中的人就是我的后嗣。<br />4. 看哪，耶和华的话又临到他，说，这人必不成为你的后嗣，你两腰所出的才成为你的后嗣。<br />5. 于是带他到外面，说，你向天观看，数算众星，能数得过来吗？又对他说，你的种将要如此。<br />6. 亚伯兰信耶和华，耶和华就以此算他为义。<br />7. 耶和华又对他说，我是耶和华，曾领你出了迦勒底的吾珥，为要将这地赐你为业。<br />8. 亚伯兰说，主耶和华啊，我怎能知道必得这地为业呢？<br />9. 耶和华对他说，你为我取一头三岁的母牛犊，一只三岁的母山羊，一只三岁的公绵羊，一只斑鸠和一只雏鸽。<br />10. 亚伯兰就把这些都取来，每样从中间劈成两半，一半对着另一半摆列，只有鸟没有劈开。<br />11. 当鸷鸟下来，落在这些尸体上时，亚伯兰就把它们赶走了。<br />12. 日落的时候，亚伯兰沉睡了。看哪，有可怕的大黑暗落在他身上。<br />13. 耶和华对亚伯兰说，你要确实知道，你的种必寄居在别人的地，服事他们；这些人要苦待他们四百年。<br />14. 并且他们所服事的民族，我要惩罚，以后他们必带着许多财物出来。<br />15. 但你要平平安安归到你列祖那里，必享长寿，被人埋葬。<br />16. 到了第四代，他们必回到这里，因为亚摩利人的罪恶到现在还没有满盈。<br />17. 日落时，天幽暗，看哪，有冒烟的炉和烧着的火把从那些肉块中经过。<br />18. 在那日，耶和华与亚伯兰立约，说，我已将这片地赐给你的种，从埃及河直到大河，幼发拉底河，<br />19. 就是基尼人、基尼洗人、甲摩尼人、<br />20. 赫人、比利洗人、利乏音人、<br />21. 亚摩利人、迦南人、革迦撒人、耶布斯人之地。<br /><h4 align="center">概览</h4><br />1778.此处继续论述关于主的事，这时，祂已经历了童年时最为严厉的试探争战，这争战针对的是祂对整个人类，尤其教会所怀的爱。因此，出于对它们未来的担忧，祂得到应许。但也同时说明，当教会开始断气时，它的状态在最后的时日是什么样子。然而，一个新教会将积蓄力量以取而代之，天国也会大幅增加。</p>

After these words,{*1} the word of Jehovah came to Abram in a vision, saying, "Do not be afraid, Abram; I am a shield to you, your very ample reward."<br />2. And Abram said, "Lord Jehovih, what will you give me? For I am walking childless, and my ‘child,' the steward of my household, is the Damascene Eliezer."<br />3. And Abram said, "Here, you have not given me seed, and indeed the ‘child' of my household is my heir."<br />4. And see, now: the word of Jehovah to him, saying, "This one will not be your heir; but one who will issue from your belly will be your heir."<br />5. And leading him outside he said, "Look, please, toward the sky and count the stars, if you can count them." And he said to him, "This is how your seed will be."<br />6. And he believed in Jehovah, and [Jehovah] credited it to him as uprightness.<br />7. And [Jehovah] said to him, "I am Jehovah, who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans, to give you this land to inherit."<br />8. And [Abram] said, "Lord Jehovih, how will I know that I will inherit it?"<br />9. And [Jehovah] said to him, "Take yourself a three-year-old heifer, and a three-year-old she-goat, and a three-year-old ram, and a turtledove, and a chick."<br />10. And he took himself all these things and split them in half and set each of the parts across from its other [half]; but the fowl he did not split.<br />11. And winged creatures swooped down onto the bodies, and Abram drove them away.<br />12. And the sun was about to set, and slumber fell on Abram, and look — terror of immense shadows was falling on him!<br />13. And [Jehovah] said to Abram, "You must know beyond doubt that your seed will be immigrants in a land not theirs; and they will serve [the people of that land], and these will afflict them four hundred years.<br />14. And also the nation they serve I will judge. And after this happens, they will depart with a great deal of property.<br />15. And you will come to your ancestors in peace; you will be buried at a good old age.<br />16. And in the fourth generation they will come back here, because the wickedness of the Amorites will not be complete until that time."<br />17. And it happened that the sun set, and darkness occurred, and see? A furnace of smoke and a torch of fire that passed between those pieces!<br />18. On that day Jehovah struck a pact with Abram, saying, "To your seed will I give this land, from the river of Egypt all the way to the great river, the river Phrath:{*2} 19. the Kenite, and the Kenizzite, and the Kadmonite;<br />20. and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Rephaim;<br />21. and the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Girgashite, and the Jebusite."<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} (in the text of <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1778/bible_king-james-version_genesis_15_1" target=_top>Genesis 15:1</a>). The Latin expression here translated "after these words" is a literal translation of the Hebrew, which in a more extended sense means "after these events."

The Phrath is the Euphrates. [LHC]<br />1778. Summary<br />THE inner sense here continues to speak of the Lord, in the period after he endured the battles and spiritual trials of his youth. These battles were severe assaults on the love he cherished for the whole human race and in particular for the church. Therefore, since he was anxious about what was in store, he received a promise. At the same time he was shown what the condition of the church would be toward the end, when it would begin to die. Still, a new church would be revived to take the place of the former one, and the heavenly kingdom would increase beyond measure. </p>

THE CONTENTS Here in the internal sense are continued the things concerning the Lord after He had endured in childhood the most severe combats of temptations, which were directed against the love which 
He cherished toward the whole human race, and in particular toward the church; and therefore being anxious concerning their future state a promise was made Him; but it was shown at the same time what 
the state of the church would become toward its end when it would begin to expire; but that still a new church should revive, which would take the place of the former, and the heavenly kingdom would 
be immensely increased. </p>

<p>Continued here in the internal sense are matters concerning the Lord after He had undergone in childhood the very severe conflicts brought about by temptations - conflicts directed against 
the love He cherished towards the entire human race, and in particular towards the Church. As He was therefore anxious about the future state of these, a promise was made to Him. But at the same time 
He was shown what the state of the Church was to become in its final days, when it was beginning to breathe its last, but nevertheless that a new Church would gather strength to take the place of the 
previous one; and the heavenly kingdom would be vastly increased. </p>

<p>CONTINUANTUR hic de Domino in sensu interno postquam in pueritia sustinuit gravissimas pugnas tentationum, et illas contra amorem quem fovit erga universum genus 
humanum, in specie erga Ecclesiam; quare anxius de futuro statu, Ipsi promissio facta; at una ostensum qualis status Ecclesiae fieret circa fines cum exspirare inciperet, sed usque quod nova Ecclesia 
revivisceret quae subitura loco prioris, et regnum caeleste immensum augeretur. </p>
