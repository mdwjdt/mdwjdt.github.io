<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2892节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2892.</strong>凡过着良善生活，相信主掌管整个宇宙，唯独祂是属于爱与仁的一切良善与属于信的一切真理的源头；甚至祂是全部生命的源头，因此我们生活、动作、存留，都在乎祂的人，就处在这样的状态中：他能被赋予天上的自由，以及伴随这自由的平安。因为这时，他唯独信靠主，并不挂虑其它事；他深信凡事都会趋向于他的良善、幸福和快乐，直到永远。但是，凡相信自己管理自己的人，则不断焦虑不安，被带入恶欲，以及对未来的挂碍中，从而被带入多种多样的焦虑中。由于他的这种信念，恶欲与谬念便粘附于他。</p>

He who lives in good, and believes that the Lord governs the universe, and that all the good which is of love and charity, and all the truth which is of faith, are from the Lord alone; nay, that life 
is from Him, and thus that from Him we live, move, and have our being, is in such a state that he can be gifted with heavenly freedom, and together with it with peace; for he then trusts solely in the 
Lord and has no care for other things, and is certain that all things are tending to his good, his blessedness, and his happiness to eternity. But he who believes that he governs himself is continually 
disquieted, being borne along into cupidities, and into solicitude respecting future things, and thus into manifold anxieties; and because he so believes, the cupidities of evil and the persuasions 
of falsity also adhere to him. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2892</b></p><p><b>2892.</b>
The state of one who leads a good life and who believes that the Lord governs the universe, and that He alone is the source of everything good that flows from love and charity, and of everything true 
that is a matter of faith, and indeed that He is the source of all life - thus the state of one who believes that 'in Him we live, and move, and have our being' - is such that he can have heavenly freedom 
conferred on him, and with that freedom peace as well. For he trusts solely in the Lord and has no anxious cares about all else; he is quite sure that all things work for his good, blessedness, 
and happiness for ever. But one who believes that he governs himself is constantly agitated, being carried along into evil desires, into anxious cares about things of the future, and thus into a vast 
number of anxieties. And such being his belief, evil desires and false persuasions also cling to him. </p>

</p><b>2892.</b>
Qui in bono vivit, et credit quod Dominus regat universum, et quod ab Ipso solo omne bonum quod est amoris et charitatis, et omne verum quod est fidei, immo quod ab Ipso vita, ita quod `ab Ipso vivamus, 
moveamur, et simus,' is in tali statu est ut donari possit libero caelesti, et cum hoc etiam pace, nam tunc unice {1}fidit Domino, et curat cetera nihil, {2}et certus est quod tunc omnia ad ejus 
bonum, beatum et felix in aeternum, tendant.  At qui credit semet ipsum regere, is continue inquietatur, fertur in cupiditates, in sollicitudines de futuris, et sic in multiplices anxietates; et quia 
ita credit, etiam cupiditates mali et persuasiones falsi ei adhaerent. @1 fidet AI$  @2 nam$  </p>
