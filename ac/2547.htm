<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2547节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2547.</strong>“你竟给我和我的国招来大罪”表信之教义和一切教义由此陷入危险之中。这从此处代词“我”所指的“亚比米勒”和“国”的含义清楚可知：“亚比米勒”是指信之教义，“国”是指教义的真理，或教义。“国”在内义上表教义的真理，在反义上则表教义的虚假。这一点从圣言明显看出来，如耶利米书：<br />祂是形成万有的，是祂产业的权杖；万军之耶和华是祂的名。你是我的棒槌和战器；我要用你来打碎列族，用你来毁灭列国（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶51.19.htm">51:19</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶51.20.htm">20</a>）<br />这论及主，显然，祂不会打碎列族，也不会毁灭列国，而是要打碎和毁灭列族和列国所表示的那些事物，即教义的邪恶与虚假。<br />以西结书：<br />看哪，我必将以色列人从他们所到的列族中收取回来，从四围聚集他们，带他们回到本地。我要使他们在那地，在以色列山上成为一族，有一王作他们众民的王。他们不再为二族，决不再分为二国。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结37.21.htm">37:21</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结37.22.htm">22</a>）<br />此处“以色列”表属灵的教会；“（民）族”表该教会或教义的良善，因为“民族”表良善（参看<a href="1259.htm">1259</a>，<a href="1260.htm">1260</a>，<a href="1416.htm">1416</a>，<a href="1849.htm">1849</a>节）。“国”表该教会的真理。很明显，“列族和列国”在此并非表示民族和国家，而是另有所指。因为经上说的是要被“聚集和带回本地”的以色列众人或以色列人，事实上，当时他们被分散在外邦列族中，已变成外邦人。<br />以赛亚书：<br />我必激动埃及人攻击埃及人，他们就打起仗来，各人攻打自己的弟兄，各人攻打自己的同伴，城攻打城，国攻打国。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛19.2.htm">19:2</a>）<br />此处“埃及”表基于对信之真理的记忆知识的推理（<a href="1164.htm">1164</a>，<a href="1165.htm">1165</a>，<a href="1186.htm">1186</a>节）；“城”表教义，在此表异端邪说（<a href="402.htm">402</a>，<a href="2268.htm">2268</a>，<a href="2449.htm">2449</a>节）；“国”表教义的虚假；因此，“城攻打城，国攻打国”表异端邪说和虚假会彼此攻打。主在马太福音中针对世代的末了所说的话意思也一样：<br />民族要起来攻打民族，国家要起来攻打国家。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.7.htm">24:7</a>）<br />这表示邪恶攻打邪恶，虚假攻打虚假。<br />但以理针对四国（2:37-46，7:17至末尾）、玛代和波斯的国（8:20至末尾）、南王和北王的国（11章）所预言的事，以及约翰在启示录中针对王和国所预言的事都没有其它含义。那些国只表示教会在真理与虚假方面的状态。字面上君王和世上国家的状态在内义上就是教会和主国家的状态。在内义上除了属灵和属天之物外，不会出现其它任何事物。因为就其本身而言，主的圣言纯粹是属灵和属天的；但为了让人-无论是谁，能读懂它，就用诸如世上的那类事物来阐述天上的事物。</p>

That thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin. That this signifies that thereby the doctrine of faith and all doctrinal things would be in danger, is evident from the signification of "Abimelech," 
here meant by "me," as being the doctrine of faith; and from the signification of "kingdom," as being the truth of doctrine or that which is doctrinal. That in the internal sense "kingdom" 
signifies the truths of doctrine; and in the opposite sense, falsities of doctrine, is evident from the Word; as in Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     He is the Former of all things, and the scepter of His inheritance Jehovah 
Zebaoth is His name. Thou art My hammer, weapons of war; and I will scatter nations in thee, and destroy kingdoms in thee (Jer. 51:19-20), where the Lord is treated of, who evidently will not 
scatter nations nor destroy kingdoms, but will scatter and destroy the things signified by nations and kingdoms, namely, the evils and falsities of doctrine. [2] In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Behold, I will take 
the sons of Israel from among the nations whither they be gone, and will gather them from every side, and bring them into their own land; I will make them one nation in the land in the mountains of Israel, 
and one king shall be king to them all; and they shall no more be two nations, neither shall they any more be divided into two kingdoms (Ezek. 37:21-22); </p>
<p>here "Israel" denotes the spiritual church; 
and "nation" the good of that church or of doctrine. (That "nations" denote goods may be seen above, n. 1259, 1260, 1416, 1849.) "Kingdom" denotes its truths. It is evident that something else than 
nations and kingdoms is here meant by "nations and kingdoms," for it is said of the sons of Israel or of the Israelites that they are to be "gathered and brought back into the land," the fact being 
that when dispersed among the nations they were transformed into Gentiles. [3] In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     I will confound Egypt with Egypt, and they shall fight every man against his brother, and every man against 
his companion, city against city, kingdom against kingdom (Isa. 19:2), where "Egypt" denotes reasonings from memory-knowledges concerning the truths of faith (n. 1164, 1165, 1186); "city" denotes 
doctrine, here one that is heretical (n. 402, 2268, 2449); "kingdom" denotes the falsity of doctrine; so that "city against city, and kingdom against kingdom" denotes that heresies and falsities will 
fight among themselves; in like manner as is denoted by what the Lord said in regard to the consummation of the age, in Matthew: </p>
<p>     Nation shall rise up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom 
(Matt. 24:7); </p>
<p>denoting evils against evils, and falsities against falsities. [4] That which Daniel prophesied in regard to the four kingdoms (chapter 2:37-46, 7:17 to the end); and concerning the 
kingdoms of Media and Persia (chapter 8:20 to the end); and concerning the kingdoms of the king of the south and the king of the north (chapter 11); and that which John prophesied in the Revelation 
concerning kings and kingdoms, have no other signification: "kingdoms" there merely mean the states of the church in respect to truths and falsities. States of monarchs and of the kingdoms of the earth 
in the sense of the letter, are in the internal sense states of the church and of the Lord's kingdom; in which sense there are none other than spiritual and celestial things; for regarded in itself 
the Lord's Word is solely spiritual and celestial; but in order that it may be read and apprehended by every man whatever, the things of heaven are set forth by such things as are on earth. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2547</b></p><p><b>2547.</b>
'That you have brought great sin on me and on my kingdom' means that thereby the doctrine of faith and all matters of doctrine would be at risk. This is clear from the meaning of 'Abimelech', to whom 
the pronoun 'me' refers here, as the doctrine of faith, and from the meaning of 'kingdom' as the truth of doctrine or that which is a matter of doctrine. That 'a kingdom' in the internal sense means 
truths of doctrine, and in the contrary sense falsities of doctrine, is clear from the Word, as in Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
He is the One who formed all things and the sceptre of His inheritance; Jehovah Zebaoth 
is His name. You are to me a hammer, weapons of war, and in You I will scatter the nations, and in You I will destroy the kingdoms. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2051:%2019,%2020&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 51: 19, 20</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the Lord who, it is clear, is not 
going to scatter nations or destroy kingdoms but to do so to things meant by nations and kingdoms, namely evils and falsities of doctrine. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
Behold, I will take the children of Israel 
from among the nations to where they have gone away, and will gather them from all around, and bring them into their own land; I will make them into one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel; 
and one King will be King to them all, and they will no longer be two nations, nor will they be divided any longer into two kingdoms. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2037:%2021,%2022&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 37: 21, 22</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Israel' stands for the spiritual Church, 
'nation' for the good of that Church, that is, of doctrine, for by 'nations' goods are meant, see <a href="1259.htm">1259</a>, <a href="1260.htm">1260</a>, <a href="1416.htm">1416</a>, <a href="1849.htm">1849</a>. 'Kingdom' stands for the truths of that Church. The fact that 'rations' and 
'kingdoms' here mean something different from nations and kingdoms is quite evident, for the children of Israel, or the Israelites, are spoken of as being gathered together and brought into the land 
when in fact they were dispersed among the gentile nations and became such themselves. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
I will confound Egypt with Egypt, and they will fight, every one against his brother, and every 
one against his companion, city against city, kingdom against kingdom. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2019:%202&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 19: 2</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'Egypt' stands for the reasonings based on facts concerning the truths of faith, <a href="1164.htm">1164</a>, <a href="1165.htm">1165</a>, <a href="1186.htm">1186</a>. 'City' 
stands for doctrine, in this case heretical doctrine, <a href="402.htm">402</a>, <a href="2268.htm">2268</a>, <a href="2449.htm">2449</a>, 'kingdom' for falsity of doctrine. 'City against city and kingdom against kingdom' therefore stands for the fact that heresies and 
falsities will be in conflict with one another. The same is meant by the following words spoken by the Lord in reference to the close of the age, in Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
Nation will be roused against nation 
and kingdom against kingdom. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2024:%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 24: 7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This stands for evils against evils, and falsities against falsities. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 The things that Daniel prophesied about the four kingdoms, Chapter 2: <a href="37.htm">37</a>-<a href="46.htm">46</a>; 7: <a href="17.htm">17</a>-end; and about the kingdoms of Media and Persia, Chapter 8: <a href="20.htm">20</a>-end; and about the kingdoms of the king of the south and the king of the north in Chapter <a href="11.htm">11</a>; and the things that John too prophesied 
in the Book of Revelation about kings and kingdoms, have no other meaning. Those kingdoms are used solely to mean states of the Church as regards truths and falsities. The conditions of monarchs and 
of earthly kingdoms in the sense of the letter are in the internal sense states of the Church and of the Lord's kingdom. In the internal sense nothing else occurs there than spiritual and celestial 
things, for regarded in itself the Word of the Lord is purely spiritual and celestial; but so that it may be read and understood by man, no matter who, ideas of the things which belong to heaven are conveyed 
by means of such things as exist on earth. </p>

`Quod adduxisti super me, et super regnum meum, peccatum grande': quod significet quod sic doctrina fidei et omnia doctrinalia in discrimine essent, constat a significatione `Abimelech qui hic est `me,' 
quod sit doctrina fidei, et ex significatione `regni' quod sit verum doctrinae seu doctrinale. Quod `regnum' in sensu interno significet vera doctrinae, et in sensu opposito falsa doctrina constat 
a Verbo, ut apud Jeremiam, 	Formator omnium Ille, et sceptrum hereditatis Ipsius, Jehovah Zebaoth nomen Ipsius; malleus Tu mihi, arma belli, dispergam in Te gentes, et perdam in Te regna, li 19, 20; </p>
<p>ubi 
de Domino, qui quod non `dispersurus gentes,' nec `perditurus regna' constat, sed quod illa quae per gentes et regna significantur, nempe mala et falsa quae sunt doctrinae: [2] apud Ezechielem, 	Ecce 
accepturus filios Israelis ab inter gentes quo abiverunt, et congregabo eos e circuitu, et adducam eos in terram suam, faciam eos in gentem unam in terra, in montibus Israelis, et Rex unus erit 
omnibus illis in Regem, et non erunt amplius in duas gentes, et non dividentur amplius in duo regna, xxxvii 21, 22; </p>
<p>Israel pro Ecclesia spirituali, `gens' pro bono (t)istius Ecclesiae' seu doctrinae; 
quod `gentes' sint bona, videatur n. 1259, 1260, 1416, 1849; `regnum' pro veris illius; quod per `gentes et regna' ibi aliud quam gentes et regna significetur, patet, nam dicitur de filiis Israelis 
seu Israelis, quod `congregandi et adducendi super terram,' qui tamen dispersi inter gentes abiverunt in gentes: [3] apud Esaiam, 	Confundam Aegyptum cum Aegypto, et pugnabunt vir contra fratrem suum, 
et vir contra socium suum, urbs contra urbem, regnum contra regnum, xix 2; </p>
<p>ubi `Aegyptus' pro ratiociniis ex scientificis de veris fidei, n. 1164, 1165, 1186; `urbs' pro doctrinali, hic haeretico, 
n. 402, 2268, 2449, regnum' pro falso doctrinalis, inde `urbs contra urbem, et regnum contra regnum' pro quod haereses et falsa inter se pugnatura; similiter ac per haec quae Dominus de consummatione 
saeculi locutus, apud Matthaeum, 	Excitabitur gens contra gentem, et regnum contra regnum, xxiv 7; </p>
<p>[4] (o)pro quod mala contra mala, et falsa contra falsa'.  (m)Quae Daniel prophetavit de quatuor regnis, 
ii 37-46, vii 17 ad fin. et de regnis Mediae et Persiae, viii 20 ad fin.; de regnis regis meridiei et regis septentrionis, xi; et quae Johannes in Apocalypsi etiam de regibus et regnis, nihil aliud 
significant; et per `regna' ibi modo status Ecclesiae quoad vera et falsa intelliguntur; status monarchici et regnorum terrae in sensu litterae sunt status Ecclesiae et regni Domini in sensu interno, 
in quo sensu nihil nisi quam spiritualia et caelestia sunt; Verbum enim Domini in se spectatum non est nisi spirituale et caeleste, sed ut legatur et capiatur ab homine quocumque, illa quae caeli 
sunt, per talia quae in terra traduntur.(n) </p>
