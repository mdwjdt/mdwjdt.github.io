Verses 5-7. And Jacob rose up from Beersheba; and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their babes, and their women, in the carts which Pharaoh had sent to carry him. And they took their 
cattle, and their acquisition which they had acquired in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him: his sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons' 
daughters, and all his seed, brought he with him into Egypt. "And Jacob rose up," signifies the enlightening of natural truth; "from Beersheba," signifies from the doctrine of charity and faith; "and 
the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father," signifies that truths which are spiritual caused natural truth to advance; "and their babes," signifies together with those things which are of innocence; 
"and their women," signifies and those things which are of charity; "in the carts which Pharaoh had sent to carry him," signifies doctrinals from the memory-knowledges of the church; "and they took 
their cattle," signifies the goods of truth; "and their acquisition which they had acquired in the land of Canaan," signifies truths procured from prior truths which are of the church; "and came into 
Egypt," signifies initiation into the memory-knowledges of the church; "Jacob, and all his seed with him," signifies of natural truth and of all things of faith appertaining thereto; "his sons, and 
his sons' sons with him," signifies truths in order; "his daughters, and his sons' daughters," signifies goods in order; "and all his seed" signifies everything of faith and of charity; "brought he with 
him into Egypt," signifies that they were brought into the memory-knowledges which are of the church. </p>

Verses 5-7 And Jacob rose up from Beersheba, and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their young children, and their wives, in the carts which Pharaoh sent to carry him. And they took 
their livestock, and the acquisitions they had made in the land of Canaan, and came to Egypt - Jacob and all his seed with him. His sons and his sons' sons with him, his daughters and his sons' daughters, 
and all his seed he brought with him to Egypt.  </p>
<p>'And Jacob rose up' means an enlightening of natural truth. 'From Beersheba' means from the doctrine of charity and faith. 'And the sons of Israel 
carried Jacob their father' means that truths which were spiritual ones caused natural truth to move ahead. 'And their young children' means accompanied by aspects of innocence. 'And their wives' means 
aspects of charity too. 'In the carts which Pharaoh sent to carry him' means the matters of doctrine obtained from the Church's factual knowledge. 'And they took their livestock' means forms of the 
good of truth. 'And the acquisitions they had made in the land of Canaan' means truths acquired from other truths which the Church already possessed. 'And came to Egypt' means the introduction into 
the Church's factual knowledge. 'Jacob and all his seed with him' means of natural truth and all matters of faith belonging to that truth. 'His sons and his sons' sons with him' means truths in their 
own order. 'His daughters and his sons daughters' means forms of good in their own order. 'And all his seed' means every integral part of faith and charity. 'He brought with him to Egypt' means that 
they were gathered together into the Church's factual knowledge. </p>

Vers. 5-7.  Et  surrexit Jacob e Beersheba, et tulerunt filii Israelis Jacobum patrem suum, et infantes suos, et mulieres suas, in vehiculis quae misit Pharaoh ad ferendum illum.  Et acceperunt pecus 
suum, et acquisitionem suam quam acquisiverunt in terra Canaan, et venerunt Aegyptum, Jacob et omne semen ejus cum illo.  Filios suos et filios filiorum suorum secum, filias suas et filias filiorum 
suorum, et omne semen suum, adduxit secum Aegyptum.  `Et surrexit Jacob' significat elucidationem veri naturalis:  `e Beersheba' significat ex doctrina charitatis et fidei:  `et tulerunt filii Israelis
