<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7263.</strong>这些名字之所以出现在圣言中，是因为那些处于外在敬拜的人会向字面上被如此称呼的人行仁爱；而那些处于内在敬拜的人则向属灵理解的那类人行仁爱。因此，简单人会以简单的方式理解并行出圣言，而智慧人则以智慧的方式理解并行出圣言；也是为了叫简单人能通过仁爱的外在形式被引入仁爱的内在形式。</p>

The reason why these same names are in the Word, is that they who were in external worship were to exercise charity toward such as were so named; and they who were in internal worship, toward such spiritually 
understood; thus that the simple might understand and do the Word simply, and the wise wisely; also in order that the simple might be initiated by means of the externals of charity into its 
internals. </p>
<p>     EXODUS 7 </p>
<p>     1. And Jehovah said unto Moses, See, I have given thee a god to Pharaoh; and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet.      2. Thou shalt speak all that I command thee, 
and Aaron thy brother shall speak unto Pharaoh, and let him send the sons of Israel out of his land.      3. And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply My signs and My wonders in the land of 
Egypt.      4. And Pharaoh will not hear you; and I will give My hand upon the Egyptians, and lead forth My armies, My people, the sons of Israel, out of the land of Egypt, with great judgments.   
   5. And the Egyptians shall know that I am Jehovah, when I stretch forth My hand upon Egypt, and lead forth the sons of Israel from the midst of them.      6. And Moses and Aaron did so; as Jehovah 
commanded them, so did they.      7. And Moses was a son of eighty years, and Aaron a son of three and eighty years, when they spoke unto Pharaoh.      8. And Jehovah said unto Moses and unto Aaron, 
saying,       9. When Pharaoh shall say unto you, saying, Give you a wonder, and thou shalt say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast it before Pharaoh, it shall become a water-serpent.      10. And 
Moses and Aaron came unto Pharaoh, and they did so as Jehovah had commanded; and Aaron cast his rod before Pharaoh and before his servants, and it became a water-serpent.      11. And Pharaoh called 
also the wise men and the sorcerers; and they also, the magicians of Egypt, did so with their enchantments.      12. And they cast forth every man his rod, and they became water-serpents; and Aaron's 
rod swallowed up their rods.      13. And Pharaoh's heart was made firm, and he heard them not; as Jehovah had spoken.      14. And Jehovah said unto Moses, Pharaoh's heart is made heavy, he refuseth 
to let the people go.      15. Go unto Pharaoh in the morning; behold he goeth out unto the waters; and stand thou to meet him near the bank of the river; and the rod which was turned into a serpent 
take in thy hand.      16. And thou shalt say unto him, Jehovah the God of the Hebrews hath sent me unto thee, saying, Let My people go, that they may serve Me in the wilderness; and behold hitherto 
thou hast not heard.      17. Thus said Jehovah, In this thou shalt know that I am Jehovah; behold I smite with the rod that is in my hand upon the waters which are in the river, and they shall be 
turned into blood.      18. And the fish that is in the river shall die, and the river shall stink; and the Egyptians shall labor to drink waters from the river.      19. And Jehovah said unto Moses, 
Say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and stretch out thy hand over the waters of Egypt, over their streams, over their rivers, and over their pools, and over every gathering of their waters, and they shall 
be blood; and there shall be blood in all the land of Egypt, both in the woods and in the stones.      20. And Moses and Aaron did so, as Jehovah commanded; and he lifted up the rod, and smote the 
waters that were in the river, unto the eyes of Pharaoh, and unto the eyes of his servants; and all the waters that were in the river were turned into blood.       21. And the fish that was in the river 
died; and the river stank, and the Egyptians could not drink water from the river; and there was blood in all the land of Egypt.      22. And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments; 
and Pharaoh's heart was made firm, and he heard them not, as Jehovah had spoken.      23. And Pharaoh looked back, and came unto his house, and did not set his heart even to this.      24. And all 
the Egyptians digged round about the river for waters to drink; for they could not drink of the waters of the river.      25. And seven days were fulfilled after that Jehovah had smitten the river.  
    26.* And Jehovah said unto Moses, Come unto Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Let My people go, and let them serve Me.      27. And if thou refuse to let them go, behold I will smite 
all thy border with frogs.      28. And the river shall make frogs to creep forth, and they shall go up and come into thy house, and into thy bedchamber, and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy 
servants, and into that of thy people, and into thine ovens, and into thy kneading-troughs.      29. And on thee, and on thy people, and on all thy servants, shall the frogs go up. * Numbered as in 
the Hebrew; in the English text Chapter VIII. begins with this verse. </p>

The reason why these same names occur in the Word is that those whose worship was external would exercise charity towards the kind of people meant literally by such names, while those whose worship was 
internal would exercise it towards people meant spiritually by them. Thus it was that the simple would understand and carry out the Word in a simple manner, and the wise in a wise manner; and also 
that the simple would be introduced by means of external forms of charity to internal forms of it. </p>

Quod eadem illa nomina in Verbo sint, est quia illi qui in externo cultu erant erga tales qui ita nominabantur charitatem exercerent; et qui in interno cultu, erga tales spiritualiter intellectos; ita 
quod simplices simpliciter intelligerent et facerent Verbum, et (x)quod sapientes sapienter; tum quoque, ut simplices per externa charitatis initiarentur in interna ejus. CAPUT VII 	1.  Et dixit 
JEHOVAH ad Moschen, Vide, dedi te deum Pharaoni, et Aharon frater tuus erit propheta tuus. 	2.  Tu loqueris omne quod praecepero tibi; et Aharon frater tuus loquetur ad Pharaonem, et mittat filios Israelis 
e terra sua. 	3.  Et Ego obdurabo cor Pharaonis, et multiplicabo signa Mea et prodigia Mea, in terra Aegypti. 	4.  Et non audiet ad vos Pharao; et dabo manum Meam in Aegyptios, et educam exercitus 
Meos, populum Meum, filios Israelis, e terra Aegypti, judiciis magnis. 	5.  Et cognoscent Aegyptii quod Ego JEHOVAH, in extendere Me manum Meam super {1}Aegyptios, et eduxero filios Israelis e 
medio illorum. 	@1 Aegyptum I$ 	6.  Et fecit Moscheh et Aharon, quemadmodum praecipit JEHOVAH illis, ita fecerunt. 	7.  Et Moscheh filius octoginta annorum, et Aharon filius trium et octoginta annorum, 
in loqui illos ad Pharaonem. 	8.  Et dixit JEHOVAH ad Moschen et ad Aharonem, dicendo, 	9.  Quod cum dixerit ad vos Pharao, dicendo, Date vobis prodigium; et dices ad Aharonem, Accipe baculum tuum, 
et projice coram Pharaone, erit in serpentem aqueum. 	10.  Et venit Moscheh et Aharon ad Pharaonem, et fecerunt ita quemadmodum praecepit JEHOVAH, et projecit Aharon baculum suum coram Pharaone, 
et coram servis illius, et factus in serpentem aqueum. 	11.  Et vocavit etiam Pharao sapientes et praestigiatores, et fecerunt etiam illi, magi Aegypti, incantationibus suis ita. 	12.  Et projecerunt 
quisque baculum suum, et facti in serpentes aqueos; et deglutivit baculus Aharonis baculos illorum. 	13.  Et obfirmatum cor Pharaonis, et non audivit ad illos, quemadmodum locutus JEHOVAH. 	14.  
Et dixit JEHOVAH ad Moschen, Ingravatum est cor Pharaonis, renuit mittere populum. 	15.  Vade ad Pharaonem in matutino, ecce egreditur ad aquas, et {1}consistes obviam illi juxta ripam fluminis, et baculum 
qui versus in serpentem accipe in manum tuam. 	@1 consiste I$ 	16.  Et dices ad illum, JEHOVAH DEUS Hebraeorum misit me ad te, dicendo, Mitte populum Meum, {1}et serviant Mihi in deserto, et 
ecce non audivisti usque huc. 	@1 ut I$ 	17.  Ita dixit JEHOVAH, In hoc cognosces quod Ego JEHOVAH, ecce ego percutio baculo qui in manu mea, super aquas quae in fluvio, et vertentur in sanguinem. 	18. 
 Et piscis qui in fluvio morietur, et putebit fluvius, et laborabunt Aegyptii ad bibendum aquas e fluvio. 	19.  Et dixit JEHOVAH ad Moschen, Dic ad Aharonem, Accipe baculum tuum, et extende manum 
tuam super aquas Aegypti, super flumina illorum, super fluvios illorum, et super stagna illorum, et super omnem congregationem aquarum illorum, et erunt sanguis; et erit sanguis in omni terra Aegypti, 
et in lignis et in lapidibus. 	20.  Et fecerunt ita Moscheh et Aharon quemadmodum praecepit JEHOVAH, et sustulit baculum, et percussit aquas quae in fluvio, ad oculos Pharaonis, et ad oculos servorum 
illius; et conversae sunt omnes aquae quae in fluvio in sanguinem. 	21.  Et piscis qui in fluvio moriebatur, et putuit fluvius, et non potuerunt Aegyptii bibere aquam ex fluvio; et fuit sanguis in 
tota terra Aegypti. 	22.  Et fecerunt ita magi Aegypti incantationibus suis; et obfirmatum cor Pharaonis, et non audivit ad illos, quemadmodum locutus JEHOVAH. 	23.  Et respexit Pharao, et venit ad 
domum suam, et non posuit cor suum etiam ad hoc. 	24.  Et foderunt omnes Aegyptii circum fluvium aquas ad bibendum, quia non potuerunt bibere ex aquis fluvii. 	25.  Et impleti septem dies postquam 
percutere JEHOVAH fluvium. 	{1}26.  Et dixit JEHOVAH ad Moschen, Veni ad Pharaonem, (x)et dices ad illum, Ita dicit JEHOVAH, Mitte populum Meum, et serviant Mihi. 	@1 AV viii L begins here.$ 	27.
