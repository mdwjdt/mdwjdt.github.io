<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5005节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5005.</strong>“家中的男丁没有一个人在那屋里”表没有任何人的帮助。这从以下事实清楚可知：这句话意味着约瑟是独自一人；因为“约瑟”在内义上描述了主，描述祂如何荣耀祂的内在人身，或使它变成神性；这些话表示祂做这一切并没有任何人的帮助。主凭自己的能力使祂的人身变成神性，因而没有任何人的帮助，这一点从以下事实可以看出来：因为祂从耶和华成孕，神性在祂里面，因而神性是祂的；所以当来到世上，使祂自己里面的这人身变成神性时，祂是凭自己的神性，或凭祂自己这样做的。这在以赛亚书是以下面的话来描述的：<br />那从以东而来，从波斯拉而出，穿红衣服、装扮华美、能力充沛的是谁呢？我独自踹酒榨，众民中无一人与我同在。我仰望，见无人帮助；我诧异，没有人扶持。所以我自己的膀臂为我施行拯救。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛63.1.htm">63:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛63.3.htm">3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛63.5.htm">5</a>）<br />同一先知书：<br />祂见没有一个人，无人代求，甚为诧异，就用自己的膀臂施行拯救，以公义扶持自己。祂以公义为铠甲，以拯救为头盔。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛59.16.htm">59:16</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛59.17.htm">17</a>）<br />主凭自己的能力使自己里面的人身变成神性，这一点可参看前文（<a href="1616.htm">1616</a>，<a href="1749.htm">1749</a>，<a href="1755.htm">1755</a>，<a href="1812.htm">1812</a>，<a href="1813.htm">1813</a>，<a href="1921.htm">1921</a>，<a href="1928.htm">1928</a>，<a href="1999.htm">1999</a>，<a href="2025.htm">2025</a>，<a href="2026.htm">2026</a>，<a href="2083.htm">2083</a>，<a href="2500.htm">2500</a>，<a href="2523.htm">2523</a>，<a href="2776.htm">2776</a>，<a href="3043.htm">3043</a>，<a href="3141.htm">3141</a>，<a href="3381.htm">3381</a>，<a href="3382.htm">3382</a>，<a href="3637.htm">3637</a>，<a href="4286.htm">4286</a>节）。</p>

And no man of the men of the house was there in the house. That this signifies that it was without the aid of anyone is evident from the fact that hereby is signified that he was alone; and because in 
the internal sense by "Joseph" is signified the Lord, and how He glorified His internal Human, or made it Divine, by these words is signified that He did this without the aid of anyone. That the Lord 
made His Human Divine by His own power, thus without the aid of anyone, may be seen from the fact that because He was conceived of Jehovah, the Divine was in Him, and thus the Divine was His; and therefore 
when He was in the world, and made the Human in Himself Divine, He did this from His own Divine, or from Himself. This is described in Isaiah in the words: </p>
<p>	Who is this that cometh from Edom, 
with dyed garments from Bozrah? this that is honorable in His apparel, marching in the multitude of His strength? I have trodden the wine-press alone; and of the peoples there was no man with Me. I looked 
but there was no one helping: and I was amazed, but there was no one upholding; therefore Mine own arm brought salvation to Me (Isa. 63:1, 3, 5). And again in the same prophet: </p>
<p>	He saw that there 
was no man, and was as it were amazed that there was no one interceding; therefore His own arm brought salvation to Him; and His righteousness stirred Him up. Therefore He put on righteousness as 
a coat of mail, and a helmet of salvation upon His head (Isa. 59:16-17). (That the Lord by His own power made the Human in Himself Divine may be seen above, n. 1616, 1749, 1755, 1812, 1813, 1921, 1928, 
1999, 2025, 2026, 2083, 2500, 2523, 2776, 3043, 3141, 3381, 3382, 3637, 4286.) </p>

'And none of the men of the house was there in the house' means without the help of any other. This becomes clear from the fact that this statement means that Joseph was alone; and because in the internal 
sense 'Joseph' is descriptive of the Lord, of how He glorified His Internal Human or made this Divine, these words are used to mean that He made it so without the help of any other. This truth that 
the Lord made His Human Divine by His own power, and so without the help of any other, may be recognized from the consideration that because He was conceived from Jehovah, the Divine was within Him, 
and thus that the Divine was His own. Therefore when He was in the world and made the Human within Him Divine, He did so with the aid of the Divine, which was His own, that is, He did it by Himself. 
This is described in Isaiah as follows, </p>
<blockquote>
Who is this who is coming from Edom, with spattered clothes from Bozra, He that is glorious in His apparel, marching in the vast numbers of His strength? I 
have trodden the winepress alone, and from the peoples no man was with Me. I looked about but there was none helping, and I wondered, but there was not one to uphold; therefore My own arm brought salvation 
to Me. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2063:1,%203,%205&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 63:1, 3, 5</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And elsewhere in the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
He saw that there was no man, and as it were wondered that there was no intercessor; therefore His own arm brought salvation to 
Him, and His righteousness lifted Him up. Consequently He put on righteousness as a breastplate, and a helmet of salvation upon His head. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2059:16,%2017&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 59:16, 17</a>.

`Et nullus vir e viris domus ibi in domo': quod significet quod absque ullius auxilio, constare potest ex eo quod per id significetur quod solus esset; et quia in sensu interno per `Josephum' agitur 
de Domino quomodo ipse Humanum (t)Internum Suum glorificavit seu Divinum fecit, intelligitur per illa verba quod id fecerit absque ullius auxilio.  Quod Dominus Humanum Suum Divinum fecerit ex 
propria potentia, ita absque ullius auxilio, constare potest ex eo quod quia a Jehovah conceptus, Divinum esset in Ipso, et sic quod Divinum esset Ipsius {1}; quapropter cum fuit in mundo, et Humanum 
in Se Divinum fecit, ex Divino Suo seu ex (t)Se Ipso fecit: id describitur ita apud Esaiam, </p>
<p>          Quis hic qui venit ex Edom, conspersus vestes ex      Bozra?  hic honorabilis in vestitu Suo, 
incedens in      multitudine roboris Sui?... Torcular calcavi solus, et de      populis non vir Mecum..... Circumspexi, sed non      auxilians, et obstupui, sed non suffulciens; ideo salutem  
    praestitit Mihi brachium Meum, lxiii 1, 3, 5: </p>
<p> et alibi apud eundem, </p>
<p>          Vidit quod non vir, et quasi obstupuit, quod non      esset intercedens; ideo salutem praestitit Ipsi brachium  
    Ipsius; et justitia Ipsius suscitavit Ipsum; unde induit      justitiam sicut loricam, et galeam salutis super caput      Suum, lix 16 [17]. </p>
<p>Quod Dominus {2} propria potentia Humanum in Se 
Divinum fecerit, videatur n. 1616, 1749, 1755, 1812, 1813, 1921, 1928, 1999, 2025, 2026, 2083, 2500, 2523, 2776, 3043, 3141, 3382, 3637, 4286. @1 i, Divinum enim erat Ipsum Esse vitae Ipsius$ @2 i ex$ </p>
