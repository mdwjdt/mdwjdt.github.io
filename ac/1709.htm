<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1709.</strong>“三百一十八人”表这些良善的性质，也就是说，它们是争战中所利用的神圣事物，就包含在数字“一十八”和“三百”中，因为这些数字由三和六组成。“三”表神圣之物（如前所示，<a href="720.htm">720</a>，<a href="901.htm">901</a>节）；“六”表争战（如前所示，<a href="737.htm">737</a>，<a href="900.htm">900</a>节）。亚伯兰率领这么多人是真实的历史，但仍具有代表性。圣言中的所有历史都是这样，如摩西五经，约书亚记，士师记，撒母耳记，列王记，但以理书，约拿书，那里的数字同样包含奥秘。因为圣言中记载的事无不具有这样的代表性，否则，它就不是圣言，也不会记载亚伯兰率领他家里生养的精练壮丁三百一十八人，以及本章中提及的许多其它细节。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1709.</strong> Three hundred eighteen men symbolizes the quality of that goodness, specifically the holiness of the struggle. The number eighteen involves this symbolism, and so does the number three hundred, because three and six are factors of both. Three symbolizes something holy, as shown in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1709/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_720" target=_top>720</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1709/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_901" target=_top>901</a>, and six symbolizes struggle, as shown in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1709/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_737" target=_top>737</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1709/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_900" target=_top>900</a>.<br />It is a historical fact that Abram mustered this many men, and yet it still represented something. So did every historical fact in the Word — in the five books of Moses, as well as in Joshua, Judges, Samuel, Kings, Daniel, and Jonah, in all of which the numbers likewise involve hidden meanings. Nothing was written in the Word that did not represent something. Otherwise it would not be the Word. Otherwise it would never have mentioned that Abram mustered 318 men, or that they were trainees and offspring of his household, and so on with many other details given in this chapter. </p>

Three hundred and eighteen men. That this signifies their quality, namely, that they are the holy things of combat, is involved in the number "eighteen," and also in the number "three hundred;" for these 
numbers are composed of three and six. "Three" signifies what is holy (as shown n. 720, 901); and "six" combat (as shown n. 737, 900). That Abram hastened so many, is an historical truth but still 
it was representative, as is all the history in the Word in the five books of Moses, in Joshua, in Judges, in Samuel, in the Kings, in Daniel, and in Jonah, where the numbers in like manner involve 
arcana; for nothing has been written in the Word which was not of this nature, otherwise it would not be the Word, and otherwise it would not have been related that Abram hastened three hundred and eighteen; 
and also that these were in training, and born in his house; besides many other things which are said in this chapter. </p>

'Three hundred and eighteen men' means the nature of those goods, that is to say, they are the holy things employed in conflict. The number eighteen entails this, as also does the number three hundred, 
for these numbers are compounded from three and six. Three means that which is holy, as shown in <a href="720.htm">720</a>, <a href="901.htm">901</a>, and six means conflict, as shown in <a href="737.htm">737</a>, <a href="900.htm">900</a>. Abram's bringing out of such a number of men 
is true historically; but still it was also representative, as is every historical detail of the Word recorded in the five Books of Moses, and in the Books of Joshua, Judges, Samuel, Kings, Daniel, and 
Jonah, where in like manner numbers embody arcana within them For nothing has been written in the Word that was not of such a representative nature. If it were not representative it would not be the 
Word and it would never have been recorded that Abram brought out three hundred and eighteen, and also that they were trained and were born in his house, besides many other details mentioned in this chapter. </p>

</p><b>1709.</b>
'Octodecim et trecentos viros': quod significet qualitatem eorum, nempe quod sint sancta pugnae, numerus 'octodecim' hoc involvit, tum quoque numerus 'trecentorum,' sunt enim hi numeri compositi ex 
tribus et sex; 'tria' significant sanctum, ut ostensum, n. 720, 901; et 'sex' pugnam, ut ostensum n. 737, 900. Quod Abram tot expediverit, historicum verum est, sed usque repraesentativum fuit, sicut 
omne historicum Verbi in Libris quinque Mosis, in Josuae, in Judicum, in Samuelis, in Regum, in Danielis, inque Jonae, ubi similiter numeri involvunt arcana; nam nihil in Verbo scriptum est quod non fuit 
tale, aliter non foret Verbum, et aliter nusquam memoratum quod Abram octodecim et trecentos expediverit, tum quod illi fuissent 'initiati et nati domus,' praeter plura quae in hoc capite dicuntur. </p>
