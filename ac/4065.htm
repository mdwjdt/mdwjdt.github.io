<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4065节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4065.</strong>“并借着我们父亲的，得了这一切的财富”表主将它赋予自己。这从“得了财富”的含义清楚可知，“得了财富”是指赋予祂自己。因为就至高意义而言，这句话论及主，主决不会从别人那里取得任何良善与真理，而只从祂自己那里取得。诚然，与祂来自母亲的人身有关的其它良善作为一种手段而服务于祂；因为表示这种良善的拉班是利百加，就是雅各母亲的哥哥。不过，祂通过居间良善为自己所获得的那些事物，被祂用来凭自己的能力将其属世层变成神性。从一种手段中为自己获得某种事物是一回事，通过一种手段为自己获得某种事物是一回事。主之所以通过一种手段获得良善，是因为祂生而为人，从母亲那里所得来的某种遗传物是要被逐出的。然而，祂并非从这种手段中获得任何事物，因为祂从耶和华成孕，从耶和华而拥有神性。所以，祂将祂使之变成神性的一切良善与真理都赋予自己。因为神性本身不需要任何人，甚至不需要这居间良善，除非祂愿意一切事物要照着次序成就。</p>

And from that which was our father's hath he made all this abundance. That this signifies that He gave them to Himself, is evident from the signification of "making abundance," as being to give to Himself; 
for in the supreme sense this is predicated of the Lord, who never took anything of good and truth from another, but only from Himself. Other good that was related to His maternal human had indeed 
served Him as a means; for Laban, by whom that good is signified, was the brother of Rebekah, who was Jacob's mother; but by that mediate good He procured for Himself those things whereby He made 
His natural Divine by His own power. It is one thing to acquire something from a means, and another to acquire it by a means. The Lord acquired good by a means, because He was born a man, and derived 
from the mother an hereditary which was to be expelled; but He did not acquire good from a means, because He was conceived of Jehovah, from whom He had the Divine; and He therefore gave Himself all the 
goods and truths which He made Divine. For the Divine Itself has need of none, not even of that mediate good; except that He willed that all things should be done according to order. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4065</b></p><p><b>4065.</b>
'And from what belonged to our father he has gained all this wealth' means that He gave it to Himself. This is clear from the meaning of 'gaining wealth' as giving to oneself. For the highest sense has 
reference to the Lord, who in no way took anything of what was good and true from anybody else, only from Himself. Another type of good had served Him, it is true, as a means, a good which was related 
to the maternal side of Him, for Laban, who means that good, was the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's mother. But through that means He acquired to Himself the things by which He made His Natural Divine 
by His own power. It is one thing to acquire something to oneself from a means and another to do so through a means. He acquired them through that means because He was born a human being and derived 
from the mother something hereditary which had been cast away. He did not however acquire anything from that means since He was conceived from Jehovah from whom He had the Divine. Consequently He gave 
Himself all the goods and truths which He made Divine. For the Divine Himself has no need of anyone, not even of that intermediate good, except that His will was that everything should be done in keeping 
with order. </p>

</p><b>4065.</b>
`Et a quibus patri nostro, fecit omnem copiam hanc': quod significet quod Ipse Sibi daret, constat a significatione `facere copiam' quod sit sibi dare; praedicatur enim in sensu supremo de Domino, 
Qui nusquam aliquid boni et veri ab alio sumpsit, sed a Semet Ipso; inserviverat quidem Ipsi bonum aliud pro medio, quod cognationem habuit etiam cum materno, Laban enim per quem illud bonum significatur, 
erat frater Rebeccae quae mater Jacobi, sed per medium illud Sibi comparavit illa per quae Naturale Suum propria potentia Divinum fecit; aliud est ex medio aliquid sibi comparare, et aliud 
per medium; per medium Sibi comparavit, quia natus est homo et a matre hereditarium traxit quod expellendum, non autem ex medio, quia conceptus a Jehovah a Quo Divinum Ipsi, quare Sibi Ipsi dedit 
(o)omnia bona et vera quae Divina fecit; Ipsum enim ut omnia secundum ordinem fierent. </p>
