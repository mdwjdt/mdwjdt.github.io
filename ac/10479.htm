<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10479节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10479</strong>.“摩西见百姓放肆”表内在发觉这个民族背离内在之物，从而背离神性。这从“见”和“放肆”的含义，以及“摩西”的代表清楚可知：“见”是指发觉；“摩西”是指内在（参看<a href="10468.htm">10468</a>节）；“放肆”是指背离，在此是指背离内在之物，从而背离神性，正如前面所解释的（<a href="10472.htm">10472</a>节）。此外，在原文，这个词表示转身后退，以及变得赤裸；“变得赤裸”表示被剥夺爱之良善和信之真理，而它们构成教会及其敬拜的内在事物（<a href="9960.htm">9960</a>节）。</p>

And Moses saw the people that it was lax. That this signifies that it was perceived by the internal that that nation had turned away from what is internal, thus from the Divine, is evident from the signification 
of "seeing," as being to perceive; from the representation of Moses, as being the internal (see above, n. 10468); and from the signification of "lax," as being to be turned away, here from 
what is internal, thus from the Divine, according to what was unfolded above (n. 10472). Moreover, by this word in the original tongue is signified to be turned away and to go back, and also to be stripped; 
and by being "stripped" is signified to be deprived of the good of love and the truth of faith, which are the internals of the church and of its worship (n. 9960). </p>

'And Moses saw that the people had become undisciplined' means that the internal perceived that this nation had turned away from what was internal and so from what was Divine. This is clear from the 
meaning of 'seeing' as perceiving; from the representation of 'Moses' as the internal, dealt with above in <a href="10468.htm">10468</a>; and from the meaning of 'becoming undisciplined' as turning away, at this point away from 
what is internal, and so from what is Divine, as accords with the explanation above in <a href="10472.htm">10472</a>. The word used in the original language furthermore means to turn away and retreat, also to be made naked; 
and 'to be made naked' means to be stripped of the good of love and the truths of faith, which constitute the internal things of the Church and its worship, <a href="9960.htm">9960</a>.  </p>

`Et vidit Moscheh populum quod dissolutus ille': quod significet perceptum ab interno quod gens illa aversa esset ab interno, ita a Divino, constat ex significatione `videre' quod sit percipere, ex 
repraesentatione `Moschis' quod sit internum, de qua supra n. 10,468, et ex significatione `dissolutum esse' quod sit aversum esse, hic ab interno, ita a Divino, secundum illa quae supra n. 10,472; explicata 
sunt; per illam vocem in lingua originali etiam significatur aversum esse, ac retrocedere, tum nudatum esse, et per `nudatum' significatur {1} deprivatum {2} bono amoris et {3}veris fidei, quae 
sunt interna Ecclesiae et ejus cultus, n. 9960. @1 i etiam$ @2 i a$ @3 vero$ </p>
