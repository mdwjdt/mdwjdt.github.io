<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1227节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>1227．“以拦、亚述、亚法撒、路德、亚兰”是指众多民族。这从圣言中提及他们的历史和预言部分清楚可知；他们表智慧的属性，这一点从刚才所述，以及下文清楚可知。内在教会就存在于这些民族中，而外在教会则存在于名为“雅弗的儿子”的其它民族当中。败坏的内在教会存在于那些名为“含的儿子”的人当中，而败坏的外在教会则存在于那些名为“迦南的儿子”的人当中。无论是说内在和外在敬拜，还是说内在和外在教会，都是一回事。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1227.</strong> The fact that Elam, Asshur, Arpachshad, Lud, and Aram were individual nations is evident from the places they are mentioned in the narrative and prophetic parts of the Word.{*1} Their symbolism as attributes that are forms of wisdom can be seen from the remarks just above and by ones that follow too.<br />The inner church existed among these nations; the outer church existed among others referred to as Japheth's children; the inner church once it was corrupted, among those called Ham's children; and the outer church corrupted, among those called Canaan's children. (Whether one says inward and outward worship or inner and outer church, it is exactly the same.)<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} According to the Bible, Elam was the eponymous ancestor of the Elamites. Scholars identify them with an ancient civilization that flourished from around 2700-539 b.c.e. in the west and southwest of today's Iran (including Ilam province) as well as parts of southern Iraq. Elam (either the son of Shem or the land to which he gave his name) is mentioned in passing in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1227/bible_king-james-version_genesis_14_1" target=_top>Genesis 14:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1227/bible_king-james-version_genesis_14_9" target=_top>9</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1227/bible_king-james-version_1-chronicles_1_17" target=_top>1 Chronicles 1:17</a>; and more often in the prophets, including <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1227/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_49_34-39" target=_top>Jeremiah 49:34-39</a>. Asshur is the eponymous father of the Assyrian nation; he or the nation is mentioned in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1227/bible_king-james-version_numbers_24_22" target=_top>Numbers 24:22</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1227/bible_king-james-version_numbers_24_24" target=_top>24</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1227/bible_king-james-version_1-chronicles_1_17" target=_top>1 Chronicles 1:17</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1227/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_27_23" target=_top>Ezekiel 27:23</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1227/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_32_22" target=_top>32:22</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1227/bible_king-james-version_hosea_14_3" target=_top>Hosea 14:3</a>. Arpachshad is not associated with any particular nation, although according to the biblical genealogy he is the direct ancestor of Abraham (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1227/bible_king-james-version_genesis_11_10-26" target=_top>Genesis 11:10-26</a>); he is not mentioned by the prophets. The descendants of Lud are sometimes believed to have lived east of Elam, but their exact identity is unknown. They are sometimes confused with the Ludim, or Lydians (see note 1 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1227/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1195" target=_top>1195</a>), and are mentioned in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1227/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_66_19" target=_top>Isaiah 66:19</a> and <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1227/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_27_10" target=_top>Ezekiel 27:10</a>. Aram is associated with Syria and, loosely, with Mesopotamia as a whole (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1227/bible_king-james-version_numbers_23_7" target=_top>Numbers 23:7</a>). Aram is not mentioned by the prophets. [RS, SS] </p>

That "Elam, Asshur, Arpachshad, Lud, and Aram" were so many nations, is evident from the historical and prophetical parts of the Word where they are mentioned. And that they signify things that are of 
wisdom, is evident from what has been said just above, and from what follows. Among these nations there was an internal church; with others, who were called sons of Japheth, there was an external church; 
with those who were called sons of Ham there was a corrupted internal church; and with those who were sons of Canaan there was a corrupted external church. Whether it be said internal and external 
worship, or an internal and an external church, it is quite the same. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1227</b></p><p><b>1227.</b>
That 'Elam, Asshur, Arpachshad, Lud, and Aram' were just so many nations is clear from historical and prophetical sections of the Word where they are mentioned; and that they mean the attributes of wisdom 
is clear from what has been stated just above and is also stated below. Among these nations an internal Church existed, among others called 'the sons of Japheth' an external Church existed. Among 
those referred to as 'the sons of Ham' there was a corrupted internal Church, and among those called 'the sons of Canaan' a corrupted external Church. Whether one speaks of internal and external worship, 
or of an internal and an external Church, it amounts to the same thing. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1227</b>
</p><b>1227.</b>
Quod 'Elam, Asshur, Arpachshad, Lud et Aram' fuerint totidem gentes, constat a Verbi historicis et propheticis ubi nominantur; et quod per illas significentur illa quae sunt sapientiae, constat ex illis 
quae mox supra dicta, tum a sequentibus.  Apud has gentes fuit Ecclesia interna; apud alias quae 'filii Japheti' appellantur, Ecclesia externa; apud ea, quae 'filii Hami' vocantur, Ecclesia corrupta 
interna; et apud eas quae 'filii Canaanis' Ecclesia corrupta externa; sive dicatur cultus internus et externus, sive Ecclesia interna et externa, perinde est. </p>
