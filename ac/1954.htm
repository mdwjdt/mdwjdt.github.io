<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1954节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1954.</strong>“你是看见我的神”表流注。这从刚才所述清楚可知。看的行为从高层进入低，或也可说，从内层进入外层，就被称为流注，因为它凭流注进行。人的内视也是这种情形：若非其内视不断流入其外视，也就是眼睛的视觉，眼睛决不能关注并辨别任何物体。因为正是内视透过眼睛关注眼睛所看到的事物。眼睛决无法这样做，尽管表面上它看似能。由此可见，人若相信是眼睛在看，就会被感官幻觉所左右。而事实上，是其灵的视觉，也就是他的内视透过眼睛在看。<br />与我同在的灵人透过我的眼睛看到这个世界的事物，和我本人看得一样清楚（对此，参看<a href="1880.htm">1880</a>节）。然而，其中有些灵人仍被感官幻觉所左右，以为他们是透过自己的眼睛在看。但他们被展示事实并非如此，因为当我闭上眼睛时，他们就看不到物质世界的任何事物了。人也是如此：不是眼睛在看，而是他的灵藉着眼睛在看。这一点也可从梦明显看出来，人有时在梦中看得和白天一样清晰。这和内视，也就是灵的视觉的情形非常相似。这内视也不是凭自己在看，而是通过更内在的视觉，也就是理性视觉在看。理性同样不是凭自己在看，而是通过还要内在的视觉，就是前面（<a href="1940.htm">1940</a>节）所提到的内在人的视觉在看。然而，即便这内在人也不是凭自己在看，而是主藉着这内在人在看。唯独祂在看，因为唯独祂拥有生命，并赋予人看的能力，而且是以一种在人看来他似乎凭自己在看的方式使人去看。这就是流注的情况。</p>

Thou God seest me. That this signifies influx, is evident from what has just been said. Mental view from the higher into the lower, or what is the same, from the interior into the exterior, is termed 
influx, for it takes place by influx; just as in the case of man's interior sight: unless this continually inflowed into his outer sight, which is that of the eye, this latter could not possibly apprehend 
and discern any object; for it is the interior sight which, through the eye, apprehends the things which the eye sees; and by no means is it the eye, although it so appears. From all this we may 
also see how much that man is in the fallacies of the senses who believes that the eye sees; when in fact it is the sight of his spirit, which is the interior sight, that sees through the eye.  [2] 
Spirits who were with me have seen through my eyes things in the world as well as I did (concerning which see n. 1880); yet some of them who were still in the fallacies of the senses supposed that they 
had seen through their own eyes; but they were shown that it was not so, for when my eyes were closed they saw nothing in this atmospheric world. It is the very same with man: it is his spirit that 
sees, not his eye: the spirit sees through the eye. The same thing may be seen from dreams, in which a man sometimes sees as in the day. The case is the very same in regard to this interior sight, or 
that of the spirit; this again does not see from itself, but from a still more interior sight, or that of man's rational. Nay, neither does this see of itself, but does so from a still more internal sight, 
which is that of the internal man (concerning which, n. 1940). And even this does not see of itself, for it is the Lord who sees through the internal man, and He is the Only One who sees because 
He is the Only One who lives, and He it is who gives man the ability to see, and this in such a manner that it appears to him as if he saw of himself. Such is the case with influx. </p>

You are a God who sees me' means influx. This is clear from what has just been stated. The act of seeing from what is higher into what is lower, or what amounts to the same, from interior into exterior, 
is called influx, for it takes place by means of influx. This is how it is with man's inner sight. Unless his inner sight were entering in constantly into his external sight, that of the eye, the 
eye would never be able to fix itself on and make out any object; for it is the interior sight which, through the eye, fixes itself on the things seen by the eye. It is in no way the eye that does so, 
though that seems to be the case. From these considerations it also becomes clear how much a person is swayed by the illusions of the senses who believes that the eye sees, when in fact it is the sight 
of his spirit, his interior sight, which sees by means of the eye. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 Spirits present with me have seen things in the world through my eyes as clearly as I myself have done, regarding which see <a href="1880.htm">1880</a>. Some of them however who were still swayed by the illusions of the senses supposed that they had been seeing through their own eyes. But they were shown that this was not so, for when my eyes were 
closed they saw nothing existing in this physical world. So also with man; it is not the eye which sees but his spirit by means of the eye. The same point is also evident from dreams in which one 
sometimes sees as though in the daytime. It is very similar with this interior sight, which is that of the spirit. This too does not see of itself but from a sight more interior still, which is that of 
the rational. Nor again does the rational see of itself, but there is a sight more interior still, which is that of the internal man, referred to in <a href="1940.htm">1940</a>. Yet not even this internal man sees of itself; 
it is the Lord who does so by means of the internal man. He Alone sees, since He Alone has life and enables man to see, and to seem to himself to see of himself Such is the situation with influx. </p>

`Tu Deus videns me': quod significet influxum, constat ex illis quae nunc dicta sunt: intuitio a superiore in inferiorem, se quod idem, ab interiore in exteriorem, appellatur influxus, nam fit per influxum; 
sicut visus interior apud hominem, nisi is continue influeret in visum ejus externum seu oculi, nusquam hic capere posset discernere ullum objectum, nam visus interior est qui per oculum capit 
illa quae oculus {1} videt, nusquam oculus tametsi ita apparet: ex iis quoque constare potest quantum homo in fallaciis sensuum est qui credit quod oculus videat, cum tamen est visus ejus spiritus, 
qui est visus interior, qui per oculum videt; [2] spiritus qui apud me, tam bene viderunt per oculos meos illa quae in mundo, ac ego, de quo n. 1880, at illorum quidam qui in fallaciis sensuum adhuc erant, 
putarunt {2} quod per suos oculos vidissent; sed ostensum illis quod non ita esset, clausis enim oculis, nihil in mundo hoc atmosphaerico viderunt; ita quoque se habet cum homine, ejus spiritus 
est qui videt, non oculus sed per oculum; idem etiam constare potest a somniis, in quibus quandoque homo videt sicut in die; sed usque similiter se habet cum visu hoc interiore seu spiritus, hic non videt 
ex se, sed ex adhuc interiore se rationalis ejus, immo nec hic videt a se, sed est adhuc interior qui est interni hominis, de quo n. 1940; sed usque non [est] hic, sed est Domini per internum hominem 
qui Solus videt, quia Solus vivit et dat homini ut videat, utque ei appareat sicut ex se videret: ita se habet cum influxu. 	@1 A is indistinct but might be oculo.$ 	@2 i etiam.$ </p>
