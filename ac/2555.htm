<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2555节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2555.</strong>创世记20:12，13.况且她也实在是我的妹子，她是我父亲的女儿，不是我母亲的女儿，后来作了我的妻子。当神叫我离开父家的时候，我对她说，我们无论走到什么地方，提到我，你总要说祂是我的哥哥；这就是你待我的恩情了。<br />“况且她也实在是我的妹子”表理性真理拥有这样的密切关系。“她是我父亲的女儿，不是我母亲的女儿”表理性是从作为父亲的属天良善，而非作为母亲的属灵真理孕育的。“后来作了我的妻子”表属灵真理以理性为媒介与属天之物联结起来。“当神叫我离开父家的时候”表当祂离开记忆知识和由此产生的表象，连同此处“父家”所表示的其快乐的时候。“我对她说”表当时的想法。“这就是你待我的恩情了”表那时祂会由此拥有这种安慰。“我们无论走到什么地方”表后来祂针对理性真理所推论的一切。“提到我，你总要说祂是我的哥哥”表应说理性真理已经与属天良善联结起来。</p>

Verses 12, 13. And moreover truly she is my sister, being the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother, and she became my wife. And it came to pass when God caused me to depart from my 
father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy goodness which thou shalt do unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother. "And moreover truly she is my sister," signifies 
that rational truth had such an affinity; "the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother," signifies that the rational was conceived of celestial good as a father, but not of spiritual 
truth as a mother; "and she became my wife," signifies that spiritual truth was conjoined with the celestial by the mediumship of rationality; "and it came to pass when God caused me to depart from 
my father's house," signifies when He left what is of memory-knowledge and the appearances therefrom, together with their delights, which are here the "house of his father;" "that I said unto her," 
signifies the thought at the time; "this is thy goodness which thou shalt do unto me," signifies that He would then have therefrom this comfort; "at every place whither we shall come," signifies all 
that He should afterwards conclude concerning rational truth; "say of me, he is my brother," signifies that it should be said that rational truth had been adjoined to celestial good. </p>

Verses 12, 13 And also she is truly my sister, my father's daughter but not my mother's daughter; and she became my wife. And it happened, when God caused<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> me to depart from my father's house, that I 
said to her, This is your kindness which you may do for me: at every place we come to, say for me, He is my brother. </p>
<p>'And also she is truly my sister' means that rational truth possessed such a relationship. 
'My father's daughter but not my mother's daughter' means that the rational was conceived from celestial good as the father but not from spiritual truth as the mother. 'And she became my wife' 
means that spiritual truth was joined to the celestial, with rationality serving as the means. 'And it happened, when God caused me to depart from my father's house' means when He left behind factual 
knowledge and the appearances that arise from this, together with their delights, meant here by 'father's house'. 'That I said to her' means the thought at that time. 'This is your kindness which 
you may do for me' means that consequently He would at that time have this comfort. 'At every place we come to' means all things which after that He would deduce regarding rational truth. 'Say for me, 
He is my brother' means that it should be said that rational truth had been joined to celestial good.

Vers. 12, 13.  Et etiam vere soror mea, filia patris mei illa, verumtamen non filia matris meae; et facta mihi in uxorem Et factum, quando fecerunt discedere me Deus e domo patris mei, et dixi illi, 
Haec bonitas tua, quam facias mecum, ad omnem locum quo venerimus, dic mihi, Frater meus ille. `Et etiam vere soror mea {1}' significat quod verum rationale talem affinitatem haberet: `filia patris mei 
illa, verumtamen non filia matris meae' significat quod rationale conceptum sit ex bono caelesti ut a patre, non autem ex spirituali vero ut a matre: `et facta mihi in uxorem' significat quod verum 
spirituale conjunctum sit caelesti media rationalitate: `et factum quando fecerunt discedere me Deus e domo patris mei' significat cum relinqueret scientificum et apparentias inde, cum jucundis eorum, 
quae hic sunt `domus patris sui': `et dixi illi' significat cogitationem tunc: `haec bonitas tua quam facias mecum' significat quod inde tunc haberet hoc solatium: `ad omnem locum quo venerimus' significat 
omnia quae concluderet postea de vero rationali: `dic mihi, Frater meus ille' significat quod diceretur quod rationale verum adjunctum esset caelesti bono. 	@1 i est I.$ </p>
