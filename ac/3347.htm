<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3347节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3347.</strong>我曾经听天使们谈论人类心智，及其思维和从中所流出的言语。他们将其比作人的外在形式，外在形式通过内部无数形式存在并持续存在，如脑、髓质、肺、心、肝、胰、脾、胃、肠和许多其它器官；还有两性的生殖器官，以及包围这些器官的无数肌肉，最后是外面的覆盖物。所有这些反过来由血管和纤维，事实上由血管和纤维里面的血管和纤维交织构成，管道和较小的形式就源于这些血管和纤维。因此，人体，就是人的外在形式由无数事物组成；然而，所有这些事物都以各自方式致力于构成外在形式，而内部事物丝毫没有显现在这外在形式中。<br />他们将人类心智，及其思维和从中所流出的言语比作这种外在形式。但他们将天使的心智比作那些内部事物，与构成人类心智的事物相比，这些事物是无限的，也是无法理解的。他们还将思维的官能比作照着纤维所取形式发挥作用的器官所具有的官能，声称这种官能并不属于纤维，而属于纤维里面的生命；就像思维的官能并不属于头脑，而属于从主流入头脑中的生命那样。天使在打比方的同时，还通过代表将这些比方展现出来；而上述内在形式，就连无法理解的最细小的部分都通过代表被呈现出来，既可见，又可理解，并且这一过程就在一瞬间。不过，通过属灵和属天之物来打的比方，就是诸如属天天使所打的那类比方，在智慧的优美方面，要远远胜过通过属世之物所打的那些比方。</p>

I have heard angels speaking concerning human minds, and concerning their thought and the derivative speech. They compared them to the external form of man, which comes forth and subsists from the innumerable 
forms that are within-as from the brains, the medulla, the lungs, the heart, liver, pancreas, spleen, stomach, and intestines, besides many other organs, as those of generation in both sexes 
from the innumerable muscles encompassing these organs; and lastly from the integuments; and from all these being woven together from vessels and fibers, and indeed from vessels and fibers within vessels 
and fibers, from which come the ducts and lesser forms; thus that the body is composed of things innumerable; all of which nevertheless conspire, each in its own way, to the composition of the external 
form, in which nothing appears of the things that are within. To this external form they compared human minds, and their thoughts and the derivative speech. But angelic minds they compared to those 
things which are within, which are relatively illimitable, and also incomprehensible. They also compared the faculty of thinking to the faculty that belongs to the viscera of acting according to 
the form of the fibers, saying that the faculty is not of the fibers, but of the life in the fibers; just as the faculty of thinking is not of the mind, but of life from the Lord flowing into it. When 
such comparisons are made by angels they are at the same time exhibited by means of representatives, whereby the interior forms above spoken of are presented visibly and intellectually, in respect to 
their smallest incomprehensible parts, and this in a moment; but comparisons made by means of spiritual and celestial things, such as take place among the celestial angels, immeasurably surpass in the 
beauty of wisdom those made by means of natural things. </p>

I have heard angels talking about human minds, and about their thought and the speech that flows from it. They compared them to a person's external form which nevertheless derives its being and is kept 
in being from countless forms that are within, such as the brains, medullary areas, lungs, heart, liver, pancreas, spleen, stomach, and intestines, in addition to many others, such as those devoted 
in both sexes to begetting offspring; and around these countless muscles, and at last the outer coverings. All of these in turn are composed of vessels and fibres, and indeed of vessels and fibres within 
vessels and fibres, from which ducts and smaller forms are derived. Thus a person's external form is derived from countless parts, all of which nevertheless contribute, each in its own way, to the 
composition of the external form in which nothing of the things that are within shows itself. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 It was to this form - the external form - that the angels were comparing human minds, and their thoughts 
and speech flowing from these. But angelic minds they compared to the things that are within, which in comparison with those that make up the human mind are unlimited and also beyond comprehension. 
They also compared the ability to think to the ability which organs have to act according to the form which the fibres take. They said that this ability belonged not to the fibres but to the life 
within the fibres, just as the ability to think does not belong to the mind but to the life from the Lord that is flowing into it When they are being made by angels such comparisons also at the same 
time manifest themselves in representatives, by means of which the interior forms referred to are presented both visually and mentally, and within an instant, even as to the smallest incomprehensible 
parts. But the comparisons which are made by means of spiritual and celestial things, such as those made among celestial angels, are immensely superior in the beauty of wisdom to those comparisons which 
are made by means of natural things. </p>

Audivi angelos loquentes de mentibus humanis et illarum cogitatione et inde loquela; comparabant illas externae hominis formae, quae usque existit et subsistit ex formis innumeris quae intus sunt, ut 
ex cerebris, medullis, pulmonibus, corde, hepate, pancreate, liene, ventriculo et intestinis, praeter a pluribus aliis, ut ab illis quae generationi in utroque sexu dicatae sunt; et circum illa ex musculis 
innumeris, et tandem ex tegumentis; et quod haec omnia contexta sint ex vasis et fibris, et quidem ex vasis et fibris intra vasa et fibras, ex quibus ductus et formae minores; ita ex innumerabilibus, 
quae omnia usque concurrunt, quodlibet suo modo, ad compositionem formae externae, in qua nihil eorum quae intra sunt, apparet; [2] huic formae, nempe externae, comparabant mentes humanas, et 
earum cogitationes, ac inde loquelas; at angelicas comparabant illis quae intus sunt, quae respective indefinita sunt et quoque incomprehensibilia; facultatem etiam cogitandi comparabant facultati viscerum 
agendi secundum formam fibrarum, dicentes quod facultas non esset fibrarum, sed vitae in fibris, sicut facultas cogitandi non {1}est mentis, sed vitae a Domino influentis in illam. Comparationes 
tales cum fiunt ab angelis, simul etiam {2}exhibentur per repraesentativa, per quae formae interiores de quibus dictum, quoad minima incomprehensibilia sistuntur et {3}visibiliter et intellectualiter, 
et hoc intra momentum: sed comparationes per spiritualia et caelestia, quales {4}fiunt apud angelos caelestes, illas comparationes quae per naturalia fiunt, pulchritudine sapientiae immensum excedunt. @1
