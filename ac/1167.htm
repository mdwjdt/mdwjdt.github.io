<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1167节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1167.</strong>在圣言中，“迦南”或迦南人表仪式，或脱离内在的外在敬拜。这从大量经文，尤其圣言的历史部分清楚看出来。由于那时迦南人具有这种秉性，所以当雅各的子孙被引入他们的陆地时，就允许他们被灭绝。但在圣言的内义上，迦南人用来表具有脱离内在的外在敬拜的所有人。由于犹太人和以色列比谁都具有这种秉性，故在圣言的预言部分，“迦南人”特指他们，这仅从以下两节经文就能看出来，诗篇：<br />流无辜人的血，就是自己儿女的血，把他们祭祀迦南的偶像；那地就被血污秽了。这样，他们被自己所做的污秽了，在行为上犯了邪淫。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗106.38.htm">106:38</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗106.39.htm">39</a>）<br />此处，“流儿女的血”在内义上表他们摧毁一切信之真和仁之善。“把儿女祭祀迦南的偶像”表用脱离内在的外在敬拜亵渎信与仁之物，这样的敬拜无非是偶像崇拜。所以，“他们被自己所做的污秽了，在行为上犯了邪淫”。以西结书：<br />说，主耶和华对耶路撒冷如此说：你的根源，你的出生是从迦南陆地而来。你父亲是亚摩利人，你母亲是赫人。<br />此处经上明确说明，他们属于迦南陆地。至于“迦南”表脱离内在的外在敬拜，可参看前文（<a href="1078.htm">1078</a>，<a href="1094.htm">1094</a>节）。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1167.</strong> Canaan (or a Canaanite) in the Word symbolizes ritual or outward forms of worship separated from inward, as many passages illustrate, especially in the narrative books. Because Canaanites practiced this kind of worship at the period when the children of Jacob invaded their land, their obliteration was permitted; but in the Word's inner meaning, Canaanites mean everyone who practices outward worship separated from inward. Since Jews and Israelites engaged in this kind of worship more than anyone else, Canaan refers specifically to them in the prophetic parts of the Word, as the two following passages alone show. In David:<br />They have shed innocent blood — the blood of their sons and daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan — and the land has been profaned with blood. And they have been polluted by their works and have prostituted themselves in their deeds. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1167/bible_king-james-version_psalms_106_38-39" target=_top>Psalms 106:38-39</a>)<br />[2] In a deeper sense, shedding the blood of their sons and daughters means that they blotted out all religious truth and all the good effects of neighborly love. Sacrificing their sons and daughters to the idols of Canaan symbolizes profaning the attributes of faith and charity through outward worship detached from inward, which is the same as idolatry. In this way they polluted themselves with their works and prostituted themselves in their deeds. In Ezekiel:<br />This is what the Lord Jehovih has said to Jerusalem: "Your trading and your birth origins belong to the land of Canaan. Your father is an Amorite and your mother a Hittite." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1167/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_16_3" target=_top>Ezekiel 16:3</a>)<br />This says explicitly that they came from the Canaanite land.<br />For the symbolism of Canaan as external worship detached from internal, see what appears above in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1167/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1078" target=_top>1078</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1167/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1094" target=_top>1094</a>. </p>

That by "Canaan," or "the Canaanite," when mentioned in the Word, are signified rituals, that is, the things of external worship separated from internal, is evident from very many passages, especially 
in the historicals. Because the Canaanites were of this character at the time when the sons of Jacob were introduced into their land, it was permitted that they should be exterminated. But in the internal 
sense of the Word, all those are meant by "Canaanites" who have external worship separated from internal. And as the Jews and Israelites more than others were of this nature, they specifically 
are signified by "Canaanites" in the prophetical Word, as may be seen from these two passages only: </p>
<p>     They have shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they 
sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan; and the land was profaned with bloods, and they were defiled with their works, and went a whoring in their doings. (Ps. 106:38-39). "To shed the blood of sons and 
daughters," here signifies in the internal sense that they extinguished all truths of faith and goods of charity; "to sacrifice sons and daughters to the idols of Canaan" signifies to profane the things 
which are of faith and charity by external worship separate from internal, which is nothing else than idolatrous. Thus were they defiled with their works, and went a whoring in their doings. In Ezekiel: </p>
<p> 
    Thus saith the Lord Jehovih unto Jerusalem, Thy tradings and thy nativity is of the land of Canaan; thy father was an Amorite, and thy mother a Hittite (Ezek. 16:3). Here they are plainly 
said to be of the land of Canaan. (That "Canaan" signifies external worship separated from internal may be seen above, n. 1078, 1094.) </p>

In the Word 'Canaan' or the Canaanite means forms of ritual or external worship separated from internal. This is clear from very many places, especially in historical sections. This being the character 
of the Canaanites at the time that the sons of Jacob were brought into the land, permission was given to wipe them out. But in the internal sense of the Word Canaanites are used to mean all people 
whose worship is external separated from internal. And because this was pre-eminently true of the Jews and Israelites, they specifically are meant in the prophetic Word, as becomes clear from the following 
two places alone: In David, </p>
<blockquote>
They poured out innocent blood, the blood of their sons and daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan; and the land was profaned with blood.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> They became 
unclean by their acts, and committed whoredom in their doings. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20106:38,%2039&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 106:38, 39</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'pouring out the blood of sons and daughters' means in the internal sense that they destroyed every truth of 
faith and good of charity. 'Sacrificing sons and daughters to the idols of Canaan' means profaning matters of faith and charity by means of external worship separated from internal, which is nothing else 
than idolatrous worship. So 'they became unclean by their acts and committed whoredom in their doings'. In Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
Thus said the Lord Jehovih to Jerusalem, Your tracings and your nativity are 
of the land of Canaan. Your father was an Amorite and your mother a Hittite. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2016:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 16:3</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here it is stated explicitly that they belonged to the land of Canaan. As regards 'Canaan' meaning external 
worship separated from internal, see what has appeared already in <a href="1078.htm">1078</a>,<a href="1094.htm">1094</a>.

Quod per 'Canaanem seu Canaanitam' significentur in Verbo ritualia, seu externi cultus separati ab interno, ex permultis locis constat, cumprimis in historicis, qui quia tales erant tempore cum filii 
Jacobi intromissi in terram, permissum fuit ut exstirparentur; sed in sensu interno Verbi omnes illi per Canaanitas intelliguntur qui externum cultum separatum ab interno habent; et quia prae ceteris 
Judaei et Israelitae tales fuerunt, in Verbo prophetico ii in specie significantur, ut solum ex his binis locis constare potest, apud Davidem, Fuderunt sanguinem innocentem, sanguinem filiorum et filiarum 
suarum, quos sacrificabant idolis Canaanis; et profanata est terra sanguinibus; et immundi facti operibus suis, scortatique sunt factis suis, Ps. cvi 38, 39; ibi 'fundere sanguinem filiorum et 
filiarum' in sensu interno est quod exstinxerint omnia vera fidei et bona charitatis; 'filios et filias sacrificare idolis Canaanis' significat illa quae sunt fidei et charitatis profanare per cultum 
externum separatum ab interno, qui non nisi quam idololatricus est, ita 'immundi facti operibus suis et scortati factis suis':  apud Ezechielem, Sic dixit Dominus Jehovih Hierosolymae, Negotiationes 
tuae, et natales tui de terra Canaane; pater tuus Emoraeus, et mater tua Hittaea, xvi 3; </p>
<p>ubi aperte dicuntur a terra Canaanaea.  Quod 'Canaan' significet cultum externum separatum ab interno, videantur 
quae prius n. 1078, 1094. </p>
