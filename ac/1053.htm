<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1053节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1053.</strong>“彩虹必现在云彩中”表那人的状态。这一点从前面有关云中彩虹的阐述和说明清楚可知。也就是说，在来生，一个人或灵魂从他的气场就能在众天使当中被得知，并且只要主乐意，该气场还能通过如彩虹那样的颜色呈现出来，且照各人在信主、因而信之善与真方面的状态而各异。在来生，颜色显为可见，并因其明亮和灿烂而远比世上所看到的颜色美丽得多。每种颜色都代表某种属天或属灵之物。<br />这些颜色既源于天堂之光，也源于属灵之光的杂色，如前所述。事实上，天使所在之光如此明亮，以致尘世之光根本无法与之相比。拿天使所在的天堂之光与尘世之光对比，如同拿正午太阳之光与太阳升起时即将熄灭、不再发光的蜡烛之光对比。天堂有属天之光和属灵之光。相对而言，天堂之光就象日光，而属灵之光则象月光，不过，一切差异皆取决于接受这光的天使的状态。颜色也一样，因为它们是光的产物。在属天天使的天堂，主自己就是一轮太阳，而在属灵天使的天堂，主自己则是一轮月亮。在那些对死后灵魂所过的生活没有任何概念的人看来，这些事难以置信，尽管它们是最真实的。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1053.</strong> The symbolism of and there will be a bow in the cloud as the stage at which they are, is established by explanations and demonstrations above concerning the bow in the cloud. It was noted that people or souls in the next world are recognized by angels from their aura; that when the Lord pleases, an aura also presents itself as a display of rainbow colors; and that variation in these colors depends on an individual's stage of development in regard to faith in the Lord, and so in regard to the good impulses and true ideas of faith [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1053/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1042" target=_top>1042:1</a>-<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1053/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1043#subsection-2-2" target=_top>1043:2</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1053/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1048" target=_top>1048</a>].<br />In the other life, colors appear whose glow and brilliance makes them far more beautiful than the colors visible to earthly eyes. Each color represents some heavenly, spiritual trait. The colors issue from the light that exists in heaven and from the variegation of spiritual light, as noted above [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1053/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1042" target=_top>1042</a>].<br />[2] Angels, you see, live in such abundant light that the light of the world, by comparison, is useless. Heaven's light, in which angels live, is to worldly light as noonday sunlight is to candlelight, which fades to nothing when the sun rises.<br />In heaven there is a heavenly type of light and a spiritual type. Heavenly light, if I may speak in relative terms, is like sunlight, while spiritual light is like moonlight, but with all possible gradations, depending on conditions in the angel who receives the light. The same is true of colors, since they are a product of that light.<br />In the heaven of angels whose character is heavenly, the Lord himself is the sun, while in the heaven of spiritual angels, he is the moon.<br />One who has no concept of the life a soul lives after death will find these facts unbelievable, but they are still positively true. </p>

And the bow shall be in the cloud. That this signifies man's state, is evident from what has been said and shown above concerning the bow in the cloud, namely, that a man or a soul in the other life 
is known among angels from his sphere, and that this sphere, whenever it pleases the Lord, is represented by colors, like those of the rainbow, in variety according to the state of each person relatively 
to faith in the Lord, thus relatively to the goods and truths of faith. In the other life colors are presented to view which from their brightness and resplendence immeasurably surpass the beauty 
of the colors seen on earth; and each color represents something celestial and spiritual. These colors are from the light of heaven, and from the variegation of spiritual light, as said above. For angels 
live in light so great that the light of the world is nothing in comparison. The light of heaven in which angels live, in comparison with the light of the world, is as the noonday light of the sun 
in comparison with candlelight, which is extinguished and becomes a nullity on the rising of the sun. In heaven there are both celestial light and spiritual light. Celestial light-to speak comparatively-is 
like the light of the sun, and spiritual light is like the light of the moon, but with every difference according to the state of the angel who receives the light. It is the same with the colors, 
because they are from the light. The Lord Himself is to the heaven of the celestial angels a Sun, and to the heaven of the spiritual angels, a Moon. These things will not be credited by those who have 
no conception of the life which souls live after death, and yet they are most true. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1053</b></p><p><b>1053.</b>
That 'and the bow will be in the cloud' means the state of that man is clear from what has been stated and shown already about the bow in the cloud, that is to say, in the next life a person or soul 
is known among angels from his sphere; and as often as it pleases the Lord that sphere is  represented by means of colours like those of the rainbow, variously according to each person's state as to 
faith in the Lord and thus respectively as to goods and truths of faith. In the next life colours present themselves to view, which on account of their brilliance and splendour are immensely superior 
in beauty to colours seen with the eyes on earth. Each colour represents something celestial or spiritual. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Those colours derive from the light in heaven, and from the variegation of spiritual light, 
as stated above. Indeed angels live in light so bright that the light of the world is in comparison no light at all. The light of heaven in which angels live, compared with the light of the world, 
is as the light of the sun at midday to the light of a candle that is put out and ceases to give any light at all when the sun rises. In heaven there is celestial light and there is spiritual light. 
Let me compare the two by saying that celestial light is as the light of the sun, while spiritual light is as the light of the moon. But all manner of variation exists depending on the state of the 
angel receiving the light. The same applies to colours since they are a product of the light. In the heaven of celestial angels the Lord Himself is the Sun, and in the heaven of spiritual angels the Moon. 
To people who have no conception of the life which souls lead after death these matters are unbelievable. They are nevertheless completely true.  </p>

</p><b>1053.</b>
'Et erit arcus in nube': quod significet statum ejus, constat ex illis quae prius de arcu in nube dicta et ostensa sunt, quod nempe homo aut anima in altera vita cognoscatur ex sphaera ejus apud angelos; 
et quod sphaera quoties Domino beneplacet, repraesentetur per colores quales sunt arcus, diversimode secundum cujusvis statum, respective ad fidem in Dominum, ita respective ad bona et vera fidei: 
in altera vita sistuntur videndi colores qui ex nitore et splendore immensum superant pulchritudinem colorum qui oculis in terra videntur; unusquisque color aliquid caeleste et spirituale repraesentat; 
[2] colores illi sunt ex luce quae in caelo, et variegatione lucis spiritualis, ut dictum supra; vivunt enim angeli in tanta luce ut lux mundi respective nihili sit; lux caeli in qua vivunt angeli, 
ad lucem mundi se habet respective sicut lumen solis meridiani ad lumen candelae, quod exstinguitur et nullum fit oriente sole: est in caelo lux caelestis et est lux spiritualis; lux caelestis, ut 
comparative loquar, est sicut lux solis, at lux spiritualis est sicut lux lunae, sed cum omni differentia secundum statum angeli recipientis lucem; similiter se habent colores quia ex luce inde.  Ipse 
Dominus est caelo angelorum caelestium Sol, et caelo angelorum spiritualium Luna: haec incredibilia sunt iis qui nullum conceptum de vita quam animae vivunt post mortem, habent, sed usque verissima. </p>
