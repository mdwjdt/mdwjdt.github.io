<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7370节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7370.</strong>人若与自己相比看不起邻舍，如果邻舍不偏向并遵从他，就视之为仇敌，就沉浸于自我之爱；若因此仇恨并迫害他的邻舍，就深深沉浸于自我之爱；若因此对他燃起报复之心，渴望毁灭他，更是深深沉浸于自我之爱。像这样的人最终喜欢将怒气发泄在他们的邻舍身上；他们若还是奸淫者，就会变得残忍。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 7370</b></p><p><b>7370.</b>
That man is in the love of self who despises his neighbor in comparison with himself, who regards him as his enemy if he does not favor and reverence him; he is still more in the love of self who therefore 
hates and persecutes his neighbor; and he still more who therefore burns with revenge against him and desires his destruction. Such persons at last love to rage against their neighbor; and the 
same, if they are also adulterers, become cruel. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7370</b></p><p><b>7370.</b>
The person immersed in self-love is one who despises his neighbour in comparison with himself, and who regards his neighbour as an enemy if he is not favourably disposed towards him and does not defer 
to him. Immersed more deeply in self-love is one who therefore hates and persecutes his neighbour; and immersed even more deeply than that is one who is therefore consumed with vengeance against him 
and longs to ruin him. People like this at length love to vent their rage on their neighbour; and if these people are also adulterers they become cruel. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 7370</b>
</p><b>7370.</b>
Ille homo in amore sui est qui proximum contemnit prae se, qui inimicum illum habet si non sibi favet et si non se colit; magis adhuc in amore sui est qui propterea proximum odio habet et persequitur; 
et magis adhuc qui propterea flagrat vindicta contra illum et cupit ejus perniciem; tales tandem amant saevire contra proximum; et iidem si quoque adulteri sunt, crudeles fiunt. </p>
