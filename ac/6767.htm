<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6767节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6767.</strong>“难道你要杀我”表难道你想毁灭我的信？这从“杀”和“希伯来人”的含义清楚可知：“杀”是指毁灭，如下文所述；“希伯来人”，即此处的“我”，是指属教会的人，相应地也指信，因为信与教会是不可分割的，这二者彼此相连，以致一个毁灭存在于某人那里的信之人就是毁灭他那里的教会。这也是“杀他”，因为凡夺走信的人，也夺走了属灵生命，而留下来的生命是被称为“死亡”的生命。由此明显可知，“难道你要杀我”表难道你想毁灭我的信？<br />“杀”是指夺走属灵生命，这一点从圣言中的许多经文清楚看出来，如耶利米书：<br />求你将他们拉出来，如同屠宰的羊，叫他们等候杀戮的日子。这地悲哀，田野的植物都枯干，要到几时呢？因其上居民的恶行，牲畜和飞鸟都灭绝了。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶12.3.htm">12:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶12.4.htm">4</a>）<br />“杀戮的日子”表示教会荒废的时候，这时不再有任何信，因为没有仁爱。“悲哀的地”表示教会；“田野的草木”表示含有真理在里面的一切真正的记忆知识；“牲畜和飞鸟都灭绝了”表示良善与真理都要被毁灭。因为“地”是指教会（参看<a href="566.htm">566</a>，<a href="662.htm">662</a>，<a href="1067.htm">1067</a>，<a href="1262.htm">1262</a>，<a href="1413.htm">1413</a>，<a href="1607.htm">1607</a>，<a href="1733.htm">1733</a>，<a href="1850.htm">1850</a>，<a href="2117.htm">2117</a>，<a href="2118.htm">2118</a>e，<a href="2928.htm">2928</a>，<a href="3355.htm">3355</a>，<a href="4335.htm">4335</a>，<a href="4447.htm">4447</a>，<a href="5577.htm">5577</a>节）；“植物”（herb或plant，经上或译青草、草木等）是指真正的记忆知识，这从圣言中提及“植物”的地方清楚看出来。“田野”是指属教会的东西（参看<a href="2971.htm">2971</a>，<a href="3310.htm">3310</a>，<a href="3766.htm">3766</a>节）；“牲畜”是指对良善的情感，因而是指良善（<a href="45.htm">45</a>，<a href="46.htm">46</a>，<a href="142.htm">142</a>，<a href="143.htm">143</a>，<a href="246.htm">246</a>，<a href="714.htm">714</a>，<a href="715.htm">715</a>，<a href="719.htm">719</a>，<a href="1823.htm">1823</a>，<a href="2179.htm">2179</a>，<a href="2180.htm">2180</a>，<a href="3218.htm">3218</a>，<a href="3519.htm">3519</a>，<a href="5198.htm">5198</a>节）；“飞鸟”是指对真理的情感（<a href="5149.htm">5149</a>节）。由此可见上述这些话是什么意思，还可以看出每一个细节里面都有一个灵义。谁都能看出，若没有内义，“杀戮的日子”、“悲哀的地”、“因其上居民的恶行而都枯干的田野的植物”、“牲畜和飞鸟都灭绝了”是什么意思就无法理解了。<br />撒迦利亚书：<br />耶和华我的神如此说，要牧养这将宰的羊，它们的主人要杀它们。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚11.4.htm">11:4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚11.5.htm">5</a>）<br />“将宰的羊”明显表示那些信仰被他们主人毁灭的人。以西结书：<br />你们为两把大麦，为几块饼，在我民中亵渎我，杀死不该死的灵魂，救活不该活的灵魂。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结13.19.htm">13:19</a>）<br />此处“杀死”明显表示毁灭属灵生命，也就是信与仁。以赛亚书：<br />到降罚和荒凉的日子，你们怎样行呢？他们只得屈身在被掳的人以下，仆倒在被杀的人以下。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛10.3.htm">10:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛10.4.htm">4</a>）<br />此处“被杀的”表示那些陷入地狱的人，因而表示那些沉浸于邪恶和虚假的人。<br /><br />惟独你被抛弃在你的坟墓之外，好像可憎的枝子，以被杀的人为衣，就是被剑刺透的。你不得在坟墓里与他们联合，因为你败坏你的地，杀戮你的民。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛14.19.htm">14:19</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛14.20.htm">20</a>）<br />“被杀的人”表示那些被剥夺属灵生命的人；“杀戮你的民”表示他已毁灭信之真理与良善。约翰福音：<br />盗贼来，无非要偷窃、杀害、毁坏；我来了，是要叫他们得生命。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.10.htm">10:10</a>）<br />“杀害”表示毁灭信之生命，故经上说“我来了，是要叫他们得生命”。马可福音：<br />弟兄要把弟兄，父亲要把孩子，送到死地；儿女要起来与父母为敌，杀害他们。（马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可13.12.htm">13:12</a>）<br />这论及教会的末日，这时不再有任何仁，因而不再有任何信；“弟兄”、“孩子”和“父母”在内义上是指教会的良善与真理；“杀害”是指毁灭它们。<br />由于“杀人的人”表示剥夺属灵生命的人，“田”表示教会，故在代表性教会有这样一条律例：<br />无论何人在田野地面上摸了被剑刺死的，或是被杀的，就要七天不洁净。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民19.16.htm">19:16</a>）<br />“被剑刺死的”是指被虚假灭绝的真理（参看<a href="4503.htm">4503</a>节），因为“剑”是指灭绝真理的虚假（<a href="2799.htm">2799</a>，<a href="4499.htm">4499</a>，<a href="6353.htm">6353</a>节）。这条律例也一样：<br />在你为业的地上，若遇见被杀的人倒在田野，不知道是谁杀了他，长老和审判官就要量四围的城邑。遇见最近的城，他们就要取一头母牛犊，把它牵到流水等。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申21.1.htm">21:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申21.10.htm">10</a>）</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6767</b></p><p><b>6767.</b>
Sayest thou to kill me? That this signifies "wouldest thou destroy my faith?" is evident from the signification of "killing," as being to destroy (of which below); and from the signification of a "Hebrew 
man," here meant by "me," as being one who is of the church, thus also faith, for faith is of the church, and these two things are so united that he who destroys faith with anyone, destroys the church 
with him. This also is "killing" him, for he who takes away faith, takes away spiritual life, the life which remains being that which is called "death." Hence it is evident that by, "Sayest thou 
to kill me?" is signified "wouldest thou destroy my faith?" [2] That "to kill" denotes to take away spiritual life, is clear from many passages in the Word, as in Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Drag them away as a 
sheep for the slaughter, and devote them for the day of killing. How long shall the land mourn and the herb of every field wither, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein? The beasts and the bird 
will be consumed (Jer. 12:3-4); </p>
<p>"the day of killing" denotes the time of the vastation of the church, when there is no longer any faith, because no charity; "the land which shall mourn" denotes the 
church; "the herb of every field" denotes every true memory-knowledge of the church; "the beasts and the bird will be consumed" denotes that goods and truths will be so. (That the "land" is the church, 
see n. 566, 662, 1067, 1262, 1413, 1607, 1733, 1850, 2117, 2118, 2928, 3355, 4335, 4447, 5577; that "herb" is true memory-knowledge is evident from the passages in the Word where "herb" is mentioned; 
that "field" is that which is of the church, n. 2971, 3310, 3766; that "beasts" are affections of good, thus goods, n. 45, 46, 142, 143, 246, 714, 715, 719, 1823, 2179, 2180, 3218, 3519, 5198; and 
"birds" affections of truth, n. 5149.) Hence it can be seen what is the meaning of the above words, and also that there is a spiritual sense in every detail. Everyone can see that without an interior 
sense it could not be understood what is meant by "a day of killing," by "the earth mourning," by "every herb of the field withering for the wickedness of those who dwell therein," and by "the beasts 
and the bird being consumed." [3] In Zechariah: </p>
<p>     Thus said Jehovah my God, Feed the sheep of killing, which their possessors kill (Zech. 11:4-5); </p>
<p>where "the sheep of killing" plainly denotes those 
whose faith the possessors destroy. In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Thou hast profaned Me with My people, for handfuls of barley, and for pieces of bread, to kill the souls which ought not to die, and to keep 
the souls alive which ought not to live (Ezek. 13:19); </p>
<p>here also "to kill" plainly denotes to destroy spiritual life, that is, faith and charity. In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     What will ye do in the day of visitation 
and of vastation? Beneath the bound, and beneath the killed shall they fall (Isa. 10:3-4); </p>
<p>where the "killed" denote those who are in hell, thus who are in evils and falsities. [4] Again: </p>
<p>    
 Thou art cast out of thy sepulchre like an abominable shoot, the raiment of the killed, of one pierced with the sword. Thou shalt not be united with them in the grave, because thou hast destroyed thy 
land, thou hast killed thy people (Isa. 14:19-20); </p>
<p>"the killed" denote those who are deprived of spiritual life; "thou hast killed thy people" denotes that he has destroyed the truths and goods of faith. 
In John: </p>
<p>     The thief cometh not but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they may have life (John 10:10); </p>
<p>"to kill" denotes to destroy the life of faith, and therefore 
it is said, "I am come that they may have life." In Mark: </p>
<p>     The brother shall deliver the brother to death, and the father the children, and children shall rise up against their parents and shall 
kill them (Mark 13:12); </p>
<p>speaking of the last times of the church, when there is no longer any charity, and therefore not any faith; "brother," "children," and "parents," in the internal sense, are the 
goods and truths of the church, and "to kill" is to destroy them. [5] As by "one killed" was signified one deprived of spiritual life, and by "field" the church, therefore it was a statute in the representative 
church, that      If anyone touched on the surface of a field anyone pierced with a sword, or killed, he should be unclean seven days (Num. 19:16); </p>
<p>that "one pierced with a sword" is truth 
extinguished by falsity, see above, n. 4503, for "sword" denotes falsity which extinguishes truth, n. 2799, 4499, 6353.      In like manner this was a statute: If anyone was found killed in the 
land of inheritance, upon a field, and it should not be known who had killed him, the elders and judges were to measure between the cities round about, and having thus found the nearest city, they were 
to take a calf and were to head it by a running stream; besides other particulars (Deut. 21:1-10). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6767</b></p><p><b>6767.</b>
'Do you intend to kill me . . .' means, Do you wish to destroy my faith ... This is clear from the meaning of 'killing' as destroying, dealt with below; and from the meaning of a Hebrew man, to whom 
'me' refers here, as one who belongs to the Church. Faith too is accordingly meant, for faith goes together with the Church, and the two are so bound up with each other that a person who destroys the 
faith present with someone destroys the Church with him. This is also 'to kill him', for by taking faith away he takes spiritual life away, the life that remains being a life that is called death. From 
this it is evident that 'Do you intend to kill me?' means, Do you wish to destroy my faith?  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The fact that 'killing' is taking away spiritual life is evident from many places in the Word, as 
in Jeremiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
Drag them away like sheep for the slaughter, and destine them to the day of killing. How long will the land mourn and the plant of every field wither, on account of the wickedness of 
those who dwell in it? The beasts and the birds will be devoured. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2012:3,%204&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 12:3, 4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The day of killing' stands for the time that the Church is laid waste, when there is no longer any faith because there 
is no charity. 'The land which will mourn' stands for the Church; 'the plant of every field' stands for all the facts known to the Church that hold truth within them; 'the beasts and the birds will 
be devoured' stands for the fact that forms of good and truths will be destroyed. For the meaning of 'the land' as the Church, see <a href="566.htm">566</a>, <a href="662.htm">662</a>, <a href="1067.htm">1067</a>, <a href="1262.htm">1262</a>, <a href="1413.htm">1413</a>, <a href="1607.htm">1607</a>, <a href="1733.htm">1733</a>, <a href="1850.htm">1850</a>, <a href="2117.htm">2117</a>, <a href="2118.htm">2118</a> (end), <a href="2928.htm">2928</a>, <a href="3755.htm">3755</a>, <a href="4447.htm">4447</a>, <a href="4535.htm">4535</a>, <a href="5577.htm">5577</a>. The meaning of 'the plant' as factual knowledge holding truth within it is clear from places in the Word where plant is mentioned. And for the meaning of 'the field' as that 
which is of the Church, see <a href="2971.htm">2971</a>, <a href="3710.htm">3710</a>, <a href="3766.htm">3766</a>, of 'the beasts' as affections for good, thus forms of good, <a href="45.htm">45</a>, <a href="46.htm">46</a>, <a href="142.htm">142</a>, <a href="143.htm">143</a>, <a href="246.htm">246</a>, <a href="714.htm">714</a>, <a href="715.htm">715</a>, <a href="719.htm">719</a>, <a href="1823.htm">1823</a>, <a href="2179.htm">2179</a>, <a href="2180.htm">2180</a>, <a href="3218.htm">3218</a>, <a href="3519.htm">3519</a>, <a href="5198.htm">5198</a>, and of 'the birds' as 
affections for truth, <a href="5149.htm">5149</a>. From all this one may recognize what the meaning of these words is, and also that the spiritual sense is present in every detail there. Anyone can see that without the inner 
meaning there could be no understanding of what 'the day of killing' is, or of what is described by the details 'will the land mourn', 'the plant of every field wither, on account of the wickedness 
of those who dwell in it', and 'the beasts and the birds will be devoured'.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In Zechariah, </p>
<blockquote>
Thus said Jehovah my God, Feed the sheep for killing, whose owners kill them. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Zech%2011:4,%205&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Zech 11:4, 5</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The 
sheep for killing' plainly stands for people whose faith is destroyed by those who are their owners. In Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
You have desecrated Me among My people for handfuls of barley and for crusts of 
bread, to kill souls that ought not to die, and to keep alive souls that ought not to live. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2013:19&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 13:19</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here also 'killing' plainly stands for destroying spiritual life, that is, charity and faith. 
In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
What will you do on the day of visitation and vastation? They will fall beneath the bound and beneath the killed. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2010:3,%204&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 10:3, 4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'the killed' stands for those who are in hell, thus 
for those immersed in evils and falsities. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
You are cast out from your sepulchre like an abominable branch, [like] a garment of the killed, [like] those pierced with 
the sword. You will not be united with them in the sepulchre, for you have destroyed your land, you have killed your people. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2014:19,%2020&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 14:19, 20</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The killed' stands for those who have been deprived of 
spiritual life; you have killed your people' stands for his destruction of forms of the truth and good of faith. In John, </p>
<blockquote>
The thief does not come except in order to steal, kill, and destroy. I have 
come in order that they may have life. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2010:10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 10:10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Killing' stands for destroying the life of faith, and therefore it says, 'I have come in order that they may have life'. In Mark,  </p>
<blockquote>
Brother will 
deliver up brother to death, and the father his children, and the children will rise up against parents and kill them. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%2013:12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 13:12</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the last days of the Church when there is no longer 
any charity and therefore no faith either. 'Brother', 'children', and 'parents' in the internal sense are the Church's forms of good and its truths; and 'killing' is destroying them. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 Because 
one who had been 'killed' meant a person who had been deprived of spiritual life, and 'the field' meant the Church, it had therefore been decreed in the representative church that if anyone on the surface 
of the field touched somebody who had been pierced with the sword, or who had been killed, he would be unclean for seven days, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2019:16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 19:16</a>. 'Slain with the sword' means truth wiped out by falsity, 
see <a href="4507.htm">4507</a>; for 'the sword' is falsity that wipes out truth, <a href="2799.htm">2799</a>, <a href="4499.htm">4499</a>, <a href="653.htm">653</a>. It was likewise decreed that if anyone was found killed in the land which was their inheritance, lying on the field, and 
it was not known who had killed him, the elders and judges were to measure the distances to the cities which were round about. Having found out by doing this which was the nearest city, they were to take 
a heifer and break its neck at a fast-flowing river, and to do many other things, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2021:1-10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 21:1-10</a>. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 6767</b>
</p><b>6767.</b>
`Num ad occidendum me tu dicis?': quod significet num meam fidem destruere velis, constat ex significatione `occidere' quod sit destruere, de qua sequitur; et ex significatione `viri Hebraei,' qui hic 
est `me,' quod sit qui ab Ecclesia; ita quoque fides, nam fides est Ecclesiae, {1}quae ita unitae sunt, ut qui destruit fidem apud aliquem, {2}is destruat Ecclesiam apud illum; et hoc quoque est `occidere 
illum,' nam qui fidem, is vitam spiritualem aufert; vita quae remanet est vita quae vocatur `mors'; inde patet quod per `num ad occidendum me tu dicis?' significetur num meam fidem destruere velis. 	2 
Quod `occidere' sit vitam spiritualem auferre, patet a locis pluribus in Verbo, ut apud Jeremiam, Abripe eos sicut pecudem ad mactationem, et destina eos ad diem occisionis: quousque lugebit 
terra, et herba omnis agri exarescet, propter malitiam habitantium in ea consumentur bestiae et avis, xii 3, 4; </p>
<p>`dies occisionis' pro tempore vastationis Ecclesiae cum non amplius aliqua fides quia 
non charitas; {3}`terra quae lugebit' pro Ecclesia `herba omnis agri {4}' pro {5}omni vero scientifico Ecclesiae; `consumentur bestiae et avis' pro quod bona et vera; quod `terra' sit Ecclesia, videatur 
n. 566, 662, 1067, 1262, 1413, 1607, 1733, 1850, 2117, 2118 fin., 2928, 3355, 4447, (ax)4535, 5577; quod `herba {6}' sit verum {7}scientificum, constat a locis in Verbo ubi herba nominatur, (d)et 
quod ager sit id quod est Ecclesiae, n. 2971, 3310, 3766; quod `bestiae' sint {8}affectiones boni, ita bona, n. 45, 46, 142, 143, 246, 714, 715, 719, 1823, 2179, 2180, 3218, 3519, 5198; quod `aves' sint 
{9}affectiones veri, n. 5149 {10}; inde constare potest quis sensus illorum verborum est, et quoque quod sensus spiritualis sit in singulis {11}ibi; quisque videre potest quod absque interiore sensu 
{12} non intelligeretur quid `dies occisionis,' {13} quid quod `{14}lugebit terra,' quod `herba omnis agri exarescet, propter malitiam habitantium in ea,' et quod `consumentur bestiae et avis': apud 
Sachariam, 3 Sic dixit Jehovah Deus meus, Pasce oves occisionis, quas possessores earum occidunt, (x)xi 4, 5; </p>
<p>`oves occisionis' manifeste pro illis quorum fidem possessores destruunt: apud Ezechielem, Profanasti 
Me apud populum Meum, pro pugillis hordeorum, et pro frustis panis, ad occidendum animas quae non mori debent, et ad vivificandum animas quae non vivere debent, xiii 19; </p>
<p>hic `occidere' 
etiam manifeste pro destruere vitam spiritualem, hoc est, fidem et charitatem: apud Esaiam, Quid facietis die visitationis et vastationis? infra {15}vinctos, et infra occisos cadent, x 3, 4; </p>
<p>ibi `occisi' 
pro illis qui in inferno, {16}ita qui in malis et falsis': apud 4 eundem, Tu projectus es e sepulcro tuo sicut surculus abominabilis, vestimentum occisorum, confossi gladio, non adunaberis cum 
iis in sepulcro, nam terram tuam perdidisti, populum tuum occidisti, xiv 19, 20; </p>
<p>`occisi' pro illis qui privati vita spirituali; `populum occidisti' pro quod destruxerit vera et bona fidei: apud Johannem, Fur

<p>`occidere' pro vitam fidei destruere; quare dicitur `Ego (x)veni ut vitam habeant': apud Marcum, Tradet 
frater fratrem in mortem, et pater liberos, et consurgent liberi contra parentes, et occident illos, xiii 12; </p>
<p>ibi de ultimis temporibus Ecclesiae cum non amplius aliqua charitas et ideo nec aliqua
