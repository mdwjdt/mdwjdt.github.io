<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6427节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6427.</strong>这两节在内义上所包含的内容从所给出的解释明显可知。但即便如此，若不了解属灵国度的性质，这些内容必仍模糊不清、令人费解。该国度是由那些拥有信之真理，使这真理成为其生活的一部分，进而把它转化为良善的人组成的。因为当一个人照信之真理生活时，它就变成良善，被称为真理之良善；然而，就其本质而言，它是行为中的真理。在主的属灵教会，信之真理是有所不同的，因为在一个教会被说成是真理的东西，在另一个教会却被说成不是真理，这取决于每个教会的教义。教义事物以这种方式被称为真理。与良善结合，并构成属灵教会良善的，就是这些真理。所以，属灵教会良善的品质就是其真理的品质，因为真理赋予良善以品质，或说良善从真理获得自己的品质。<br />由此可见，属灵教会的良善是不洁的；并且由于它是不洁的，所以属灵人若不通过神性方法，就不能被准许进入天堂。最重要的神性方法在于主降世，使祂自己里面的人身变成神性；属灵人通过这种方式得救。然而，由于他们身上的良善是不洁的，所以他们不可避免地受到邪恶与虚假的攻击，从而陷入争战。但主规定，他们里面的不洁之物通过这些争战逐渐得以洁净；因为主为他们争战。这就是“女儿爬到墙上”和“弓箭手苦害他，向他射箭，仇恨他。约瑟要坐在他弓的力量里，他的手臂因大能的雅各之手而强壮；以色列的牧者、石头是从那里而出的”所表示的。<br />可参看前面关于那些属于属灵教会之人的阐述，即：就真理和由真理所产生的良善而言，他们处在模糊之中（<a href="2708.htm">2708</a>，<a href="2715.htm">2715</a>，<a href="2718.htm">2718</a>，<a href="2831.htm">2831</a>，<a href="2935.htm">2935</a>，<a href="2937.htm">2937</a>，<a href="3241.htm">3241</a>，<a href="3246.htm">3246</a>，<a href="3833.htm">3833</a>，<a href="6289.htm">6289</a>节）；这种模糊被主的神性人身光照（<a href="2716.htm">2716</a>节）；属灵国度在主到来之前不同于主到来之后（<a href="6372.htm">6372</a>节）；主降世是为了拯救属灵人；他们通过主的神性人身得救（参看<a href="2661.htm">2661</a>，<a href="2716.htm">2716</a>，<a href="2833.htm">2833</a>，<a href="2834.htm">2834</a>，<a href="3969.htm">3969</a>节）。从这些章节也明显可知，“他的手臂因大能的雅各之手而强壮；以色列的牧者、石头是从那里而出的”表示进行争战力量所拥有的能力是从主之神性人身的全能那里获得的，属灵国度所拥有的一切良善与真理皆源于此（<a href="6424.htm">6424</a>-<a href="6426.htm">6426</a>节）。</p>

The contents of these two verses in the internal sense is plain from the things unfolded, but still these things must needs be obscure unless the nature of the spiritual kingdom is known. This kingdom 
consists of those who are in the truth of faith, but who make this the truth of life, and thus good; for when the truth of faith is lived, it becomes good, and is called the "good of truth," but in 
its essence it is truth in act. In the Lord's spiritual church the truth of faith is various, for that is said to be truth in one church which in another is said not to be truth, and this according to 
the doctrine of each; thus it is doctrinal things that are called truths. These truths are what are conjoined with good, and make the good of the spiritual church; and thus its good becomes such as is 
its truth, for good has its quality from truths. [2] Hence it is evident that the good of the spiritual church is impure; and because it is impure, the spiritual cannot be admitted into heaven except 
by Divine means. The veriest Divine means was that the Lord came into the world and made the Human in Himself Divine; by this the spiritual were saved. But because the good with them is impure, they 
must needs be infested by evils and falsities, and thus be in combats; but the Lord provides that by means of these combats the impurity in them may gradually be purified, for the Lord fights for them. 
This is what is signified by "the daughter marched upon the wall," and by "the archers embittered him, and shot at him, and hated him, and he shall sit in the strength of his bow, and the arms of 
his hands are made strong by the hands of the mighty Jacob, from whence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel." [3] See what has already been said about those who are of the spiritual church, namely, 
that they are in obscurity as to truth and the derivative good (n. 2708, 2715, 2718, 2831, 2935, 2937, 3241, 3246, 3833, 6289); that this obscurity is illumined by the Lord's Divine Human (n. 2716); that 
before the Lord's coming there was not such a spiritual kingdom as after His coming (n. 6372); that the Lord came into the world in order to save the spiritual; and that they are saved by means of 
the Lord's Divine Human (see n. 2661, 2716, 2833, 2834, 3969). Hence also it is plain that by "the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty Jacob, from whence is the shepherd the 
stone of Israel," is signified the power of fighting derived from the omnipotence of the Lord's Divine Human, whence is all the good and truth in the spiritual kingdom (n. 6424-6426). </p>

What these three<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> verses contain in the internal sense is evident from the explanations that have been given. But even so, they inevitably remain obscure unless one knows what the spiritual kingdom is 
like. This kingdom consists of those who, possessing the truth of faith, make this truth part of their life and thus convert it into good. When a person leads a life in accordance with the truth of 
faith it is made into good and is called the good of truth; yet essentially it is truth in action. The truth of faith in the Lord's spiritual Church is varying, for in one Church that is said to be the 
truth which in another is said not to be the truth, the doctrine taught by each Church being what leads to such variation. And in this way particular teachings come to be called truths. These truths 
are the ones that become linked to good and constitute good in the spiritual Church. Consequently the quality of its good comes to be that of its truth, for truths give good the quality it possesses. </p>

From this one may see that the good of the spiritual Church is impure and that as it is impure spiritual people cannot be admitted into heaven except by Divine means. The most important Divine 
means consisted in the Lord's coming into the world and making the Human within Himself Divine. By that means spiritual people have been saved; yet because with them good is impure they are inevitably 
under attack from evils and falsities and so are engaged in conflict. But the Lord sees to it that through those conflicts what is impure with them is gradually made purer; for the Lord fights for them. 
These considerations are what are meant by 'a daughter marches onto the wall' and by 'they exasperate him and shoot at him and hate him, do the archers; and he will sit in the strength of his bow, 
and the arms of his hands are made strong by the hands of the powerful Jacob; from there is the shepherd, the stone of Israel'. </p>

<p><b>[3]</b>
 See what has been stated already about those who belong to the 
spiritual Church: </p>
<p> They live in obscurity so far as truth and the good resulting from truth are concerned, <a href="2708.htm">2708</a>, <a href="2715.htm">2715</a>, <a href="2718.htm">2718</a>, <a href="2831.htm">2831</a>, <a href="2935.htm">2935</a>, <a href="2937.htm">2937</a>, <a href="3241.htm">3241</a>, <a href="3246.htm">3246</a>, <a href="3833.htm">3833</a>, <a href="6289.htm">6289</a>. </p>
<p>Light is brought to that obscurity 
from the Lord's Divine Human, <a href="2716.htm">2716</a>. Before the Lord's Coming the spiritual kingdom was not the same as it was after His Coming, <a href="6372.htm">6372</a>. </p>
<p>The Lord came into the world to save those who are spiritual; 
and they are saved by means of the Lord's Divine Human, <a href="2661.htm">2661</a>, <a href="2716.htm">2716</a>, <a href="2833.htm">2833</a>, <a href="2834.htm">2834</a>, <a href="3969.htm">3969</a>. From these places it is also evident that 'the arms of his hands are made strong by the hands of the powerful 
Jacob; from there is the shepherd, the stone of Israel' means the power that the forces involved in fighting possess, received from the almighty power of the Lord's Divine Human, from which springs 
all the goodness and truth that the spiritual kingdom possesses, <a href="6424.htm">6424</a>-<a href="6426.htm">6426</a>.

Quid in binis his versibus in sensu interno continetur, patet ab illis quae explicata sunt, sed usque haec non possunt non obscura esse, nisi sciatur quale regnum spirituale est; hoc regnum consistit 
ex illis qui in vero fidei sunt, sed qui hoc verum faciunt vitae, ac ita bonum; {1} verum fidei cum vivitur secundum illud fit bonum, et vocatur bonum veri, sed est in (t)essentia sua verum actu; verum 
fidei in spirituali Ecclesia Domini est varium, nam in una Ecclesia dicitur id verum quod in altera dicitur non verum, et hoc secundum doctrinam cujusvis; ita doctrinalia sunt quae vocantur vera; 
haec vera sunt quae conjunguntur bono et faciunt bonum Ecclesiae spiritualis; inde tale fit bonum quale est verum, nam bonum quale suum habet a veris; [2]inde constare potest quod bonum Ecclesiae spiritualis 
sit impurum, et quia impurum quod spirituales in caelum admitti nequeant nisi per (t)Divina media; ipsissimum Divinum medium fuit quod Dominus in mundum venerit, et Humanum in Se Divinum fecerit; 
per id salvati sunt spirituales; sed quia bonum apud illos impurum est, non possunt non {2}infestari a malis et falsis, et sic in pugna esse; sed Dominus providet, {3}ut per pugnas illas impurum apud 
(c)eos per gradus purificetur, nam Dominus pugnat pro illis; haec sunt quae significantur per quod `filia incedit super murum', et quod `exacerbent eum, et jaculentur, et odio habeant eum sagittarii; 
et sedebit in valido arcus sui, et roborantur brachia manuum ejus a manibus potentis Jacobi, exinde pastor lapis Israelis'. [3] Videantur quae de illis qui ab Ecclesia spirituali prius dicta sunt 
quod nempe illis obscurum sit quoad verum et inde bonum, n. 2708, 2715, 2718, 2831, 2935, 2937, 3241, 3246, 3833, 6289; quod hoc obscurum illuminetur a Divino Humano Domini, n. 2716; quod ante Adventum 
Domini non regnum spirituale fuerit quale post Ipsius Adventum, n. 6372; quod Dominus venerit in mundum ut salvaret spirituales; et quod salventur per Divinum Humanum Domini, n. 2661, 2716, 2833, 2834, 
3969; inde quoque patet quod per   `roborantur brachia manuum ejus a manibus potentis Jacobi, exinde pastor, lapis Israelis' significetur potentia virium pugnandi ab omnipotentia Divini Humani Domini,
