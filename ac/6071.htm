<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6071节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6071.</strong>“把他们带到法老面前”表引入记忆知识。这从“法老”的代表清楚可知，“法老”是指总体的记忆知识（参看<a href="5799.htm">5799</a>，<a href="6015.htm">6015</a>节）。“带到他面前”之所以表示引入，是因为介绍他们的目的就是引入他们，也就是引入教会的真理，这些真理就是“雅各的儿子们”。关于教会的这些真理被引入教会记忆知识的必要性，可参前文（<a href="6004.htm">6004</a>，<a href="6023.htm">6023</a>，<a href="6052.htm">6052</a>节）；但由于如今这是个不为人知的主题，故必须进一步予以说明。<br />如今教会的记忆知识是指那些属于圣言字义的事物。除非来自内义的真理被引入这些记忆知识，否则，心智就会受迷惑，陷入各种异端邪说；但是，一旦真理被引入它们，心智就不会受迷惑，陷入异端邪说。例如，人若从圣言字义获知神会发怒、惩罚，将人引入试探，投入地狱，作恶，就有可能受迷惑，陷入关于神的错误观念，如：邪恶，因而与神对立的东西是从良善本身，也就是神那里出来的；而事实上，良善来自良善，邪恶来自邪恶。不过，如果内层真理被引入这记忆知识，如这一真理：正是人里面的邪恶使人发怒，将他引入试探、惩罚他，把他投入地狱，并且不断产生进一步的邪恶，那么他从字义所知的这个记忆知识就会呈现出完全不同的表象。这个问题就像国家所立的法律，这些法律出自君王，但惩罚的痛苦却不能归因于君王，而是归因于那些作恶的人。<br />还有这个真理：地狱是一切邪恶的源头，并且被允许成为邪恶的源头；为了人的缘故，这是无法避免的。因为人陷在邪恶中，他的生命就是由邪恶产生的；因此，他若不留在邪恶中，就无法处于自由，从而得以改造。然而，除了良善外，没有什么东西是从神来的，因为神在人允许的范围内将邪恶折向良善。<br />还有这一真理：信仰的最总体事物首先到来，后来必充满个体真理。下面这个总体记忆知识就是如此：所发生的一切事，无一例外，皆来自神，包括惩罚所带来的痛苦。至于这些痛苦以哪种方式来自神，这不得不等到以后才能获知；经许可所发生之事的性质和源头也是如此。同样还有这一真理：对神的一切敬拜必始于神圣的敬畏，这种敬畏含有以下信仰在里面，即：神会奖赏好人，惩罚坏人。简单人和小孩子必须相信这一点，因为他们还不明白许可；他们的信仰遵照主的这些话：<br />惟有能把灵魂和身体都灭在地狱里的，正要怕祂。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太10.28.htm">10:28</a>）<br />所以，尽管一开始他们因为害怕不敢作恶，但伴随良善的爱却逐渐被引入，然后他们开始知道并发觉，除了良善外，没有什么东西是从神来的，邪恶来自他们自己，最后知道，一切邪恶皆来自地狱。<br />此外，天堂里的人发觉，除了良善外，没有什么东西是从神来的；而地狱里的人却说，一切邪恶皆从神来，因为是神允许的，祂没有移除邪恶。但作为回应，灵人界里的人被告知：如果邪恶真的从他们那里被拿走，他们就不拥有任何生命，陷入邪恶的世人也是如此。他们还被告知：他们里面的邪恶会照着律法自我惩罚，惩罚所带来的痛苦最终使他们避免作恶；对恶人的惩罚就是对善人的保护。<br />再加这一个：陷入邪恶的人，以及其敬拜是缺乏任何内在之物的外在之人，如犹太人，无论如何都要活在对神的畏惧中，并相信祂就是那实施惩罚的人；因为他们能出于对神的畏惧行善，却绝无可能出于爱行善，或说对神的畏惧能使他们行善，但爱却永远不能。当这些和其它许多真理被引入上述取自圣言字义的记忆知识时，这记忆知识便呈现出完全不同的表象。因为这时，该记忆知识变得像透明的容器，里面所盛的真理照亮这容器，使它看上去无非是一个总体真理。</p>

And set them before Pharaoh. That this signifies insinuation into memory-knowledges, is evident from the representation of Pharaoh, as being memory-knowledge in general (see n. 5799, 6015). Insinuation 
is signified by "setting before him," because the end in presenting them was to insinuate them, that is, the truths of the church, for these are the "sons of Jacob." As regards truths, that they must 
be insinuated into the memory-knowledges of the church, see n. 6004, 6023, 6052; but as at this day this is a subject about which nothing is known, it must be illustrated further. At the present day 
the memory-knowledges of the church are those which belong to the literal sense of the Word. Unless truths from the internal sense are insinuated into these memory-knowledges, the mind can be drawn 
into every heresy; but when truths have been insinuated into them, the mind cannot be drawn into heresies. [2] For example, he who has learned from the literal sense of the Word that God is angry, that 
He punishes, leads into temptations, casts into hell, and causes evil, may be drawn into false ideas about God, as that from good itself, which is God, can come forth evil, thus what is opposite to 
Him; when yet from good comes good, and from evil comes evil. But this memory-knowledge appears with quite another aspect if interior truths are insinuated into it, as for instance this truth: that it 
is the evil with man that causes him to be angry, that leads into temptations, punishes, casts into hell, and from itself is continually producing evils; and that this matter is circumstanced as are 
the laws in kingdoms, which laws are from the king, while the evils of penalty are not from the king, but from those who do evils. [3] Then again this truth: that hells exist, the source of all evil, 
and that this is permitted because it is unavoidable for man's sake, seeing that he is in evil and his life is thence derived, and therefore unless he is left in evil he cannot be in freedom, thus cannot 
be reformed. Nevertheless nothing but good comes from God, for insofar as man suffers it, God bends evil into good. [4] Also this truth: that the most general things are to be believed first, and 
that they are afterward to be illustrated by individual truths; as for instance this general memory-knowledge: that all things which take place are from God, thus also the evils of penalty; but in 
what manner these are from God is to be learned afterward, and also the nature and origin of that which is done from permission. [5] In like manner this truth: that all worship of God must needs begin 
with holy fear, within which is the thought that God will reward the good and punish the evil. The simple and little children must believe this, because they do not yet apprehend what permission is-even 
according to the Lord's words, "Rather fear Him who is able to destroy both body and soul in hell" (Matt. 10:28); and when they begin by not daring through fear to do what is evil, there is gradually 
insinuated love together with good, and then they begin to know and perceive that nothing but good is from God, and that evil is from themselves, and at last that all evil is from hell. [6] Moreover 
they who are in heaven perceive that nothing but good is from God; but they who are in hell say that all evil is from God, because He permits it, and does not remove it. But to those who are in the 
world of spirits it is said in reply, that if evil were taken away from them they would have no life, neither would a man who is in evil; and that the evil which is in them punishes itself according 
to law, and that by reason of the evils of penalty they at last abstain from doing evils; and also that the punishment of the evil is the protection of the good. Add to this that they who are in evil, 
and also they who are in external worship without internal, as were the Jews, must by all means be in fear of God, and believe that He punishes; for from fear of God they are able to do what is good, 
but in no wise from love. [7] When these and many other truths are insinuated into the memory-knowledge above referred to, it appears in a very different aspect; for then this memory-knowledge becomes 
like a transparent vessel, in which the truths that shine through cause the vessel to be seen no otherwise than as one general truth. </p>

'And placed them before Pharaoh' means an introduction into factual knowledge. This is clear from the representation of 'Pharaoh' as factual knowledge in general, dealt with in <a href="5799.htm">5799</a>, <a href="6015.htm">6015</a>. An introduction 
is meant by 'placing before him', for the intention behind his presentation of them was so that he might introduce them, that is, the truths of the Church, since these are meant by 'the sons of 
Jacob'. Regarding the need for the truths known to the Church to be introduced into the Church's factual knowledge, see <a href="6004.htm">6004</a>, <a href="6023.htm">6023</a>, <a href="6052.htm">6052</a>; but as this is a subject that is not known about at the present 
day, let some more light be shed on it. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The facts known to the Church are at the present day the things stated in the literal sense of the Word. Unless truths from the internal sense are introduced 
into those facts the mind can be misled into all kinds of heresy; but once truths have been introduced into them the mind cannot be misled into heresies. For example the person who has learned 
from the literal sense of the Word statements that God can be angry, punish, lead into temptations, cast into hell, and do evil can be misled into false ideas about God. He may be led to think that Goodness 
itself, which is what God is, can be the source even of evil, thus the opposite of what He is, when in fact good comes from good, and evil from evil. But this fact [which he knows from the literal 
sense] takes on a different appearance if interior truths are introduced into it, such as the truth that evil in a person is what creates anger in him, leads into temptations, punishes, casts into 
hell, and constantly brings forth further evils. There is also the truth that the situation with these woes is like the laws that countries have; the laws come from the monarch, but the miseries that 
come with punishment are not attributable to the monarch but to those who commit evils. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Then there is the truth that the hells are the source of all evil and are allowed to be the source of it 
because on man's account it cannot be otherwise. For he is sunk in evil and his life arises out of it, and therefore unless he is left in evil he cannot be in freedom, or thus be reformed. Even so, nothing 
but good comes from God, for to the extent a person allows, God turns that evil towards what is good. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 There is too the truth that the very general outlines of belief must come first, after 
which they must be filled out with individual truths. This is so with the general piece of knowledge that all things which happen come without exception from God, including the miseries that punishment 
brings. In what way those miseries come from Him has to be learned subsequently, as also do the nature and source of what happens by permission. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 There is likewise the truth that all worship 
of God inevitably has its beginning in holy fear, which holds within it the belief that God rewards good people and punishes the bad. Simple people and young children must believe this because they 
have no understanding as yet of permission; and their belief is in keeping with the Lord's words,  </p>
<blockquote>
Rather, fear Him who is able to destroy both body and soul in Gehenna. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2010:28&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 10:28</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>So although 
to begin with it is out of fear that they do not dare to do evil, love accompanied by good is gradually introduced, and then they start to know and perceive that nothing but good comes from God, and 
that evil comes from themselves; then at length that all evil comes from hell. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 Furthermore those in heaven perceive that nothing but good comes from God; but those in hell say that everything evil 
comes from God because He permits it and does not take it away. But in reply to this those of them who are in the world of spirits are told that if evil were taken away from them they would not possess 
any life; and neither would anyone in the world who is engrossed in evil. They are also told that the evil within them punishes itself in accordance with the law, and that the miseries that punishment 
brings eventually causes them to refrain from the doing of evils, also that the punishment of evil persons is the protection of the good. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 Added to all this is the consideration that people 
engrossed in evil, also those whose worship is external devoid of anything internal, as that of the Jews was, must live altogether in fear of God and in a belief that He is the one who punishes; for 
their fear of God can lead them to do what is good, but love never can. When these and many other truths are introduced into that known fact [drawn from the literal sense of the Word] it takes on a 
completely different appearance. It becomes like a transparent vase containing truths which shine through and make the vase look like nothing else than a single and general body of truth. </p>

`Et statuit illos coram Pharaone':  quod significet insinuationem in scientifica, constat ex repraesentatione `Pharaonis' quod sit scientificum in communi, de qua n. 5799, 6015; insinuatio significatur 
per `statuere coram illo', nam finis quod exhibuerit illos, erat ut insinuaret, hoc est, vera Ecclesiae, nam haec sunt `filii Jacobi'.  De veris quod insinuanda in scientifica Ecclesiae, videatur 
n. 6304, 6023, 6052; at quia hoc hodie est res ignota, adhuc illustrandum est:  scientifica Ecclesiae sunt hodie illa quae sunt sensus litteralis Verbi; in illa scientifica nisi vera ex sensu interno 
insinuantur, potest mens abduci in omnem haeresin; [2]at cum illis insinuata sunt vera tunc mens non abduci in haereses potest, ut pro exemplo: qui ex sensu litterali Verbi hausit quod Deus irascatur, 
puniat, inducat in tentationes, conjiciat in infernum, et faciat malum, is abduci in falsas ideas de Deo potest, ut quod ab Ipso Bono, quod est Deus, possit etiam malum provenire, ita quod oppositum 
Ipsi, cum tamen bonum a bono, et malum a malo venit; at hoc scientificum alia facie apparet si ei interiora vera insinuantur; prout hoc verum quod malum apud hominem sit quod facit hominem irasci, quod 
ducit in tentationes, punit, conjicit in infernum, et ex se continue producit mala; et quod illa se habeant sicut leges in regnis; leges sunt ex rege, mala autem   poenae non sunt ex rege verum ex illis 
qui mala faciunt.  [3]Tum quoque hoc verum:  quod inferna sint ex quibus omne malum, et quod illis hoc permittatur quia est inevitabile propter hominem; is enim in malo est et vita ejus inde, quare 
nisi relinquitur in malo, non potest esse in libero, ita non reformari; usque tamen a Deo non venit nisi bonum, nam quantum sinit homo, flectit Deus id in bonum. [4]Etiam hoc verum:  quod communissima 
primum credenda sint et postmodum illa illustranda per vera singularia, ita commune hoc scientificum quod omnia quaecumque existunt, a Deo sint, ita quoque mala poenae; at quomodo illa a Deo sunt, 
postmodum discendum, tum quale et unde id quod ex permissione fit.  [5]Pariter hoc verum:  quod omnis cultus Dei non possit non principium ducere ex sancto timore, in quo inest quod Deus remuneret bonos 
et puniat malos; simplices et infantes hoc credent quia nondum capiunt quid permissio, et hoc secundum Domini verba, 	Timete potius Ipsum, Qui potest et corpus et animam  perdere in gehenna, Matth. 
x 28; </p>
<p>cum itaque in initio ex timore non facere malum audent, insinuatur successive amor cum bono, et tunc scire et percipere incipiunt quod non nisi quam bonum a Deo, et quod malum ab ipsis; et tandem 
quod omne malum ab inferno.  [6]Praeterea qui in caelo sunt, percipiunt quod nihil nisi bonum a Deo; qui autem in inferno sunt, dicunt quod omne malum a Deo quia permittit et non aufert; sed responsum 
ferunt illi eorum qui in mundo spirituum sunt, si malum illis auferretur quod nulla eis vita, nec foret homini qui in malo; et quod malum quod in illis semet puniat secundum legem, et quod per 
mala poenae tandem a malis faciendis abstineant, ut et quod poena malorum sit tutela bonorum.  [7]Accedit quod qui in malo sunt, tum qui in externo cultu absque interno, ut fuerunt Judaei, omnino debeant 
esse in timore pro Deo et credere quod puniat, ex timore enim pro Deo possunt bonum facere, nusquam autem ex amore.  Cum haec et plura alia vera insinuantur in id scientificum, apparet id prorsus 
alia facie, fit enim id scientificum tunc sicut vas pellucidum in quo vera transparentia faciunt ut vas non videatur aliter quam ut unum commune verum. </p>
