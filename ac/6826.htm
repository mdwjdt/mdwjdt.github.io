The Internal Sense.      Verses 1-3. And Moses was feeding the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian; and he led the flock behind the wilderness, and came into the mountain of God, 
to Horeb. And the angel of Jehovah was seen by him in a flame of fire out of the midst of the bramble; and he saw, and behold the bramble burned with fire, and the bramble was in no wise consumed. And 
Moses said, I will therefore go aside, and see this great vision, why the bramble is not burnt. "And Moses was feeding the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian," signifies that the 
law from the Divine was instructing those who were in the truth of simple good; "priest," is the good of the church where such are; "and he led the flock behind the wilderness," signifies after they 
had undergone temptations; "and came unto the mountain of God," signifies that the good of love Divine appeared to him; "to Horeb," signifies its quality; "and the angel of Jehovah was seen by him," 
signifies the Lord as to the Divine Human; "in a flame of fire out of the midst of the bramble," signifies love Divine in the truth of memory-knowledge; "and he saw, and behold the bramble burned with 
fire," signifies a noticing that the truth of memory-knowledge was full of the good of love Divine; "and the bramble was in no wise consumed," signifies Divine truth united to Divine good in the natural; 
"and Moses said," signifies perception from the law from the Divine; "I will therefore go aside, and see this great vision," signifies reflection upon this revelation; "why the bramble is not burnt," 
signifies that such is the union. </p>

THE INTERNAL SENSE </p>
<p>Verses 1-3 And Moses was feeding the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian; and he led the flock to the back of the wilderness, and came to the mountain of God, 
to Horeb. And the angel of Jehovah appeared to him in a flame of fire from the middle of a bramble bush; and he saw, and behold, the bramble bush was burning with fire, and the bramble bush was not 
at all being consumed. And Moses said, I will turn aside therefore, and see this great sight, why the bramble bush is not burnt. </p>
<p>'And Moses was feeding the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest 
of Midian' means that the law from God instructed those who were guided by the truth that went with simple good, 'the priest of Midian' being the good of the Church where those people were. 'And 
he led the flock to the back of the wilderness' means after the temptations they had undergone. 'And came to the mountain of God' means that after them the good of God's love appeared. 'To Horeb' means 
the essential nature of it. 'And the angel of Jehovah appeared to him' means the Lord's Divine Human. 'In a flame of fire from the middle of a bramble bush' means God's love present in true factual 
knowledge. 'And he saw, and behold, the bramble bush was burning with fire' means a recognition that true factual knowledge was full of the good of God's love. 'And the bramble bush was not at all being 
consumed' means Divine Truth united to Divine Good in the natural. 'And Moses said' means a perception coming from the law from God. 'I will turn aside therefore, and see this great sight' means reflection 
on this revelation. 'Why the bramble bush is not burnt' means that such a union exists. </p>

<p>Vers.  1-3.  Et Moscheh fuit pascens gregem Jethronis soceri sui sacerdotis Midianis, et duxit gregem post desertum, et venit ad montem Dei Chorebum.  
Et visus angelus Jehovae ad illum in flamma ignis e medio rubi; et vidit, et ecce rubus ardebat igne, et rubus nullatenus consumebatur.  Et dixit Moscheh, Secedam ergo, et videbo visionem magnam hanc, 
quare non comburitur rubus.  `Et Moscheh fuit pascens gregem Jethronis soceri sui sacerdotis Midianis' significat quod lex a Divino instrueret illos qui in vero simplicis boni; `sacerdos Midianis' est 
bonum Ecclesiae ubi illi: `et duxit gregem post desertum' significat postquam tentationes subierunt: `et venit ad montem Dei' significat quod bonum amoris Divini (x)dein appareret: `Chorebum' significat 
quale: `et visus angelus Jehovae ad illum' significat Dominum quoad Divinum Humanum: `in flamma ignis e medio rubi' significat amorem Divinum in vero scientifico: `et vidit, et ecce rubus ardebat 
igne' significat apperceptionem quod verum scientificum esset plenum bono amoris Divini: `et rubus nullatenus consumebatur' significat Divinum Verum unitum Divino Bono in naturali: `et dixit Moscheh' 
significat perceptionem ex lege a Divino: `Secedam ergo, et videbo visionem magnam hanc' significat reflexionem super revelatione hac: `quare non comburitur rubus' significat quod talis unio sit. </p>
