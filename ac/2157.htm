<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2157节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2157.</strong>“若我祈求在你眼前蒙恩”表当主发觉那直觉时，其状态是敬重。这从这句话本身所包含的谦卑情感清楚可知；紧接着“求你不要离开你的仆人”这句话同样包含谦卑。圣言的每个具体细节里面都有情感和主题，属天天使觉察诸如存在于内义中的圣言的情感；而属灵天使则觉察诸如存在于内义中的圣言的主题。那些根据情感觉察圣言内义的人根本不关注表述主题的话语，而是通过情感和那情感的一系列细节为自己形成各种观念，并且以无穷的多样性这样做。以此处这句话为例，即“若我祈求在你眼前蒙恩，求你不要离开你的仆人”，他们觉察到的是处于人身的主谦卑的状态，不过，仅仅是谦卑的情感。通过这种情感，他们以一种无法言传的方式、多样性和丰富性为自己形成属天的观念。这种属天的观念几乎不能叫观念，确切地说，应被称作情感和直觉所产生的许多“灯光”。这些“灯光”照着贯穿于正被阅读的圣言里面所存在事物中的一连串情感而以连续的序列相继出现。<br />这表明属天天使的直觉、思维和言语比属灵天使的更妙不可言，更丰富得多，因为后者照着所使用的一系列表述而局限于主题（关于属天天使的言语具有这样的性质，可参看第一卷，<a href="1647.htm">1647</a>节）。正因如此，“若我祈求在你眼前蒙恩”这句话的属天之义表示当主发觉那直觉时，其状态是敬重。而且，“在你眼前蒙恩”是用于表达敬重的习惯用语，这从拉班对雅各的敬重可以看出来：<br />拉班对他说，我若在你眼前蒙恩。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创30.27.htm">30:27</a>）<br />也可从雅各对以扫的敬重看出来：<br />雅各说，不然，我若在你眼前蒙恩。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创33.10.htm">33:10</a>）<br />类似例子也出现在圣言的其它地方。</p>

If I pray I have found grace in Thine eyes. That this signifies the deference of the Lord's state when He observed that perception, may be seen from the affection of humiliation which there is in these 
very words; and also in those which directly follow-"Pass not I pray from over Thy servant"-in which likewise there is humiliation. In every particular in the Word there are both affection and subject 
matter. The celestial angels perceive the Word such as it is in the internal sense as to the affection; but the spiritual angels perceive it such as it is in the internal sense as to the matter. Those 
who perceive the Word in the internal sense as to the affection, pay no attention to the words which belong to the matter, but form for themselves ideas from the affection and its series, and this 
with endless variety. Here for example at the words, "If I pray I have found grace in Thine eyes, pass not I pray from over Thy servant," they perceive the Lord's state of humiliation in the Human, 
but only the affection of the humiliation. From this, in a manner, variety, and abundance inexpressible, they form for themselves celestial ideas, which can scarcely be called ideas, but rather so many 
lights of affections and perceptions, which follow in a continuous series, in accordance with the series of the affection of the things contained in the Word that is being read.  [2] This shows that 
the perception, thought, and speech of the celestial angels are more ineffable and much richer than the perception, thought, and speech of  the spiritual angels, the latter being simply determined to 
the subject matter [rem], in accordance with the series of the expressions. (That the speech of the celestial angels is of this nature, may be seen in volume 1, n. 1647.) Hence it is that these words, 
"If I pray I have found grace in Thine eyes," in the celestial sense signify the deference of the Lord's state when He observed that perception. Moreover to "find grace in thine eyes" was a customary 
mode of speech for every expression of deference; as may be seen from Laban's deference to Jacob: </p>
<p>     Laban said unto him, If I pray I have found grace in thine eyes (Gen. 30:27); </p>
<p>also from Jacob's 
deference to Esau: </p>
<p>     Jacob said, Nay, I pray, if I pray I have found grace in thine eyes (Gen. 33:10); and in like manner elsewhere in the Word. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2157</b></p><p><b>2157.</b>
'If now I have found grace in your eyes' means the respectful regard that became a feature of the Lord's state when He took notice of that perception. This becomes clear from the affection that produces 
the state of humility which these actual words imply and also those that follow immediately after, 'Do not, I beg of you, pass from over your servant', which also imply a state of humility. Within 
every individual part of the Word there are both affection and subject matter. Celestial angels perceive the Word as it exists in the internal sense as to the affection there, whereas spiritual angels 
perceive it as it exists in the internal sense as to the subject matter there. Those who perceive the Word in the internal sense as to the affection there do not pay any attention at all to the words, 
which are expressions of the subject matter, but instead form ideas for themselves from the affection and the consecutive details of that affection, and do so with endless variety. Here, for example, 
when they come to the words, 'If now I have found grace in your eyes, do not, I beg of you, pass from over your servant', they perceive the Lord's state of humiliation in the Human, yet only the affection 
that produces humility. From that affection - in a manner, variety, and profusion beyond words - they form celestial ideas for themselves which can hardly be called ideas. Rather they should be 
called so many 'lights' engendered by affections and perceptions - which follow one another in a continuous sequence according to the chain of affection that runs through the things present in the Word 
that is being read. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 From this it becomes clear that the perception, thought, and speech of celestial angels are more indescribable and far richer than the perception, thought, and speech of 
spiritual angels, the latter being limited to the subject matter, according with the sequence of expressions that are used. (That the nature of the speech of celestial angels is such, see Volume One, 
in <a href="1647.htm">1647</a>.) This explains why these words, 'If now I have found grace in your eyes', mean in the celestial sense the respectful regard that became a feature of the Lord's state when He took notice of that 
perception. What is more, 'finding grace in your eyes' was a customary phrase used in every expression of respect, as becomes clear from the respect offered by Laban to Jacob, </p>
<blockquote>
Laban said to him, 
If now I have found grace in your eyes. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2030:%2027&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 30: 27</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And from that offered by Jacob to Esau, </p>
<blockquote>
Jacob said, No, I beg of you; if now, I have found grace in your eyes. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2033:%2010&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 33: 10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And similar 
examples occur elsewhere in the Word. </p>

`Si quaeso inveni gratiam in oculis tuis': quod significet respectivum status Domini cum perceptionem illam animadvertit, constare potest ab affectione humiliationis quae in ipsis his verbis, tum quoque 
in mox sequentibus his, `ne quaeso transeas desuper servo tuo,' in quibus etiam humiliatio: in singulis quae in Verbo, inest et affectio et res; caelestes angeli Verbum percipiunt quale est in sensu 
interno quoad affectionem; at `spirituales angeli' quale est in sensu interno quoad rem; qui percipiunt Verbum in sensu interno quoad affectionem, nihil attendunt ad voces, quae sunt rei, sed formant 
sibi ideas ex affectione et ejus serie, et hoc cum varietate indefinita; ut hic ad verba `Si quaeso inveni gratiam in oculis tuis, ne quaeso transeas desuper servo tuo' percipiunt statum humiliationis 
Domini in Humano, sed unice affectionem humiliationis, inde ineffabili modo, varietate et copia, formant sibi ideas caelestes quae vix dici queunt ideae, sed totidem affectionum et perceptionum luces, 
quae in continua serie sequuntur secundum seriem affectionis rerum quae in Verbo quod legitur; [2] inde constare potest quod perceptio, cogitatio et loquela angelorum caelestium sit ineffabilior 
et multo opulentior perceptione, cogitatione et loquela angelorum spiritualium, nam haec modo determinatur ad rem secundum seriem dictionum; de loquela (t)angelorum caelestium quod talis, videatur in 
Parte Prima n. 1647; inde est quod haec, `si quaeso inveni gratiam in Oculis tuis,' in sensu caelesti, significent respectivum status Domini cum perceptionem illam animadvertit: praeterea `invenire gratiam 
in Oculis tuis' fuit formula sollemnis in omni respectivo; ut constare potest ex Labanis respectivo ad Jacobum, 	Dixit ad eum Laban, Si quaeso inveni gratiam in oculi tuis, Gen. xxx 27; </p>
<p>Jacobi 
ad Esavum, 	Dixit Jacobus, Ne quaeso, si quaeso inveni gratiam in oculis tuis, Gen. xxxiii 10; </p>
<p>et similiter alibi in Verbo. </p>
