<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8378.</strong>他们还说，他们预备食物不是美味，主要关注食物的用处；他们补充说，他们发现有用的食物是很有滋味的。关于这个问题，灵人们进行了一次讨论；他们说，对食物的这种态度对人是有益的，因为这样他就从心里渴望拥有一个在健康身体中的健康心智。但那些让味觉占主导的人则不然，由于这种态度，身体会生病，至少内在衰弱，从而心智也衰弱。因为心智的活动依赖于身体的接受器官的状况，正如视觉取决于眼睛的状况。后一种态度会导致疯狂的想法，即认为生活的一切乐趣，就是人们所说的至善，在于奢侈和肉体享受。这也导致在思维和判断方面的愚钝，以及在身体和世界方面的精明。这使得人就像纯粹的动物，这些人也不恰当地把自己比作动物。</p>

They said moreover that they do not prepare their food with reference to the taste, but chiefly with reference to use; adding that the food which is useful is to them savory. There was a discourse among 
the spirits on this subject, and it was said that this is advantageous for man, because in this way he has at heart a sound mind in a sound body; otherwise than with those with whom the taste rules, 
for then the body sickens, at the least is inwardly languid, and consequently also the mind, because this behaves according to the state of the recipient parts that belong to the body, just as the 
sight is according to the state of the eye. Hence the insanity of placing all the delight of life, and what they call the summum bonum, in luxury and pleasure. From this also comes corpulence in matters 
of thought and judgment; and quickness in the things of the body and the world. This results in the man having a likeness to a brute animal, with which also such persons do not unsuitably com-pare 
themselves. </p>

They said furthermore that they did not prepare food with a view to taste but primarily with a view to its usefulness, adding that they found useful food flavoursome. A discussion took place among the 
spirits on this matter, during which it was stated that such an attitude to food is beneficial to a person, because then at heart he desires to have a healthy mind in a healthy body. But it is different 
with those for whom taste is all-important because of this attitude the body is sick or at least inwardly languishes and consequently the mind also. For the activity of the mind is dependent on the 
condition of recipient parts, which belong to the body, just as sight is dependent on the condition of the eye. The latter attitude gives rise to the insanity of supposing that all the delight of life, 
and - as people call it - the highest good, lies in luxury and physical pleasure. It also gives rise to stupidity in such things as are matters of thought and judgement, and astuteness in such as 
have to do with the body and the world. This makes a person similar to a mere animal, to which such people not inappropriately also liken themselves. </p>

Insuper dicebant quod non praepararent cibum secundum gustum sed imprimis secundum usum; addebant quod cibus utilis illis sapidus sit.  De hac re inter spiritus sermo factus est, et dictum quod hoc 
{1} conveniat homini, nam sic ei cordi est, {2}quod mens sana sit in corpore sano; aliter ac apud illos apud quos gustus imperat, inde corpus aegrotat, ad minimum intus languet, consequenter etiam mens; 
nam haec se {3}gerit secundum statum partium recipientium quae sunt corporis, sicut visus secundum statum oculi; inde insania quod in luxurie et voluptate ponatur omne vitae jucundum, {4}ac ut vocant, 
summum bonum; inde etiam obesitas in talibus quae {5}cogitationis et judicii sunt, et sollertia in talibus quae sunt corporis {6}et mundi; ex hoc fit similitudo hominis cum animali bruto, cum quo 
etiam tales non incongrue se comparant. 	@1 i maxime$ 	@2 ut$ 	@3 habet$ 	@4 et$ 	@5 mentis$ 	@6 , unde$ </p>
