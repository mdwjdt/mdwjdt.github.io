<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6574节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6574.</strong>“好将生命赐给大民”表生命由此被赐予那些处于良善之真理的人。这从“生命”和“（人）民”的含义清楚可知：“生命”是指属灵生命（参看<a href="5890.htm">5890</a>，<a href="6032.htm">6032</a>节）；“（人）民”是指真理（<a href="1259.htm">1259</a>，<a href="1260.htm">1260</a>，<a href="3295.htm">3295</a>，<a href="3581.htm">3581</a>，<a href="4619.htm">4619</a>节），在此是指良善之真理，因为经上说“大民”。事实上，源于良善的真理大过产生良善的真理。因为前一种真理，即源于良善的真理本身是良善，因为它从良善形成，因而是处于自己形式中的良善。<br />约瑟在此与他哥哥们所说的这些话，即：“从前你们的意思是要害我，但神的意思原是好的，为要成就今日的光景，好将生命赐给大民”，是含有一个天堂的奥秘在里面的话。这奥秘就是：在来世，主允许地狱灵将善灵引入试探，进而引入虚假和邪恶。他们也竭尽全力如此行，因为当如此行时，他们就处于自己的生命及其快乐中。不过，在这种时候，主会亲自既直接，也间接通过天使与那些经历试探，并通过驳斥地狱灵的虚假，驱散他们的邪恶而进行抵制的人同在。更新、希望和胜利由此而来。对那些处于良善之真理的人来说，信之真理和仁之良善便以这种方式被植入得越来越深，并更牢固地得以强化。这就是赐予属灵生命的方法。<br />由此明显可知本节这些话在内义上表示什么，即：那些疏远真理与良善的人，如带来试探的灵人，所意图的，无非是邪恶；但神性会将这邪恶转变为良善，这一切要照着自永恒就存在的秩序；生命由此被赐予那些处于良善之真理的人。因为要知道，被允许以这种方式攻击善灵的地狱灵所意图的，无非是邪恶。事实上，他们渴望竭尽全力把善灵从天堂拖下来投入地狱；因为摧毁人的灵魂，进而永远毁灭他正是他们生命的最大快乐。不过，若不是为了良善能从中出来，也就是说，为了真理与良善在那些经历试探的人中间更牢固地得以成形，并得以强化这个目的，主根本不会允许他们做任何事。在整个灵界掌权的，是从主发出的目的；无论是什么事，哪怕是最小的事，若不是为了良善能从中出来，就都不会发生。这就是为何主的国度被称为目的和功用的国度。</p>

To make alive a great people. That this signifies that from this is life to those who are in the truths of good, is evident from the signification of "making alive," as being spiritual life (see n. 5890, 
6032); and from the signification of "people," as being truth (n. 1259, 1260, 3295, 3581, 4619), here the truth of good, because it is said a "great people." For truth from good is great in comparison 
with the truth from which good is, because the former truth (that which is from good) is in itself good, because formed from good; thus is good in its form. [2] The words which Joseph here spake 
to his brethren: "Ye thought evil against me, God thought it for good, in order to do as it is this day, to make alive a great people" are words which contain within them a secret of heaven, which secret 
is this. In the other life the Lord permits infernal spirits to lead the good into temptation, consequently to pour in evils and falsities; which also they do with all endeavor; for when they are 
doing this, they are in their life and its delight. But the Lord Himself is then present with those in temptation, both immediately, and mediately by angels, and resists by rebutting the falsities of 
the infernal spirits, and by dissipating their evil, thus giving refreshment, hope, and victory. Thus with those who are in the truths of good, the truths of faith and the goods of charity are more 
inwardly implanted and more strongly confirmed. This is the means by which spiritual life is bestowed. [3] From all this it is evident what is signified in the internal sense by the words in this verse, 
namely, that they who have been alienated from truth and good, as are the spirits who induce temptations, intend nothing but evil, but that the Divine turns it into good, and this according to order 
from eternity, whence comes life to those who are in the truths of good. For be it known that the infernal spirits to whom it is permitted thus to trouble the good, intend nothing but evil; for they 
desire with all their might to drag them down from heaven and cast them into hell; because it is the very delight of their life to destroy anyone as to his soul; thus to eternity. But not one whit is 
permitted them by the Lord, except to the end that good may come of it, namely, that truth and good may be brought into shape and strengthened with those who are in temptation. In the universal spiritual 
world reigns the end which proceeds from the Lord, which is that nothing whatever, not even the least thing, shall arise, except that good may come from it. Hence the Lord's kingdom is called a 
kingdom of ends and uses. </p>

'To bestow life on a great people' means that life is thereby imparted to those governed by the truths of good. This is clear from the meaning of 'bestowing life' as spiritual life, dealt with in <a href="5890.htm">5890</a>, <a href="6032.htm">6032</a>; and from the meaning of 'people' as truth, dealt with in <a href="1259.htm">1259</a>, <a href="1260.htm">1260</a>, <a href="3295.htm">3295</a>, <a href="3581.htm">3581</a>, <a href="4619.htm">4619</a>, here the truth of good since the expression 'a great people' is used; for truth that is derived from good 
is greater than truth giving rise to good. The former kind of truth - that which is derived from good - is in essence good because it is formed from good, and so is good in its own form. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The 
words which Joseph spoke now to his brothers - You thought evil against me; God thought [to turn] it into good, in order to do what is in accord with this day, to bestow life on a great people - are words 
that contain an arcanum of heaven. The arcanum they contain is this: The Lord allows the hells in the next life to lead the good into temptation, consequently to introduce falsities and evils. They 
also put all they have into doing this, for when they are doing it, they are in their element and are enjoying it. But at that time the Lord Himself is present directly - and by means of angels indirectly 
- with those undergoing temptation and is offering resistance by refuting the falsities of the spirits from hell and dispersing their evil. From this come renewal, hope, and victory. In this way 
the truths of faith and forms of the good of charity present with those who are governed by the truths of good are implanted more deeply and strengthened more firmly. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 From this one may see what 
is meant in the internal sense by the words in this verse, namely this: Those who have become alienated from truth and good, as the spirits who bring about temptations have, intend nothing but evil. 
But the Divine turns that evil into good, in accord with order existing from eternity; and life is thereby imparted to those governed by the truths of good. For it should be recognized that the spirits 
from hell who are allowed to attack the good in that way intend nothing but evil. They wish with all their might to drag them down from heaven and cast them into hell; for to destroy anyone's soul, 
thus to destroy him forever, is the sheer delight of their life. But they are not allowed by the Lord to do anything at all except for the sake of the end that good may come out of it, that is to say, 
so that truth and good may be made firmer and stronger with those who undergo temptation. In the entire spiritual world there reigns the end in view, emanating from the Lord, that nothing whatever 
should take place, not even the smallest thing, except in order that good may come out of it. This is why the Lord's kingdom is called a kingdom of ends and useful purposes. </p>

`Ad vivificandum populum magnum': quod significet quod inde vita illis qui in veris boni, constat ex significatione `vivificare' quod sit vita spiritualis, de qua n. 5890, 6032; ex significatione `populi' 
quod sit verum, de qua n. 1259, 1260, 3295, 3581, 4619, hic verum boni, quia dicitur `populus magnus', verum enim quod ex bono, magnum est prae vero ex quo bonum, nam illud verum, nempe quod ex 
bono, est in se bonum quia formatum a bono, ita bonum in sua forma.  [2] Verba, quae Josephus ad fratres suos nunc locutus est, nempe `Vos cogitastis super me malum, Deus cogitavit id in bonum, propter 
facere secundum diem hunc, ad vivificandum populum magnum', sunt verba quae arcanum caeli in se continent; arcanum quod continent, est hoc: Dominus permittit infernalibus in altera vita ut inducant 
bonos in {1}tentationem, consequenter ut infundant falsa et mala; quo etiam faciunt omni conatu, nam cum {2}id faciunt, in sua vita (c)et vitae jucundo sunt; sed tunc Dominus Ipse immediate, et per angelos 
mediate, apud illos qui in tentatione sunt, adest ac resistit, falsa spirituum infernalium refellendo et malum illorum dissipando, inde recreatio, spes et victoria; sic vera fidei et bona charitatis 
apud illos qui in veris boni sunt, interius implantantur et fortius confirmantur; hoc medium est per quod vita spiritualis donatur; [3] ex his constare potest quid in sensu interno significatur 
per verba in hoc versu, quod nempe qui abalienati sunt a vero et bono, ut sunt spiritus qui inducunt tentationes, nihil nisi malum intendant, sed quod Divinum vertat id in bonum, et hoc secundum ordinem 
ab aeterno, unde vita illis qui in veris boni.  Sciendum enim quod infernales spiritus quibus permittitur {3}bonos ita lacessere, `intendant nihil' nisi malum, volunt enim {4}omni vi illos e caelo 
detrahere et in infernum conjicere; perdere enim aliquem quoad animam, ita in aeternum, est ipsum jucundum vitae eorum; {5}ast ne hilum illis permittitur a Domino nisi ob finem ut inde eveniat bonum, 
(t)nempe ut {6}confirmetur et corroboretur apud {7}illos, qui in tentatione {8}sunt, verum et bonum.  In {9} universo mundo spirituali regnat finis qui procedit a Domino, qui est ut nihil prorsus, ne 
quidem minimum, existat nisi ut bonum inde eveniat; inde regnum Domini vocatur {10} regnum finium et usuum. @1 tentationes$ @2 A had id illis permittitur but altered to id faciunt$ @3 spiritum bonum$ @4
