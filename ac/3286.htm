<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3286节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3286.</strong>“因他妻子不生育，就为她”表神圣属世人尚不存在。这从“妻子”和“不生育”的含义清楚可知：“妻子”是指与理性良善联结的神性真理，如前一章所说明的，这真理由利百加来代表。“不生育”是指神圣属世人尚不存在。因为此中情形是这样：神圣属世人源于为父亲的理性神性良善和那里为母亲的神性真理。当神圣属世人尚不存在时，理性真理就被称为“不生育”，在此被称为“不生育的女人”。<br />人的情况是这样：当他正经历重生时，主就将良善，也就是对邻人的善意流入到他的理性中。这善意具有与其联结的、来自属世人的真理。这一切完成后，他的属世人仍算不上重生。谁都能从以下事实知道这一点，即：内在人或理性人经常与外在人或属世人争战；并且只要有争战，属世人就不会重生。当这属世人仍未重生时，真理方面的理性就不生育。总体上的情况是这样，每个细节同样是这样，理性人在这些细节上与属世人不一致。故就每个细节而言，真理方面的理性被视为不生育。<br />重生的行为不仅总体上，而且细节上主要围绕使属世人对应于理性人进行。属世人被主藉着理性带入这种对应关系。也就是说，良善被注入到理性中，真理被植入在这如土壤一样的良善中，然后属世人藉着理性真理被带入顺服状态。一旦属世人顺服，在这种情况下，它便处于对应状态；并且它会对应到人重生的程度。</p>

For his woman, because she was barren. That this signifies that the Divine natural was not yet, is evident from the signification of a "woman," as being Divine truth conjoined with the good of the rational, 
which truth was in the preceding chapter shown to be represented by Rebekah; and from the signification of "barren," as being that the Divine natural was not yet. For the case herein is this: 
The Divine natural had its origin from the Divine good of the rational as a father, and from the Divine truth therein as a mother; and when the Divine natural is not yet, then the truth of the rational 
is said to be "barren," here a "barren woman." [2] As regards man, the case is that when he is being regenerated, good is insinuated by the Lord into his rational (that is, good will to the neighbor), 
to which will or good is adjoined truth from the natural man; but when this has been done, the natural is not yet regenerate, as may be known from the fact that the internal or rational man often 
fights with the external or natural man; and so long as there is combat the natural is not regenerate; and when this is not regenerate, the rational is barren as to truth. Such is the case in general; 
and in like manner in every particular in which the rational dissents from the natural, the rational is said in that particular to be barren as to truth.  [3] The work of regeneration is chiefly concerned 
in bringing about the correspondence of the natural man to the rational man, not only in general, but also in particular; and the natural man is reduced to correspondence by the Lord through the 
rational, in that good is insinuated into the rational, and in this good as in ground truths are implanted, and then by means of rational truths the natural is reduced to obedience; and when it obeys, 
then it corresponds; and insofar as it corresponds, so far is the man regenerate. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3286</b></p><p><b>3286.</b>
'On behalf of his wife because she was barren' means that the Divine Natural did not as yet exist. This is clear from the meaning of 'a wife' as Divine Truth joined to the Divine Good of the Rational, 
which Truth, as shown in the previous chapter, is represented by 'Rebekah'; and from the meaning of 'barren' as the non-existence as yet of the Divine Natural. For the truth of the matter is that the 
Divine Natural came into being from the Divine Good of the Rational as the father and from Divine Truth there as the mother. While the Divine Natural does not as yet exist the Truth of the Rational 
is called 'barren', here 'a barren wife'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In man's case the situation is that while he is being regenerated the Lord instills good, that is, goodwill to the neighbour, into his rational. This goodwill 
or good has truth from the natural man allied to it. Once this is completed his natural has still to be regenerated, as anyone may recognize from the fact that the internal or rational man often 
conflicts with the external or natural; and as long as conflict exists the natural is not regenerate. And while the natural remains unregenerate the rational as regards truth is barren. As is the case 
in general so it is similarly in every particular instance in which the rational does not agree with the natural; in every such instance the rational as regards truth is called barren. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The 
work of regeneration revolves for the most part around making the natural man correspond to the rational man, not only in general but also in particular. And the natural man is brought into such correspondence 
by the Lord by means of the rational. That is to say, good is instilled into the rational, and within this good as the soil truths are planted, after which by means of rational truths the natural 
is brought into obedience. When it is obedient it in that case corresponds; and to the extent it corresponds a person has been regenerated. </p>

`Propter mulierem, quod sterilis ea': quod significet quod nondum Divinum Naturale, constat ex significatione `mulieris' quod sit Divinum Verum conjunctum Divino Bono Rationalis, quod Verum repraesentari 
per `Rebeccam' in capite praecedente ostensum est; et (c)a significatione `sterilis' quod nondum Divinum Naturale; se enim hoc ita habet: Divinum Naturale exstiterat ex Divino Bono Rationalis, ut 
a patre, et a Divino Vero ibi, ut a matre; cum nondum Divinum Naturale, tunc dicitur Verum Rationalis sterile, hic `mulier sterilis.' [2] Apud hominem ita est: cum is regeneratur, tunc a Domino insinuatur 
rationali ejus bonum, hoc est, velle bene proximo; huic velle seu bono adjungitur verum e naturali {1}homine; hoc facto, nondum regeneratum est {1}naturale, quod {2}sciri potest ex eo quod saepe 
internus seu rationalis homo pugnet cum externo seu naturali, et quamdiu pugna est, naturale non est regeneratum; et cum hoc non regeneratum est, est rationale quoad verum sterile; ita in communi, similiter 
in omni particulari in quo rationale dissentit a naturali, dicitur in eo particulari rationale quoad verum sterile: [3] opus regenerationis in eo maxime versatur ut rationali homini naturalis 
correspondeat, non solum in communi, sed etiam in particulari, et naturalis homo redigitur in correspondentiam a Domino per rationale, quod nempe rationali bonum {3}insinuetur, et huic bono sicut humo 
vera {4}implantentur, et dein per vera rationalia redigatur naturale ad oboedientiam, et cum oboedit, tunc correspondet; (c)et quantum correspondet, tantum regeneratus est homo. @1 i ejus$  @2 percipitur$
