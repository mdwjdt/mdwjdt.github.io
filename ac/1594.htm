<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1594节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1594.</strong>“他们，就是人与他的兄弟便分离了”表那些导致分离的事物。这从刚才所述可推知。前面（13:8）已说明“人，兄弟”的含义，即它表示结合，故“人与兄弟分离”表分离。人并不知道是什么将外在人与内在人割裂开，其原因有很多：部分是由于他不知道，或即便被告知也不相信内在人的存在；部分则由于他不知道，或即便被告知也不相信是我欲及其欲望造成这种分裂，还有物欲及其欲望，只是不及我欲那么严重。<br />人不知道，或即便被告知也不相信内在人的存在，是因为他就生活在肉体和感官事物中，而这些事物无法看到内层事物。内层事物能看到外层事物，但外层事物却无法看到内层事物。以视觉为例：内在视觉能明白何为外在视觉，而外在视觉却不明白何为内在视觉。再如，理解力和理性能理解何为记忆知识及其性质，反之则不行。人不知道或不相信内在人存在的另一个原因是，他不相信灵在肉体死亡后会脱离肉体存在，甚至不相信被称之为灵魂的内在生命的存在。当心思沉浸在肉体和感官事物中的人思及脱离肉体的灵时，他认为这是不可能的事，因为他将肉体视为生命的居所，并通过以下事实确信这一观点，即动物也有生命，然而死后却没有继续活着，此外还有很多其它事。所有这一切都起因于他生活在肉体和感官事物中，这种生活就其本身而言，与动物的生活差不多。唯一区别在于，人能思考并推理他所遇到的任何事；但他甚至不去反思这种动物所不具备的能力。<br />然而，这并非割裂外在人与内在人的主要因素，因为绝多数人都处于这种不信中，最有学问的人比简单人更甚。造成这种分裂的，主要是我欲，还有物欲，但物欲不及我欲那么严重。人不知道这一点的原因在于，他的生活缺乏仁爱，当其生活缺乏仁爱时，他怎能看到我欲及其欲望的生活如此违背天堂之爱呢？我欲及其欲望里面还有一种火花，由此而来的快乐感觉如此感染人的生命，以致他几乎认定永恒的幸福仅在于此。由于这个原因，很多人以为永恒的幸福意味着肉身生活结束后会成为大的，被其他人伺候，甚至被天使伺候，而他们自己却不愿伺候任何人，除非为了自我的缘故，这自我里面就隐藏着服侍他们自己的动机。在这种时候，他们会声称他们只愿服侍主，但这是一个谎言，因为被我欲主导的人甚至想要主也服侍他们。他们越是未做到这一点就退去，其内心想成为领主并统治整个宇宙的欲望就越强烈。不难想象，当绝大多数人，甚至所有人都变成这个样子时，这将是什么样的政府。它岂不是地狱的政府？其中每个人都爱己胜过别人。这就是隐藏在我欲里面的东西。由此可见我欲的性质，我们还可从以下事实看出，它里面隐藏着对所有不象奴隶那样顺服他们之人的仇恨。它既隐含仇恨，必也隐含报复、残忍、欺骗，以及其它罪恶。<br />唯独相爱是天堂的，相爱在于不仅说，而且还承认并相信他完全不配，是粗鄙污秽的东西，主以其无限怜悯不断引离并拦阻这人奔向他奋力闯入，甚至渴望投入其中的地狱。他承认并相信这一点，是因为这是千真万确的事实。主或天使想要他承认并相信这一点，不是为了使他顺服，而是为了防止他高估自己，因为他本来就是这样。这就象明明是排泄物，却视自己为精金，明明是粪堆上的苍蝇，却自称是天堂鸟。因此，人越承认并相信自己本来的模样，就越会远离我欲及其欲望，并憎恶自己。他越是这样做，就越从主接受天堂之爱，即相爱，这爱就在于渴望服侍所有人。所谓“最小的”就是指这些人，他们在主的国里会成为最大的（参看马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太20.26.htm">20:26</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太20.28.htm">28</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路9.46.htm">9:46</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路9.48.htm">48</a>）。<br />综上所述，我们可以看出割裂外在人与内在人的，主要是我欲；而联结外在人与内在人的，主要是相爱。若我欲不退离，这种爱永远不可能获得，因为它们彼此完全对立。内在人无非是相爱。人的灵本身或灵魂是死后活着的内层人（the interior man）。它是有组织的，因为只要人活在世上，它就与肉体结合。这内层人（即他的灵魂或灵）并非内在人（the internal man），但当它里面有相爱时，这内在人便在这内层人里面。属内在人的事物是主的，以至于可以说内在人就是主。但由于只要天使或人活在仁爱中，主就会赐给他天堂般的自我，以致他只感觉他凭自己行善，所以内在人被归于人，仿佛是他自己的。不过，凡处于相爱的人都承认并相信一切善与真都不是他的，而是主的。他承认并相信他能爱人如己（若他象天使，则会爱人胜己）是主的恩赐；他越不承认这恩赐是主的，就越远离这恩赐及其幸福。</p><br />

Cooper(2008,2013)</b></p>
<p><strong>[NCE]1594.</strong> It follows from this that they separated, a man from his brother, means that those things separate. It was said above at verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1594/bible_king-james-version_genesis_13_8" target=_top>8</a> what a man who is a brother is, namely, unity [搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1594/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1578" target=_top>1578</a>]. So separating themselves, a man from his brother, is division.<br />People do not know what divides the outer self from the inner, and the reasons are many. One is that they do not realize (or if they have heard, do not believe) that any inner self exists. Another is that they do not realize (or if they have heard, do not believe) that self-love and its desires are what divide; so do materialism and its desires, although not as much as self-love.<br />[2] The reason they do not realize (and if they have heard, do not believe) that any inner self exists is that they live enmeshed in their body and senses, which can never glimpse anything deeper. Inner qualities can see what is more superficial, but superficial qualities can never see what is deeper. Take sight as an example. Our inner eye can see what our outer eye sees, but our outer eye could never see what our inner eye does. Again, true understanding and rationality can perceive the existence and nature of bare facts, but the reverse is not true.<br />Another reason is that they do not believe in a spirit that separates from the body when people die. They barely believe in any inner life at all, which they call the soul. When people who focus on their senses and body think about the separation of the spirit from the body, it strikes them as impossible, because they locate life in the body. They confirm themselves in this view by the argument that brute animals too are alive and yet do not live on after death, and by many other arguments as well. They adopt all these attitudes because they live enmeshed in their body and senses, and this kind of life, regarded in itself, is almost exactly the same as the life of brute animals. The only difference is that people are capable of thinking and of reasoning about subjects that come up; and yet they do not then reflect on this advantage they have over animals.<br />[3] But this is not the main factor dividing the outer self from the inner, because most people succumb to such disbelief 钬?the best-educated more than the simple.<br />The chief divisive factor is self-love; materialism too, but not so much as self-love. The reason people are unaware of this is that they live lives devoid of neighborly love, and when they do, they are incapable of seeing that a life of self-love and self-centered cravings is as contrary to heavenly love as it is. In addition, self-love and its cravings then harbor a burning flame that yields pleasure, which touches their life so powerfully that they can scarcely believe it does not constitute eternal happiness itself. As a result, many of them also consider eternal happiness to consist in becoming influential after the life of the body ends, and being waited on by others, even by angels. This despite the fact that they have no interest themselves in serving anyone, unless for the ulterior, selfish motive of having others serve them. They say at the time that they want to serve only the Lord, but this is a lie, because people motivated by self-love want even the Lord to serve them, and the less it happens, the further they withdraw. In their heart, then, they carry the desire to become the Lord themselves and to rule the whole universe. Since most 钬?or rather all 钬?people are like this, you can imagine what kind of reign that would be! Would it not be the government of hell, where each person loves herself or himself more than any other? Such is the inherent character of self-love. All this evidence reveals the nature of self-love. So does the fact that self-love conceals within itself hatred against anyone who does not submit to us as a slave, and that because it conceals hatred, it also conceals vengefulness, cruelty, deceit, and many other unspeakable evils.<br />[4] Mutual love, however 钬?which is the only heavenly love 钬?consists in not merely saying but admitting and believing that we ourselves are extremely unworthy; that we are vile, disgusting creatures whom the Lord in his infinite mercy is always withdrawing and withholding from hell, although we are always attempting and even begging to throw ourselves headlong into it. The reason we need to admit and believe this is that it is true. We are asked to admit and believe it not because the Lord or any angel wants us to surrender; the aim is to prevent us from puffing up with pride despite the fact that we are like this. It would be like hearing dung claim to be pure gold, or a fly in an outhouse claim to be a bird of paradise. So the more we admit and believe that we are what we are, the more we back away from self-love and self-centered desires and shudder at ourselves. The more we do this, the more we receive heavenly love from the Lord 钬?that is, mutual love, which is the desire to serve everyone. These are the people meant by the least who become the greatest in the Lord's kingdom (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1594/bible_king-james-version_matthew_20_26-27" target=_top>Matthew 20:26-27</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1594/bible_king-james-version_matthew_20_28" target=_top>28</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1594/bible_king-james-version_luke_9_46" target=_top>Luke 9:46</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1594/bible_king-james-version_luke_9_47" target=_top>47</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1594/bible_king-james-version_luke_9_48" target=_top>48</a>).<br />[5] This evidence shows what the chief means of dividing the outer self from the inner is: self-love. It also shows that the chief means of uniting the outer self to the inner is mutual love, which is absolutely impossible to acquire until self-love withdraws. The two are, after all, diametrically opposed.<br />Our inner self is simply mutual love. Our actual spirit, or soul, is our intermediate self, which lives on after death. It is organic,{*1} since it is linked to our body while we live in the world. This intermediate self, this soul or spirit of ours, is not our inner self, but the inner self is present within it when mutual love is present.{*2} The qualities of the inner self are the Lord's, so that our inner self can be said to be the Lord. But as long as angels, or human beings, live a life of mutual love, the Lord gives them a heavenly sense of autonomy, so that for all they can tell they are doing good on their own. As a consequence, the inner self is attributed to them as if it was theirs. However, those who love one another admit and believe that no goodness or truth is theirs but that all of it is the Lord's. The ability to love another as themselves (and more especially to love another more than themselves, if they resemble angels) is a gift from the Lord, as they also admit and believe. This gift and its blessings retreat from their grasp the more they retreat from acknowledging that it is the Lord's.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} On the meaning of "organic," see note 1 in 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1594/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1378" target=_top>1378</a>.

And they were separated, a man from his brother. That this signifies that those things cause the separation, follows from what has been said. What "a man, a brother" signifies was stated above at verse 
8, namely, union; and therefore "to be separated, a man from his brother," signifies disunion. What disunites the external man from the internal, man knows not, and this for many reasons. It is partly 
owing to his not knowing, or if told, to his not believing, that there is any internal man; and partly to his not knowing, or if told, to his not believing, that the love of self and its cupidities 
are what cause the disunion; and also the love of the world and its cupidities, but not so much as the love of self.  
 </p>
<p>[2] The reason why man does not know, and if told, does not believe, that there 
is an internal man, is that he lives in corporeal and sensuous things, which cannot possibly see what is interior. Interior things can see what is exterior, but never exterior things what is interior. 
Take the case of sight: the internal sight can see what the external sight is; but the external sight cannot see what the internal sight is; or again, the intellectual and the rational can perceive what 
the faculty of memory-knowledge is, but not the reverse. A further cause is that man does not believe that there is a spirit which is separated from the body at death; and scarcely that there is an 
internal life which is called the soul; for when the sensuous and corporeal man thinks about the separation of the spirit from the body, it strikes him as an impossible thing, because he places life 
in the body, and confirms himself in this idea from the fact that brute animals also live, but still do not live after death; besides many other things. All this is a consequence of his living in corporeal 
and sensuous things; which kind of life, viewed in itself, scarcely differs from the life of brute animals, with the single exception that a man has ability to think and reason about the things 
he meets with; but upon this faculty, which brute animals have not, he does not then reflect.  
 </p>
<p>[3] This cause, however, is not what most disunites the external man from the internal, for a very great 
part of mankind are in such unbelief, and the most learned more than the simple. But what disunites is principally the love of self; the love of the world, also, but not so much as the love of self. 
The reason why man does not know this is that he lives in no charity, and when he is living in no charity it cannot be apparent to him that a life of the love of self and its cupidities is so contrary 
to heavenly love. There is also in the love of self and its cupidities something glowing, and consequently delightful, which so affects the life that the man hardly knows otherwise than that therein 
consists eternal happiness itself; and therefore many place eternal happiness in becoming great after the life of the body, and in being served by others, even by angels; while they themselves desire 
to serve no one, except for the sake of self, with a hidden view to being served themselves. Their saying that they desire to serve the Lord alone is false, for they who are in the love of self desire 
to have even the Lord serve them, and so far as this is not done they fall back. Thus they carry in their heart the desire to become lords themselves, and to reign over the universe. It is easy to conceive 
what kind of government this would be, when many, nay, when all, were like this. Is not that government infernal in which everyone loves himself more than any other? This lies hidden in the love 
of self. From this we can see the nature of the love of self, and we can see it also from the fact that there is concealed within it hatred against all who do not subject themselves to it as slaves; 
and because there is hatred, there are also revenge, cruelties, deceits, and many other wicked things. 
 </p>
<p>[4] But mutual love, which alone is heavenly, consists in a man's not only saying of himself, 
but acknowledging and believing, that he is utterly unworthy, and that he is something vile and filthy, which the Lord from His infinite mercy continually withdraws and holds back from hell, into which 
the man continually strives, nay longs, to precipitate himself. His acknowledging and believing this, is because it is true; not that the Lord, or any angel, desires him to acknowledge and believe it 
for the sake of his submission; but that he may not exalt himself, seeing that he is even such; for this would be as if excrement should call itself pure gold, or a fly of the dunghill should say that 
it is a bird of paradise. So far therefore as a man acknowledges and believes himself to be such as he really is, he recedes from the love of self and its cupidities, and abhors himself. So far as 
he does this, he receives heavenly love from the Lord, that is, mutual love, which consists in the desire to serve all. These are they who are meant by "the least," who become in the Lord's kingdom the 
greatest (see Matt. 20:26-28; Luke 9:46-48).  
 </p>
<p>[5] From what has been said we can see that what principally disjoins the external man from the internal is the love of self; and that what principally 
unites them is mutual love, which love is never possible until the love of self recedes, for these are altogether contrary to each other. The internal man is nothing else than mutual love. Man's very 
spirit or soul is the interior man that lives after death; and it is organic, for it is adjoined to the body while the man is living in this world. This interior man, that is, the soul or spirit, is 
not the internal man; but the internal man is in it when mutual love is in it. The things that are of the internal man are the Lord's; so that it may be said that the internal man is the Lord. But because 
to an angel or a man while he lives in mutual love, the Lord gives a heavenly Own, so that it appears no otherwise than that he does what is good of himself, the internal man is predicated of man, 
as if it were his. But he who is in mutual love acknowledges and believes that all that is good and true is not his, but the Lord's; and his ability to love another as himself-and what is more, if he 
is like the angels, his ability to love another more than himself-he acknowledges and believes to be the Lord's gift; from which gift and its happiness he recedes, so far as he recedes from the acknowledgment 
that it is the Lord's. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1594</b></p><p><b>1594.</b>
That 'they were separated, man from his brother' means that those things bring the separation about follows from what has just been stated. What 'a man, a brother' is has already been stated above at 
verse 8, namely unity, and therefore 'being separated, man from brother' means severance. What it is that severs the external man from the internal, the individual does not know; and there are a number 
of reasons for his not knowing. For one thing he does not know of - or if he has heard of, does not believe in - the existence of the internal man. And for another thing he does not know - or if he 
has heard, does not believe - that self-love and its desires are what cause the severance, also the love of the world and its desires, though not so much as self-love. </p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The reason he does not know 
of - or if he has heard of, does not believe in - the existence of the internal man is that the life he leads is immersed in things of the body and the senses, which cannot possibly see what is interior. 
Interior things are able to see that which is exterior, but exterior things cannot possibly see what is interior. Take the power of sight; the internal sight can see what external sight is, but external 
sight cannot possibly see what internal sight is. Or take the power of understanding and of rationality; this is able to perceive what factual knowledge is, and the nature of it, but not vice 
versa. A further reason why the existence of the internal man is not known or believed in by the individual is that he does not believe in the existence of the spirit which is separated from the body 
at death, and scarcely in the existence of that internal life which people call the soul. For when the person whose mind is immersed in things of the body and the senses thinks of the spirit being separated 
from the body it strikes him as an impossibility because he regards the body as the place where life resides, and confirms himself in this view from the fact that animals have life as well and 
yet do not live on after death, in addition to many other considerations. All these ideas of his arise from the fact that the life he leads is immersed in things of the body and the senses, a life which 
regarded in itself is little different from the life of animals. The only difference is that man is able to think and to reason about whatever he encounters; but even then he does not reflect on this 
ability which places him above animals. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 But this is not the major cause of the severance of the external man from the internal man, for the greater number of people possess such unbelief, the 
highly learned more than the simple That which causes the severance is chiefly self-love, and also love of the world, though not so much as self-love does. The reason a person does not know this is 
that his life is devoid of charity, and when his life is devoid of charity, how can he see that the life of self-love and its desires is so contrary to heavenly love? Also there is within self-love and 
its desires a kind of flame, and from it a feeling of delight which so affect a person's life that he can scarcely conceive of eternal happiness consisting of anything else. For this reason also many 
people suppose that eternal happiness means becoming great following the life of the body and being served by others, even by angels, while they themselves are not willing to serve anybody except for 
the concealed motive of being served themselves. When at such times they assert that they wish to serve the Lord alone, it is a lie, for people who are ruled by self-love wish that even the Lord should 
serve them. And to the extent this does not happen they depart, so strong is the desire in their hearts to become lords and rule the entire universe. What kind of government it would be when the majority, 
or indeed all, are like this, anyone can think out for himself. Would it not be a government like that exercised in hell where everyone loves himself more than anybody else? This is what lies 
hidden within self-love From this it may become clear what the nature of self-love is, and also from the fact that it conceals within itself hatred of all who do not submit themselves to it as its slaves. 
And because it conceals hatred, it also conceals forms of revenge, cruelty, deceit, and further unspeakable things. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 Mutual love however, which alone is heavenly, consists in not only saying 
but also acknowledging and believing that one is utterly undeserving, and something worthless and filthy, which the Lord in His infinite mercy is constantly drawing away and holding back from the hell 
into which the person constantly tries, and indeed longs, to cast himself. He acknowledges and believes this because it is the truth. Not that the Lord or any angel wishes him to acknowledge and believe 
it just to gain his submission, but to prevent his vaunting himself when he is in fact such. This would be like excrement calling itself pure gold, or a dung-fly a bird of paradise. To the extent 
therefore that a person acknowledges and believes that he really is what he in fact is, he departs from self-love and its desires, and loathes himself. To the extent that this happens he receives from 
the Lord heavenly love, that is, mutual love, which is willing to serve all. These are the people meant by the least who become the greatest in the Lord's kingdom, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2020:26-28&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 20:26-28</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%209:46-48&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 9:46-48</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
These considerations show what it is that severs the external man from the internal - chiefly self- love. And the chief thing that unites the external man to the internal is mutual love, which is 
in no way attainable until self-love departs, for they are complete opposites. The internal man is nothing else than mutual love. The human spirit itself, or soul, is the interior man which lives after 
death. It is organic, for it is joined to the body so long as the person lives in the world. This interior man - that is, his soul or spirit - is not the internal man, but the internal man is within 
the interior when the latter has mutual love within it. The things that belong to the internal man are the Lord's, so that one may say that the internal man is the Lord. Yet because the Lord grants 
an angel or man, so long as his life has mutual love in it, a heavenly proprium so that he has no idea but that he does good from himself, an internal man is therefore attributed to a person as though 
it were his own. The person in whom mutual love dwells however acknowledges and believes that everything good and true is not his own but the Lord's He acknowledges and believes that his ability to love 
another as himself- and if he is like the angels, more than himself- is a gift from the Lord and that he ceases to enjoy that gift and its happiness to the extent he departs from acknowledging that 
it is the Lord's </p>

Quod 'separabantur vir a fratre': significet quod illa separent, sequitur inde: quid 'vir frater,' dictum est supra ad vers. 8, nempe quod sit unio, quare 'separari vir a fratre' est disunio.  Quid

quia in corporeis et sensualibus vivit, quae nusquam videre possunt quid interius est; interiora possunt videre quod exterius, sed nusquam exteriora quod interius; sicut visus, visus internus videre 
potest quid visus externus; nusquam visus externus quid visus internus; aut, intellectuale et rationale potest percipere quid et quale est scientificum, non autem vicissim; tum ex eo quod non credat

quia ponit vitam in corpore seque confirmat ex eo quod etiam bruta animalia vivant, et usque non vivunt post mortem, praeter plura alia; haec omnia ex causa quia in corporeis et sensualibus vivit, 
quae vita in se spectata vix aliud est quam vita brutorum animalium, cum sola differentia quod homo cogitare possit et de rebus obviis ratiocinari, super quam facultatem prae brutis animalibus nec

ipsa felicitas aeterna in eo consistat, quare etiam plures ponunt felicitatem aeternam in eo ut post vitam corporis magni fiant, et serviantur ab aliis etiam ab angelis, cum ii nulli servire velint nisi 
ob causam occultam propter se ut serviantur; quod dicant se servire tunc velle Domino soli, hoc falsum est; nam qui in amore sui sunt, volunt ut etiam Dominus illis serviat, et quantum non fit, recedunt, 
ita in corde suo ferunt quod ipsi domini velint fieri et regnare super universum; quale regimen hoc foret, cum plures tales sunt, immo cum omnes, quisque cogitare potest.  Annon regimen infernale 
ubi unusquisque se amat prae alio?  hoc latet in amore sui; inde constare potest qualis est amor sui, etiam ex eo quod recondat in se odium contra omnes qui se non subjiciunt ei ut servos, et quia 
odium, etiam vindictas, crudelitates, dolos, et plura nefanda.  [4] Amor autem mutuus qui solus caelestis, in eo consistit quod se non solum dicat, sed agnoscat et credat; quod indignissimus sit, et 
quod vile quoddam et spurcum, quod Dominus ex Infinita Misericordia continue ab inferno in quod continue se praecipitare conatur, immo cupit, subtrahat et detineat; quod agnoscet et credet, est quia verum 
est; non quod Dominus nec aliquis angelus, velit ut id agnoscat et credat ob causam ut se submittat; sed ne efferat se cum usque talis, sicut quod excrementum diceret quod sit purum aurum; aut musca 
latrinae quod sit avis paradisiaca; quantum itaque homo agnoscit et credit quod sit talis qualis est, tantum recedit ab amore sui et ejus cupiditatibus, et tantum se abhorret; quantum hoc fit, tantum 
a Domino accipit amorem caelestem, hoc est, amorem mutuum, qui est ut omnibus servire velit; hi sunt qui intelliguntur per 'minimos, qui in regno Domini fiunt maximi,' Matth. xx 26-28; Luc. ix 46-48. 
 [5] Ex his constare potest quid disjungit externum hominem ab interno, nempe quod principaliter amor sui; et quod principaliter unit externum hominem interno, est amor mutuus, qui nusquam dabilis 
est priusquam amor sui recedit; nam prorsus contrarii sunt.  Internus homo nihil aliud est quam amor mutuus; ipse hominis spiritus seu anima est homo interior qui vivit post mortem; estque organicus, 
nam adjunctus est corpori cum homo vivit in mundo; homo hic interior, seu anima ejus aut spiritus, non est internus homo, sed internus homo est in illo, cum in illo amor mutuus; quae sunt interni hominis, 
sunt Domini, sic ut dici queat quod internus hominis sit Dominus; sed quia Dominus dat angelo seu homini dum vivit in amore mutuo, proprium caeleste, sic ut ei non appareat aliter quam quod is faciat 
bonum a se, inde internus homo praedicatur de homine sicut ejus foret; sed qui in amore mutuo est, is agnoscit et credit quod omne bonum et verum non ejus sit, sed Domini; et quod amare possit alium 
sicut se, et magis, si sicut angeli, quod amare possit alium plus quam se, quod sit donum Domini, a quo dono et ejus felici tantum recedit, quantum ab agnitione quod Domini sit. </p>
