<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3408节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3408.</strong>“他拥有羊群，拥有牛群”表就内层良善和外层良善而言，也就是就理性良善和属世良善而言。这从“羊群”和“牛群”的含义清楚可知：“羊群”是指内层良善或理性良善（<a href="343.htm">343</a>，<a href="2566.htm">2566</a>节） ；“牛群”是指外层良善或属世良善（<a href="2566.htm">2566</a>节）。“牛群”所表示的属世良善并非人生来所具有的良善，而是他通过与良善情感相联结的真理认知所获得的良善。人生来所具有的属世良善本身纯粹是某种动物式的东西，因为它也存在于动物身上。但所获得，或主赋予人的属世良善含有属灵之物在里面，因此它是属世良善里面的属灵良善。这种良善才是真正的人类属世良善，而人生来所具有的那种，尽管看似良善，但仍不是良善，甚至可能是邪恶，因为它还能接受虚假，视恶为善。这种属世良善存在于具有最坏的生活和信仰的民族当中。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3408</b></p><p><b>3408.</b>
And he had acquisition of flock, and acquisition of herd. That this signifies in respect to interior good and to exterior good (that is, to rational good and to natural good) is evident from the signification 
of "flock," as being interior or rational good (n. 343, 2566); and from the signification of "herd," as being exterior or natural good (n. 2566). The natural good which is signified by "herd," 
is not that which is born with man, but is that which is procured by means of the knowledges of truth joined to the affection of good; for the natural good born with men is in itself a mere animal 
affair, for it exists also with animals; but the natural good which is acquired, or which is given to man by the Lord, contains in it what is spiritual, so that it is spiritual good in natural. This good 
is real natural human good, while that which is born with men, although it appears as good, may still not be good, and may even be evil; for it may receive falsities, and believe that to be good which 
is evil. Such natural good exists among nations of the worst life and faith. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3408</b></p><p><b>3408.</b>
'And he had acquired flocks, and had acquired herds' means as regards interior good and as regards exterior good, that is, as regards rational good and as regards natural good. This is clear from the 
meaning of 'a flock' as interior or rational good, dealt with in <a href="343.htm">343</a>, <a href="2566.htm">2566</a>, and from the meaning of 'a herd' as exterior or natural good, dealt with in <a href="2566.htm">2566</a>. The natural good meant by 'a herd' is not 
the good that a person is born with but that which he acquires by means of cognitions of truth that are linked to an affection for good. The natural good that a person is born with is in itself no more 
than something animal-like, for it also exists with living creatures. But the natural good that is acquired, or that the Lord confers on a person, holds that which is spiritual within it, so that it 
is spiritual good within natural. This kind of good is human natural good itself, whereas the other kind - that which one is born with - notwithstanding its seeming to be good, is not necessarily good. 
Indeed it may be evil, for it is able to receive falsities too into itself and to believe that what is evil is good. Such natural good exists with nations who in life and faith are the most wicked of all. </p>

</p><b>3408.</b>
`Et fuit ei acquisitio gregis et acquisitio armenti': quod sit quoad bonum interius et quoad bonum exterius, hoc est, quoad bonum rationale et quoad bonum naturale, constat a significatione `gregis' 
quod sit bonum interius seu rationale, de qua n. 343, 2566; et a significatione `armenti' quod sit bonum exterius seu naturale, de qua n. 2566. Bonum naturale, quod per `armentum' significatur, non est 
illud quod homini connascitur, sed quod comparatur per cognitiones veri junctas affectioni boni; bonum enim naturale quod connascitur, in se non {1}est nisi quam animale quoddam, nam apud animalia 
quoque datur; at bonum naturale quod comparatur, seu quod donatur homini a Domino, in se habet spirituale, sic ut sit bonum spirituale in naturali; hoc bonum est ipsum bonum naturale humanum, at alterum, 
nempe quod connascitur, tametsi apparet ut bonum, usque potest esse non bonum, quin immo malum, nam id recipere potest etiam falsa, et credere bonum esse quod malum; tale bonum naturale datur {2}apud 
gentes pessimae vitae et fidei. @1 after quoddam$  @2 in gentibus$  </p>
