<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4543节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4543.</strong>“雅各就对他家人，并一切与他同在的人说”表在诸如此时所存在的那种属世良善里面的整理。这从“对他家人，并一切与他同在的人说”的含义，以及“雅各”的代表清楚可知：“对他家人，并一切与他同在的人说”是指整理；“雅各”在此是指属世良善（参看<a href="4538.htm">4538</a>节）。“对他家人，并一切与他同在的人说”之所以表示整理，是因为就内义而言，下文所论述的主题就是良善对真理的整理。因为当前面（<a href="4538.htm">4538</a>节）所描述的属灵良善开始在属世心智中起主导作用时，它就会把那里的真理整理成序。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4543</b></p><p><b>4543.</b>
And Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him. That this signifies disposition by natural good, such as there was then, is evident from the signification of "saying to his household 
and to all that were with him," as being disposition; and from the representation of Jacob, as here being natural good (see above, n. 4538). The reason why "saying to his household and to all that were 
with him" denotes disposition, is that in what now follows the subject treated of in the internal sense is the disposition of truths by good. For when spiritual good (described above, n. 4538) begins 
to act the first part in the natural mind, it then disposes into order the truths which are there. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4543</b></p><p><b>4543.</b>
'And Jacob said to his household, and to all who were with him' means the arrangement within the kind of natural good that existed at that point. This is clear from the meaning of 'saying to his household, 
and to all who were with him' as arrangement, and from the representation of 'Jacob' here as natural good, dealt with above in <a href="4538.htm">4538</a>. The reason 'saying to his household, and to all who were with 
him' means arrangement is that in what follows next the subject in the internal sense is the arrangement of truths by good; for when spiritual good, dealt with above in <a href="4538.htm">4538</a>, starts to play the leading 
role in the natural mind it arranges into order the truths that are there. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 4543</b>
</p><b>4543.</b>
`Et dixit Jacob ad domum suam, et ad omnes qui cum illo': </p>
<p>quod significet dispositionem a bono naturali quali tunc, constat a significatione `dicere ad domum suam, et ad omnes qui cum illo' quod sit 
dispositio; et a repraesentatione `Jacobi' quod hic sit bonum naturale, de qua supra n. 4538; quod `dicere ad domum suam et ad omnes qui cum illo' sit dispositio, est inde quia in nunc sequentibus 
in sensu interno agitur de dispositione verorum a bono; </p>
<p>cum enim bonum spirituale, de quo supra n. 4538, in mente naturali primas agere incipit, tunc disponit vera quae ibi, in ordinem. </p>
