<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4247节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4247.</strong>“使者回到雅各那里说，我们到了你哥哥以扫那里，他也正来迎接你”表良善不断流入，以便将它们，也就是真理变成它自己的。这从“哥哥（即弟兄）”和“来迎接”的含义清楚可知：“哥哥（即弟兄）”，就是此处的以扫，是指良善，也就是说，是指主的神性属世层的良善，如前所述；“来迎接”是指流注，如下文所述。由于所指的是流注，故所指的也是变成它自己的。<br />从前面数次关于该主题的阐述可以看出，良善与真理，良善进入真理的流注，以及良善将真理变成自己的是何情形。也就是说，由此可以看出，良善不断流入，真理接受良善，因为真理是良善的器皿。除了纯正的真理外，神性良善无法置于任何其它器皿中，因为良善与真理彼此对应、相互匹配。当人处于对真理的情感（每个人在重生之前最开始的阶段，都是先处于对真理的情感）时，良善就不断流入，只是还没有器皿，也就是没有放置它自己、将其变成自己的那种真理；因为重生之初，人还未拥有任何认知。然而，那时良善就不断流入，故产生了对真理的情感；对真理的情感并非来自其它源头，只来自神性良善的不断努力流入。由此明显可知，甚至在那时，良善也占据第一位，并发挥主导作用，尽管看上去似乎是真理如此行。然而，当人正在重生（重生发生在人拥有认知的成年时期）时，良善就会显现；因为这时，此人更多地处于对行出真理的情感，不再那么处于对知道真理的情感。在此之前，真理一直处于他的理解或认知，但现在处于他的意愿；当它处于意愿时，就在此人里面了，因为意愿构成这个人自己。存在于人里面的反复循环是这样：一切事实、一切知识皆通过视觉或听觉被引入思维，由此被引入意愿，再由意愿通过思维被引入行为。从记忆，也可以说从内视或内眼开始的类似循环也是存在的，即：从内视开始通过思维进入意愿，从意愿通过思维进入行为；或若出现某种障碍，则进入行为的努力；一旦这种障碍被清除，那么这种努力就会付诸实践。<br />由此明显可知良善以哪种方式流入真理，并使之变成自己的。也就是说，首先，属于信的一切真理通过听觉或视觉被引入，然后被储存在记忆中，由此被接连提升到人的思维过程，最终被引入他的意愿。一旦在意愿中，它们就从那里通过思维进入行为，或它们若不能进入行为，就留在努力中。这种努力本身就是一种内在行为，因为一旦有机会，它就会变成一种外在行为。然而，要知道，尽管这种循环是存在的，但产生这种循环的却是良善。因为出自主的生命只流入和流经良善，并且通过至内在的事物如此行。谁都能看出，通过至内在事物流入的生命产生这循环，因为没有生命，无物产生。由于出自主的生命只流入和流经良善，故可知良善就是那产生之物，并在人拥有对真理的认知，同时渴望接受它们的程度内流入真理，使其成为自己的。 </p>

And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother, to Esau, and moreover he cometh to meet thee. That this signifies that good flows in continually, so as to appropriate to itself 
(namely, truths), is evident from the signification of "brother," here Esau, as being good, (namely, that of the Lord's Divine natural, of which above); and from the signification of "coming to meet," 
as being to flow in (concerning which in what follows); and as influx is signified, so is appropriation.  [2] From what has been said several times before on this subject, it may be seen how the case 
is with good and truth, and with the influx of good into truth, and with the appropriation of truth by good, namely, that good is continually flowing in, and that truth receives it, for truths are the 
vessels of good. The Divine good cannot be applied to any other vessels than genuine truths, for they correspond to each other. When a man is in the affection of truth (in which he is in the beginning 
before he begins to be regenerated), even then good is continually flowing in, but as yet has no vessels (that is, truths) into which to apply itself (that is, to be appropriated); for in the beginning 
of regeneration man is not as yet in knowledges. At that time, however, as good is continually flowing in, it produces the affection of truth; which is from no other source than the continual endeavor 
of Divine good to flow in. From this it is evident that even at that time good is in the first place, and acts the principal part, although it appears as if it were truth that did this. But when 
a man is being regenerated (which takes place in adult age when he is in knowledges), good then manifests itself; for the man is not then so much in the affection of knowing truth, as in the affection 
of doing it. Heretofore truth had been in his understanding, but now it is in his will; and when it is in the will, it is in the man; for the will constitutes the man himself. Such is the constant 
circle in man that everything of knowledge is insinuated through the sight or through the hearing into the thought, and from this into the will, and from the will through the thought into act. Or again 
from the memory, which is like an internal eye, or internal sight, there is a similar circle-from this sight through the thought into the will, and from the will through the thought into act; or if 
anything hinders, into the endeavor to act, which, as soon as that which hindered is removed, goes forth into act.  [3] From this it is evident how the case is with influx, and with the appropriation 
of truth by good, namely, that first of all the truths of faith are insinuated through the hearing or through the sight, and are then stored up in the memory; from which they are successively elevated 
into knowledge, and at last flow into the will, and when in this they proceed thence through thought into act; and if they cannot go into act, they are in endeavor, which is itself an internal act, 
and whenever there is an opportunity this becomes an external act. Be it known, however, that while there is this circle, nevertheless it is good which produces the circle; for the life which is from 
the Lord does not flow in except into good, thus through good, and this from the inmosts. That the life which flows in through the inmosts produces this circle, may be seen by everyone, for without life 
nothing is produced; and as the life which is from the Lord does not flow in except into good and through good, it follows that good is that which produces; and that it flows into truths, and appropriates 
them to itself, insofar as the man is in the knowledges of truth, and is at the same time desirous to receive them. </p>

'The messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to your brother, to Esau, and he also is coming to meet you' means that good flows in constantly so as to make them, that is to say, truths, its own. 
This is clear from the meaning of 'brother', who in this case is Esau, as good - that is to say, the good of the Lord's Divine Natural, dealt with above; and from the meaning of 'coming to meet' as 
flowing in, dealt with below. And because flowing in is meant, making its own is meant also. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 From what has been stated several times already on these matters one may see what the situation is with 
regard to good and truth, and with the influx of good into truth, and in this connection with good making truth its own. That is to say, one may see that good flows constantly into truth, and truth 
receives good, since truths are the vessels for good. The only vessels into which Divine Good can be placed are genuine truths, for good and truth match each other. When a person is moved by the affection 
for truth, as everyone is at first prior to being regenerated, good is constantly flowing in even then, but as yet it has no vessels, that is, no truths in which to place itself or make its own; 
for nobody at the outset of regeneration possesses any cognitions as yet. But because good at that time is flowing in constantly it produces the affection for truth, for there is no origin to the affection 
for truth other than the constant endeavour of Divine good to flow in. This shows that even at that time good occupies the first position and plays the leading role, although it seems as though 
truth did so. When a person is being regenerated however, which takes place in adult years when he possesses cognitions, good reveals itself, for he is then moved not so much by the affection for knowing 
truth as for doing it. For previously truth had been in the understanding, but now it is in his will, and when in his will it is in the person's true self, since the will constitutes the person's 
true self. With man the recurrent cycle of events exists in which every fact and every bit of knowledge is introduced through sight or hearing into his thought-process, and from there into his will, 
then passing from the will through thought into action. A similar cycle also exists starting from the memory which is so to speak an inner eye or inner sight. Starting from that inner sight it passes 
through the thought-process into the will, and from the will through thought into action; or else if some obstacle stands in the way it passes into the endeavour to act, that endeavour being actualized 
the moment the obstacle is removed. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 All of this shows the way in which good flows into truth and makes it its own. That is to say, it shows that first of all truths which belong to faith are 
introduced through hearing or sight and are then stored away in the memory, from where they are raised up one after another into the person's thought- process and at length introduced into his will. 
Once in the will they pass from there through thought into action, or if they are not able to pass into action they remain in the endeavour. The very endeavour is internal action, for as often as the 
opportunity exists it is made an external action. It should be realized however that although there is this cycle of events it is nevertheless good which produces the cycle. For the life which comes from 
the Lord flows solely into good, and thus through good, doing so from things that are inmost. It may be seen by anyone that the life flowing in through the things that are inmost produces the cycle, 
for without life nothing is produced. And since the life which comes from the Lord flows only into good and through good, good is consequently that which produces and that which flows into truths and 
makes them its own, to the extent that a person possesses cognitions of truth and at the same time is a willing recipient. </p>

`Et reversi sunt nuntii ad Jacobum, dicendo, Venimus ad fratrem tuum ad Esavum, et etiam vadit obviam tibi': quod significet quod bonum continue influat ut appropriet sibi, nempe vera, constat a significatione 
`fratris,' hic Esavi, quod sit bonum, nempe Divini Naturalis Domini, de qua supra; et a significatione `venire obviam' quod sit influere, de qua sequitur; </p>
<p>et quia est influxus, est appropriatio. 
 [2] Ex illis quae prius aliquoties de his dicta sunt, constare potest quomodo se habet cum bono et vero, ac cum boni influxu in verum, et de appropriatione veri a bono, quod nempe bonum 
continue influat, et quod verum recipiat, vera enim sunt vasa boni; [2] {1} Divinum Bonum non aliis vasis applicari potest quam genuinis veris, nam sibi mutuo correspondent; cum homo in affectione 
veri est, in qua est in initio antequam regeneratur, tunc quoque continue bonum influit, sed nondum habet vasa, hoc est, vera quibus se applicet, hoc est, approprietur, nam homo in initio regenerationis 
nondum in cognitionibus est, sed tunc bonum, quia continue influit, producit {2} affectionem veri, affectio (o)enim veri non aliunde est quam a boni Divini continuo conatu influendi; inde constare 
potest quod etiam tunc bonum sit primo loco et quod principaliter agat, tametsi appareat sicut verum foret; cum autem homo regeneratur, quod fit in adulta aetate cum in cognitionibus est {3}, 
tunc bonum se manifestat, nam non tunc ita {4} in affectione sciendi verum est, sed in affectione faciendi illud; prius enim fuerat verum in intellectu, tunc autem est in voluntate, et cum in voluntate 
est, (t)in homine est; nam voluntas constituit ipsum hominem: talis {5} est circulus perennis apud hominem quod omne scientificum et omne cognitivum insinuetur {6} per visum vel per auditum 
in cogitationem et inde in voluntatem, (c)et a voluntate per cogitationem in actum; </p>
<p>vel quoque a memoria, quae est sicut oculus internus seu visus internus, ab hac similis est {7} circulus, nempe 
a visu illo per cogitationem in voluntatem, et a voluntate per cogitationem in actum, aut si quid obstat, in conatum agendi, qui ut primum id quod obstitit, removetur, prodit in actum.  [3] Ex his 
constare potest quomodo se habet cum influxu et appropriatione veri a bono, quod nempe omnium primo vera quae fidei, per auditum seu per visum insinuentur, ac tunc in memoria recondantur, et quod inde successive 
eleventur in cogitationem et tandem insinuentur {8} voluntati, in qua cum sunt, procedunt inde (o)per cogitationem in actum, et si non in actum possunt, sunt in conatu; ipse conatus 
est actus internus, nam quotiescumque datur facultas, fit ille actus externus: sed sciendum quod ille sit circulus, at {9} usque est bonum quod (t)illum circulum producit; vita enim quae a Domino, 
non influit nisi in bonum, ita per bonum, et hoc ab intimis; quod vita quae per intima influit {10}, illum circulum producat, cuivis potest constare, nam absque vita nihil producitur; et cum vita quae a 
Domino, non influit nisi in bonum et per bonum, sequitur quod bonum sit quod producit, {11} et quod influit in vera, et appropriat illa sibi, quantum homo in veri cognitionibus est, et simul 
quantum recipere vult.      @1 i et$      @2 usque bonum quod continue influit producit tunc$      @3 hoc est, cum in cognitionibus est, quod fit in ejus adulta aetate$      @4 tunc non$      @5
