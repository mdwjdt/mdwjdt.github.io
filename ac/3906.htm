<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3906节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3906.</strong>“就嫉妒她姐姐”表对它不像外在真理那样得到承认的愤慨。这从“嫉妒”和“姐姐”的含义，以及“拉结”的代表清楚可知：“嫉妒”是愤慨的表达，之所以愤慨是因为她没有像利亚那样生子；“拉结”是指内在真理（参看<a href="3905.htm">3905</a>节）；“姐姐”，就是此处的利亚，是指外在真理，因为“利亚”表外在真理（参看<a href="3793.htm">3793</a>，<a href="3819.htm">3819</a>节） 。那些正经历重生之人的经历如下：他们逐渐认识何为内在真理，但一开始并非以照之生活的那种信仰承认它。因为内在真理与属灵情感相结合，这属灵情感无法流入进来，除非外在真理预备与内在真理相对应。<br />以这一内在真理为例：一切良善皆出自主，凡源于人自我的，都不是良善。在重生之初，该真理能被知晓，却在信仰和行为上得不到承认；因为信仰和行为上的承认就是拥有对该真理的确是真理的洞察，和发自内心意愿它是真理的情感；每当良善被付诸行动时，情况就是这样。这种承认还包含这样的洞察：源于自我的良善必牵涉自我关注，因而将自我置于他人之上，因此蔑视他人，并对人所行的良善具有一种自我功德感。在内在真理与外在真理联结之前，这些缺陷就存在于外在真理中；并且在自我关注开始停止，对邻舍的关注开始被感觉到之前，这二者无法联结在一起。由此可见，对内在真理尚未像外在真理那样得到承认的愤慨是什么意思。</p>

And Rachel was zealous against her sister. That this signifies indignation that it was not acknowledged as was external truth, is evident from the signification of "being zealous," as being expressive 
of indignation, and this because she did not bear as Leah did; from the representation of Rachel, as being interior truth (see n. 3905); and from the signification of a "sister," who here is Leah, as 
being external truth. (That "Leah" is external truth, see above, n. 3793, 3819.) With those who are being regenerated the case is this: They learn to know what internal truth is, but at first do not 
acknowledge it with such faith as to live according to it. For internal truths are conjoined with spiritual affection, which cannot inflow until external truths have been adapted to correspondence with 
the internal. [2] Take for example this internal truth: All good is from the Lord, and that which is of man's own is not good. In the beginning of regeneration this may be known, but yet is not acknowledged 
in faith and also in act; for to acknowledge it in faith and in act is to have a perception that it is so, and an affection to will it to be so; and this in every act of good; and is also to 
have a perception that good from what is man's own cannot but have regard for self, and thus to the preference of self above others, and consequently a contempt for others, and moreover a feeling of 
self-merit in the good that we do. These things are within external truth before internal truth has been conjoined with it; and this cannot be conjoined until regard for self begins to cease, and regard 
for the neighbor begins to be felt. From this it is evident what is meant by "indignation that internal truth was not yet acknowledged as was external truth." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3906</b></p><p><b>3906.</b>
'And Rachel was jealous of her sister' means indignation that it was not being acknowledged as external truth was. This is clear from 'being jealous' as an expression of indignation - indignation because 
she was not bearing as Leah was; from the representation of 'Rachel' as interior truth, dealt with immediately above in <a href="3905.htm">3905</a>; and from the meaning of 'a sister', who in this case is Leah, as external 
truth - for 'Leah' means external truth, see <a href="3793.htm">3793</a>, <a href="3819.htm">3819</a>. The experience of those who are being regenerated is as follows: They come to know what internal truth is, but at first they do not acknowledge 
it with the kind of faith that results in their living according to it. For internal truths are joined to spiritual affection, and this cannot flow in until external truths are ready to correspond 
to internal truths. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Take for example the internal truth that all good comes from the Lord and that no good exists which springs from man's proprium. This truth can be known when regeneration 
begins, but it cannot as yet be acknowledged in action as well as in faith since the acknowledgement of it in faith and action involves a discernment in the mind that that truth is indeed a truth and 
a desire in the heart for it to be a truth; and this is the situation whenever good is put into action. That acknowledgement also involves the discernment that good springing from the proprium inevitably 
entails self-regard, thus putting self before others, and as a consequence contempt for others and above all thoughts of merit for the good that one does. These faults are present in external truth 
before internal truth has been joined to it, and the two cannot be joined together until self-regard starts to wane and a regard for the neighbour begins to be felt. From this one may see what is meant 
by indignation that internal truth was not yet being acknowledged as external truth was. </p>

`Et zelavit Rachel in sororem suam': quod significet indignationem quod non agnosceretur sicut externum, constat a significatione `zelare' quod sit indignationis, et quidem propter quod non pareret 
sicut Leah; (c)a repraesentatione `Rachelis' quod sit verum interius, de qua mox supra n. 3905, et ex significatione `sororis,' quae hic Leah, quod sit verum externum; quod `Leah' sit verum externum, 
videatur n. 3793, 3819.  `Ita se habet cum illis qui regenerantur; discunt scire quid verum internum, sed principio non agnoscunt id tali fide ut vivatur secundum id; vera enim interna conjuncta 
sunt affectioni spirituali, quae non influere potest priusquam externa vera ad correspondentiam cum internis sunt adaptata; sicut hoc verum internum pro exemplo, quod omne bonum sit a Domino, et 
quod non bonum sit quod a proprio hominis; [2] illud principio regenerationis sciri potest, sed usque non agnosci fide tum actu, id enim agnoscere fide et actu est perceptionem habere quod ita sit, 
et affectionem quod ita esse velit, et hoc in omni actu boni; tum perceptionem quod bonum ex proprio non possit aliter quam spectare se, ita praeferentiam sui prae aliis, consequenter contemptum 
aliorum, ac insuper meritum in bono quod {1}agit; haec insunt vero extemo antequam ei conjunctum est verum internum, {2}quae non conjungi possunt priusquam sui intuitio cessare, et intuitio proximi 
{3}sentiri incipit; exinde patere potest quid intelligitur per indignationem quod verum internum non adhuc agnosceretur sicut externum.(s) @1 facit$ @2 quod non conjungi potest$ @3 i ex amore$ </p>
