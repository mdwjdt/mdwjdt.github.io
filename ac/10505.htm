<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10505节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10505</strong>.“不然，求你从你所写的册上把我涂抹掉吧”表圣言、教会和敬拜的内在不会被毁灭。这从摩西的代表，以及“你所写的”和“从册上涂抹掉”的含义清楚可知：说这些话的摩西是指圣言、教会和敬拜的内在（对此，参看<a href="10468.htm">10468</a>节）；“你所写的”是指来自主存在于那里的东西，因为“册”表示存在于内在之物，而“写”当论及耶和华，也就是主时，是指来自主存在于那里的东西；“从册上涂抹掉”是指被毁灭，但在此不是指被毁灭，因为接下来的答复是，即“谁得罪我，我就从我的册上涂抹谁”表示除了那些背离神性的人，因而除了那些兴趣在于外在事物，不在于内在之物的人外，圣言、教会和敬拜的内在不会被毁灭。<br />耶和华的册子，在下一节被称为“我的册子”或耶和华的册子，在别处被称为“生命册”，它之所以表示内在之物，是因为人的内在居于天堂，因而在主所在的地方。因此，那些在他的内在里面的事物由主那里从天天堂而出，都是神性属天或属灵事物。它们能被人的内在接受，但不能被其与内在分离的外在接受。这是因为外在居于世界，是为了接受存在于世界上的属世事物而塑造的，没有经由内在事物而来的流注，这些属世事物就没有天上的生命，因而可以说是死的。 <br />由此可见当如何理解圣言中的“生命册”，写在这册子上的人都究竟是谁，即那些过着一种真理和良善的生命，因而出于爱和信遵守神性诫命的人。因为遵守这些诫命的生活打开并塑造内在人；写在册子上的是主所写的，存到永远。他们就是以下经文中“写在生命册上的”所指的人，但以理书：<br />那时，你的有民中，凡查到被写在册上的，必蒙搭救。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但12.1.htm">12:1</a>）<br />启示录：<br />凡得胜的，必这样穿白衣，我也必不从生命册上涂抹他的名。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启3.5.htm">3:5</a>）<br /><br />只有写在羔羊生命册上的才会进入新耶路撒冷。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.27.htm">21:27</a>）<br /><br />我看见案卷展开了，并且另有一卷展开，就是生命册。死了的人都凭着这些案卷所记载的，照他们所行的受审判。若发现有人没记在生命册上，他就被扔在火湖里。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启20.12.htm">20:12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启20.15.htm">15</a>）<br /><br />凡名字没有记在羔羊生命册上的人，都要拜这兽。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启13.8.htm">13:8</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/启17.8.htm">17:8</a>）<br />除此之外还有其它地方。<br />要知道，刻写在内在人中的一切都由主刻写的，刻写在那里的事物构成人的实际属灵和属天生命；还要知道，刻写在那里的每一个事物都刻写在他的爱上（参看<a href="2474.htm">2474</a>，<a href="8620.htm">8620</a>，<a href="9386.htm">9386</a>节）。</p>

And if not, blot me I pray out of Thy book which Thou hast written. That this signifies the internal of the Word, of the church, and of worship, that it will not perish, is evident from the representation 
of Moses, who says these things, as being the internal of the Word, of the church, and of worship (on which see n. 10468); from the signification of "which Thou hast written," as being that which 
is there from the Lord; for by the "book" is signified that which is in the internal; and by "writing," when said with respect to Jehovah, that is, the Lord, as being that which is there from the Lord; 
and from the signification of "being blotted out of it," as being to perish; but here not to perish, because it is replied "he who hath sinned against Me, him will I blot out of My book," by which 
is signified that the internal of the Word, of the church, and of worship will not perish; but that those will perish who turn themselves away from the Divine, thus who are in things external without 
what is internal.  [2] That the book which Jehovah wrote, which in the following verse is called "My book," or the book of Jehovah, and elsewhere the "book of life," denotes what is internal, is because 
the internal of man is in heaven, thus where the Lord is, and consequently those things which are in his internal are out of heaven from the Lord, all which are Divine celestial and spiritual things. 
These can be received by the internal of man, but not by his external separate from the internal, because the external is in the world, and is formed to receive the natural things which are in the 
world, and which without influx through internal things have no heavenly life, and consequently are called dead. [3] From all this it can be seen what is meant in the Word by the "book of life," and 
who they are who are said to be "written in this book," namely, those who are in the life of truth and good, thus who do the Divine commandments from love and faith. For a life according to these commandments 
opens the internal man and forms him, and what is written therein is written by the Lord, and remains to eternity. These are meant by "those who are written in the book of life," in the following 
passages: </p>
<p>     At that time Thy people shall be rescued, everyone that shall be found written in the book (Dan. 12:1).      He that overcometh shall be clothed in white garments; and I will not 
blot his name out of the book of life (Rev. 3:5).      None shall enter into the New Jerusalem, except those who are written in the Lamb's book of life (Rev. 21:27).      I saw that the books were 
opened; and another book was opened, which is the book of life, and the dead were judged out of the things which were written in the book, according to their works. And if anyone was not found written 
in the book of life, he was cast into the lake of fire (Rev. 20:12, 15).      All shall adore the beast whose names are not written in the Lamb's book of life (Rev. 13:8; 17:8); </p>
<p>besides in other 
places. [4] Be it known that all things that have been written in the internal man have been written by the Lord, and that the things there written make the very spiritual and celestial life of man; 
also that each and all things that have been written there, have been written on the love (see also n. 2474, 8620, 9386). </p>

'And if not, blot me out, I beg You, from Your book which You have written' means that the internal side of the Word, the Church, and worship will not be destroyed. This is clear from the representation 
of Moses, who says these words, as the internal side of the Word, the Church, and worship, dealt with in <a href="10468.htm">10468</a>; from the meaning of 'book which You have written' as what exists there from the Lord, 
for 'book' means that which is present in the internal, while 'writing' - when attributed to Jehovah, that is, to the Lord - means what exists there from the Lord; and from the meaning of 'blotting 
out of it' as being destroyed. But at this point not being destroyed is meant because the reply which follows - 'him who has sinned against Me I will blot out of My book' - means that the internal side 
of the Word, the Church, and worship will not be destroyed but those who turn themselves away from the Divine, thus those whose interest lies in external things and not in what is internal.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
The reason why the book written by Jehovah, which in the next verse is called 'My book' or Jehovah's book, and elsewhere 'the book of life', means what is internal is that a person's internal resides 
in heaven, thus where the Lord is. Consequently the things within his internal are derived from heaven and exist from the Lord, and all are Divine and celestial or spiritual. They are able to be received 
by the person's internal, but not by his external separated from his internal. This is because his external resides in the world and has been fashioned to receive natural things existing in the world, 
which without influx through the internal things possess no heavenly life and are therefore said to be dead.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 All this helps to show what should be understood in the Word by 'the book of life' 
and who exactly should be understood by those written in that book, namely those who lead a life of truth and good, thus who in love and faith obey Divine commandments. A life in keeping with those 
commandments opens and fashions the internal man; and what has been inscribed there has been inscribed by the Lord and remains forever. They are the ones who should be understood by 'those written 
in the book of life' in the following places: In Daniel,  </p>
<blockquote>
At that time Your people will be rescued, every one who is found written in the book. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Dan%2012:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Dan 12:1</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In John,  </p>
<blockquote>
He who conquers will be clad 
in white garments; I will not blot his name out of the book of life. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%203:5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 3:5</a>.

 It should be remembered that everything inscribed on a person's internal has been 
inscribed by the Lord; that what is inscribed there constitutes the person's actual spiritual and celestial life; and also that every single thing inscribed there has been inscribed on his love. See

`Et si non, dele me quaeso e libro Tuo quem scripsisti': quod significet internum Verbi, Ecclesiae, et cultus, non periturum, constat ex repraesentatione `Moschis' qui haec dicit, quod sit internum 
Verbi, Ecclesiae, et cultus, de qua n. 10,468, ex significatione `libri quem scripsisti' quod sit quod ibi a Domino, nam per `librum' significatur quod in interno est, et per `scribere' cum de Jehovah, 
hoc est, Domino, quod sit quod ibi a Domino; et ex significatione `delere ex illo' quod sit perire, luc autem non perire, quia respondetur {1}, `illum qui peccavit Mihi delebo e libro Meo' per quae 
significatur quod (o)non internum Verbi, Ecclesiae, et cultus, periturum, sed quod illi perituri qui se avertunt a Divino, ita qui in externis sunt absque interno {2}. 	[2] Quod liber quem scripsit Jehovah, 
qui in versu sequente `liber Meus' seu (o)liber Jehovae vocatur, et alibi `liber vitae,' sit internum, est quia internum hominis est in caelo, ita ubi Dominus, et inde quae in interno ejus sunt, 
e caelo a Domino sunt, quae omnia sunt Divina caelestia et spiritualia; haec recipi possunt ab interno (o)hominis, non autem ab externo ejus {3} separato ab interno, quoniam externum {4} est in mundo 
et formatum ad recipiendum naturalia quae in mundo, quae absque influxu per interna non caelestem vitam habent, et inde dicuntur mortua {5}. 	[3] Ex his constare potest quid in Verbo intelligitur 
per `librum vitae,' et quinam (o)sunt qui intelliguntur {6} scripti in libro illo, quod nempe qui in vita veri et boni sunt, ita qui ex amore et fide faciunt praecepta Divina, nam vita secundum praecepta 
illa aperit internum hominem ac format illum, et quod ibi inscriptum est, a Domino inscriptum est et manet in aeternum; hi sunt qui intelliguntur per `scriptos in libro vitae' in sequentibus his locis: 
apud Danielem,      	In tempore hoc eripietur populus tuus, omnis qui invenitur scriptus in libro, xii 1: </p>
<p>apud Johannem,      	Qui vicerit, is induetur vestimentis albis, non delebo nomen ejus 
e libro vitae, Apoc. iii 5: </p>
<p>apud eundem,      	Non ingrediuntur {7} in Hierosolymam novam, nisi qui scripti in libro vitae Agni, Apoc. xxi (x)27: </p>
<p>apud eundem,      	Vidi quod libri aperti (x)sint; 
et liber alius apertus est qui est vitae; et judicati sunt mortui juxta ea quae scripta sunt in libris {8} secundum opera illorum; et si quis non inventus est in libro vitae scriptus, ejectus est in 
stagnum ignis, Apoc. xx 12, 13, (x)15: </p>
<p>apud eundem,      	Adorabunt bestiam omnes, quorum non sunt scripta nomina in libro vitae Agni, Apoc. xiii 8, (o)et xvii 8; </p>
<p>praeter etiam alibi. 	[4] Sciendum 
est quod omnia quae interno homini {9} inscripta sunt, a Domino inscripta sint; et quod quae ibi inscripta faciant ipsam vitam spiritualem et caelestem hominis; tum quod omnia et singula quae ibi 
inscripta sunt, amori inscripta sint {10}; videatur etiam n. 2474, 8620, 9386. @1 sequitur, dixit Jehovah ad Moschen$ @2 illi quibus internum est occlusum$ @3 hominis$ @4 i ejus$ @5 et inde recipit
