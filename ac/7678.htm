<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7678节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7678.</strong>“摩西就向埃及地伸杖”表神之真理的能力向侵扰者的整个属世层的行使。这从“伸杖”和“埃及地”的含义，以及“摩西”的代表清楚可知：“伸杖”是指能力的行使，如前所述（<a href="7673.htm">7673</a>节）；“摩西”是指神的真理（参看<a href="6752.htm">6752</a>，<a href="7004.htm">7004</a>，<a href="7010.htm">7010</a>，<a href="7382.htm">7382</a>节）；“埃及地”是指侵扰者的属世层，如前所述（<a href="7674.htm">7674</a>节）。“摩西的手”所描述的神性能力是神之真理的能力。一切能力属于真理（参看<a href="3091.htm">3091</a>，<a href="5623.htm">5623</a>，<a href="6344.htm">6344</a>，<a href="6423.htm">6423</a>，<a href="6948.htm">6948</a>节）；事实上，从神性良善发出的神性真理具有这样的性质：它创造了宇宙万物。在约翰福音中，“道（即圣言）”表示这真理：<br />太初有道（圣言），道与神同在，道就是神。万物是藉着祂造的。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.1.htm">1:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.3.htm">3</a>）<br />这解释了为何神迹通过摩西来行，因为摩西代表神性真理。大多数人以为圣言或神性真理仅仅是耶和华所说的话和祂吩咐所要如此行的事，仅此而已。而事实上，它是本质存在本身，万物皆从它并通过它而存在并持续存在。从祂发出的本质存在，和由这本质存在所产生的万物的显现就是“神性真理”所表示的。这一点可通过天使来说明。一个仁与信的气场从天使发出，它明显能感觉得到，还产生奇妙的效果。由此可对从主的神性良善发出的神性真理形成某种概念。</p>

And Moses stretched out his rod over the land of Egypt. That this signifies the rule of the power of truth Divine over the whole natural of the infesters, is evident from the signification of "stretching 
out the rod," as being the rule of power (of which above, n. 7673); from the representation of Moses, as being truth Divine (see n. 6752, 7004, 7010, 7382); and from the signification of "the land 
of Egypt," as being the natural of the infesters (of which above, n. 7674). The Divine power which is described by "the hand of Moses" is the power of truth Divine (that all power is of truth, see n. 
3091, 5623, 6344, 6423, 6948); nay, such power has the Divine truth which proceed from the Divine good, that through it have been created all things in the universe. "The Word" signifies this truth 
in John: </p>
<p>     In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and God was the Word, all things were made by Him (John 1:1, 3); </p>
<p>and from this it is that miracles were done by Moses, for Moses 
represents Divine truth. It is believed by most people that the Word, or Divine truth, is only speech from Jehovah, and a command that it be so done, and nothing further; but it is the very Essential, 
from which and by which are all things. That being [Esse] which proceeds from Him, and consequently the coming forth [existere] of all things, is what is meant by "Divine truth." This can be illustrated 
from the angels; from whom there proceeds a sphere of charity and faith that is sensibly perceived, and that also produces wonderful effects; from which some idea can be formed of the Divine truth 
that proceeds from the Divine good of the Lord. </p>

'And Moses stretched out his rod over the land of Egypt' means exercising the power of God's truth over the entire natural of the molesting ones. This is clear from the meaning of 'stretching out the 
rod' as an exercising of power, dealt with above in <a href="7673.htm">7673</a>; from the representation of 'Moses' as God's truth, dealt with in <a href="6752.htm">6752</a>, <a href="7010.htm">7010</a>, <a href="7014.htm">7014</a>, <a href="7382.htm">7382</a>; and from the meaning of 'the land of Egypt' as the natural 
of those who molest, dealt with above in <a href="7674.htm">7674</a>. The Divine power which is described by 'the hand of Moses' is the power of God's truth. All power belongs to truth, see <a href="3091.htm">3091</a>, <a href="5623.htm">5623</a>, <a href="6344.htm">6344</a>, <a href="6423.htm">6423</a>, <a href="6948.htm">6948</a>; 
indeed the power that Divine Truth going forth from Divine Goodness possesses is such that it has created all things throughout the universe. That Truth is meant by 'the Word' in John, </p>
<blockquote>
In the beginning 
was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. All things were made through Him. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%201:1,%203&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 1:1, 3</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This explains why miracles were performed through Moses, for 'Moses' represents 
Divine Truth. Most people think that the Word or Divine Truth is merely what Jehovah has spoken and what He commands so to be done - this and nothing more. But in fact it is the Essential Being itself 
(Ipsum Essentiale), the source from which all things exist and the means by which they are kept in existence. That Essential Being (Esse) which emanates from Him and, arising from it, the Coming-into-Being 
(Existere) of all things is what is meant by Divine Truth. Some light on all this can be gained by considering the angels. From them emanates a sphere of charity and faith which is clearly perceptible 
and which also produces wondrous effects. From these one may form some idea of Divine Truth which emanates from the Lord's Divine Goodness. </p>

`Et extendit Moscheh baculum suum super terram Aegypti': quod significet dominium potentiae veri Divini super infestantium totum naturale, constat ex significatione `extendere baculum' quod sit dominium 
potentiae, de qua supra n. 7673; ex repraesentatione `Moschis' quod sit verum Divinum, de qua n. 6752, 7010, (a)7014, 7382; et ex significatione `terrae Aegypti' quod sit naturale quod infestantium, 
de qua supra n. 7674.  Potentia Divina, quae describitur per `manum Moschis,' est potentia veri Divini; `quod omnis potentia sit veri, videatur n. 3091, 5623, 6344, 6423, 6948; immo talis potentia 
est Divino Vero quod procedit ex Divino Bono, ut per illud creata sint omnia quae in universo; `Verbum' significat id Verum apud Johannem, In principio erat Verbum, et Verbum erat apud Deum, et Deus 
erat Verbum; omnia per Ipsum facta sunt, i 1, 3; </p>
<p>inde est quod per Moschen miracula facta sint, nam `Moscheh' repraesentat Divinum Verum.  Creditur a plerisque quod Verbum seu Divinum Verum sit modo 
loquela a Jehovah ac mandatum quod ita fiat, ac non amplius aliquid, sed est Ipsum Essentiale ex quo et per quod omnia; id Esse quod procedit ab Ipso, et inde Existere omnium, est quod intelligitur per 
Divinum Verum; hoc illustrari potest ab angelis: ab illis procedit sphaera charitatis et fidei quae sensibiliter percipitur, quae etiam producit mirabiles effectus; ex his aliqua idea formari potest 
de Divino Vero quod procedit a Divino Bono Domini. 	@1 verum enim Divinum vivificat illos qui in bono, quia ex bono in facultate sunt recipiendi illud, at verum Divinum mortificat illos qui in malo, 
quia malum est quod rejicit illud; inde devastatio; ex quibus patet quid intelligitur per dominum potentiae veri Divini super infestantium totum naturale$ </p>
