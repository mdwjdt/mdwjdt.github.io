Verses 34-36. And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy word. And he removed that day the he-goats that were party-colored and spotted, and all the she-goats that were speckled and 
spotted, everyone that had white in it, and all the black among the lambs, and gave them into the hand of his sons. And he set a way of three days between himself and Jacob; and Jacob fed the rest of 
Laban's flocks. "And Laban said, Behold I would it might be according to thy word," signifies consent; "and he removed that day the he-goats that were party-colored and spotted," signifies that those 
truths of good were separated that were scattered over and mingled with the evils and falsities that were proper to the good signified by "Laban;" "and all the she-goats that were speckled and spotted," 
signifies their goods in which evils and falsities were mingled; "everyone that had white in it," signifies truth; "and all the black among the lambs," signifies the own of innocence; "and gave them 
into the hand of his sons," signifies that they were given to truths; "and he set a way of three days between himself and Jacob," signifies that their state was altogether separated; "and Jacob fed 
the rest of Laban's flocks," signifies that from what was left he took those goods and truths that could be conjoined. </p>

Verses 34-36 And Laban said, Behold, let it be according to your word. And he removed on that day the variegated and spotted he-goats, and all the speckled and spotted she-goats, every one that had white 
in it, and every black one among the lambs; and he gave them into the hand of his sons. And he put three days' journey between himself and Jacob; and Jacob was feeding the rest of Laban's flocks. </p>
<p>'Laban 
said, Behold, let it be according to your word' means consent. 'And he removed on that day the variegated and spotted he-goats' means that the truths of good that were interspersed among and 
mingled with the evils and falsities belonging to the good meant by 'Laban' were singled out. 'And all the speckled and spotted she-goats' means every good of truth among which evil and falsity have 
been mingled. 'Every one that had white in it' means truth. 'And every black one among the lambs' means a proprium of innocence. 'And he gave them into the hand of his sons' means that they were given 
to truths. 'And he put three days' journey between himself and Jacob' means that their state was one in which they were totally set apart. 'And Jacob was feeding the rest of Laban's flocks' means that 
from the ones that were left there were taken the goods and truths which were to be joined to the good of truth. </p>

Vers. 34-36.  Et dixit Laban, Ecce utique sit secundum verbum tuum.  Et removit in die isto capros variegatos et maculosos, et omnes capras punctatas et maculosas, omne in quo album, et omne nigrum 
in agnis, et dedit in manum filiorum ejus.  Et posuit viam trium dierum inter se et inter Jacobum; et Jacob pascens greges Labanis reliquos. `Dixit Laban, Ecce utique sit secundum verbum tuum significat 
consensum: `et removit in die isto capros variegatos et maculosos' significat quod separarentur vera boni quae sparsa et mixta malis et falsis, quae propria bono per Labanem significato: `et 
omnes capras punctatas et maculosas' significat illorum bona in quibus mixta mala et falsa: `omne in quo album' significat verum: et omne nigrum in agnis' significat proprium innocentiae: `et dedit 
in manum filiorum ejus' significat quod darentur illa veris: `et posuit viam trium dierum inter se et inter Jacobum' significat statum illorum prorsus separatum: `et Jacob pascens greges Labanis 
reliquos' significat quod ex relictis desumeret illa bona et vera quae conjungerentur. </p>
