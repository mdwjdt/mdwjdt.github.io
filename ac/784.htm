<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>784.</strong>“耶和华关闭他身后的路”表这人不再享有属天教会成员所享有的与天堂的那类交流。其含义如下：上古教会的状态乃是这样，人们与天堂有内在的交流，并因此通过天堂与主交流。他们处于对主之爱，凡处于对主之爱的人就象天使，唯一区别在于，他们披着肉体。他们的内在毫不掩饰，一路向主敞开。但这个新教会却不同。它不是处于对主之爱，而是处于信，并通过信处于对邻之仁。他们不象上古之人那样拥有内在的交流，只有外在的交流。不过，要解释内在交流和外在交流的性质得花费很大的工夫。每个人都通过与他同在的天使和天堂交流，包括恶人，只是程度不同，也就是说，有的密切，有的疏远。若没有这种交流，人无法存在。这种交流的程度是无限的。一个属灵之人决不可能拥有象属天之人那样的交流，因为主居于爱中，不怎么居于信中。这就是“耶和华关闭他身后的路”所表示的含义。<br />自那时起，天堂从未象对上古教会之人那样开放。诚然，后来很多人与精灵（或灵spirits）并天使交谈，如摩西，亚伦及其他人，但交流的方式完全不同。对此，蒙主慈悲，容后再述。天堂被关闭的原因是一个非常深的奥秘，就象它如今被关闭到甚至没人知道精灵（或灵spirits）的存在，更不用说与他同在的天使，其原因也是奥秘一样。他以为在世时没有同伴在场、独自思考时，他完全孤身一人。殊不知，他始终与精灵（或灵spirits）相伴。这些精灵能发现并察觉人在想什么，他意欲并图谋什么，并且准确清晰到好象这一切都显明在全世界的人面前一样。而这人对此一无所知，天堂就是如此对他关闭的，然而，这却是千真万确的。原因在于，当他没有信，不用说信之真理，更不用说仁的时候，天堂若不对他如此关闭，他将面临巨大的危险。这也是下面这些话的含义：耶和华神将那人赶出去了，又从东边到伊甸园安设基路伯，还有剑的火焰自行转动，要把守生命树的道路（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创3.24.htm">3:24</a>，参看<w1>301<w2>301<w3>-<w1>307<w2>307<w3>节）。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]784.</strong> As for the fact that Jehovah closed it behind him means that people were no longer able to communicate with heaven the way the people of the heavenly church had, the case is this:<br />Circumstances in the earliest church allowed its people to communicate internally with heaven and through heaven with the Lord. They loved the Lord, and people who love the Lord are like angels, the only difference being that they are clothed in a body. Their deeper levels were open, offering unhindered access all the way to the Lord.<br />This new church, however, was different. Its people believed in rather than loved the Lord, and faith led them into charity toward their fellow humans. They could engage in external communication, but not in internal communication, as the earliest people had. Describing the two kinds of communication, though, would take too long.<br />We all communicate with heaven — even the sacrilegious — through the angels present with us. Without this, we would not be human. But the degree of intimacy varies from very close to very distant, with an unlimited number of steps in between. Spiritual people are wholly incapable of the kind of contact heavenly people have, because the Lord dwells in love and not so much in faith.<br />This, then, is the meaning of Jehovah closed it behind him.<br />[2] Moreover, heaven was never open after that era in the way that it had been for the people of the earliest church. It is true that many people — Moses, Aaron, and others — later talked to spirits and angels, but the method was entirely different. By the Lord's divine mercy, it will be described below [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_784/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_5121" target=_top>5121</a>].<br />The reason heaven was closed off and remains closed today is a deep secret. Heaven is so tightly shut that people are unaware even that spirits exist, let alone that angels are present with them. They suppose they are completely alone when they are away from companions in this world and thinking privately. The truth is that we are constantly in the company of spirits, who notice and perceive what we are thinking, and what we are intending and scheming. They observe these things as thoroughly and openly as if they stood out for all the world to see. We have no knowledge whatever that this is so, since heaven is so utterly closed to us, but it is positively true.<br />The reason is that were heaven not sealed off this way in humankind, it would be extremely dangerous for people, since they do not possess faith, much less religious truth, least of all charity. This is also the meaning of the words above at <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_784/bible_king-james-version_genesis_3_24" target=_top>Genesis 3:24</a> [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_784/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_306" target=_top>306-310</a>], "Jehovah God threw the humans out and caused guardian beings{*1} to live on the east of the Garden of Eden, and the flame of a sword turning itself, to guard the way to the tree of life."

And Jehovah shut after him. That this signifies that man no longer had such communication with heaven as had the man of the celestial church, appears from the following statement of the case. The state 
of the Most Ancient Church was such that they had internal communication with heaven, and so through heaven with the Lord. They were in love to the Lord. Those who are in love to the Lord are like 
angels, with the difference only that they are clothed with a body. Their interiors were uncovered, and were opened even from the Lord. But this new church was different. They were not in love to the 
Lord, but in faith, and through faith were in charity toward the neighbor. Such cannot have internal communication, like the most ancient man, but external. But the nature of internal and of external 
communication would take too long to explain. Every man, even the wicked, has communication with heaven, through the angels with him (but with a difference as to degree, that is, nearer or more remote), 
for otherwise man could not exist. The degrees of this communication are without limit. A spiritual man cannot possibly have such communication as can the celestial man, for the reason that the 
Lord is in love, and not so much in faith. And this is what is signified by "Jehovah shut after him."  [2] And since those times heaven has never been open in the way it was to the man of the Most Ancient 
Church. It is true that many afterwards spoke with spirits and angels: as Moses, Aaron, and others, but in an entirely different way, concerning which, of the Lord's Divine mercy hereafter. The 
reason why heaven was closed is deeply hidden, and why it is so closed at this day that man does not even know that there are spirits, still less that there are angels, with him, and supposes himself 
to be entirely alone when without companions in the world, and when he is thinking by himself. And yet he is continually in the company of spirits, who observe and perceive what the man is thinking, and 
what he intends and devises, as fully and plainly as if it were manifest before all in the world. This the man is ignorant of, so closed to him is heaven, and yet it is most true. The reason is that 
if heaven were not so closed to him while he is in no faith, still less in the truth of faith, and still less in charity, it would be most perilous to him. This is also signified by the words: </p>
<p>    
 Jehovah God drove out the man, and He placed at the east of the Garden of Eden the cherubim, and the flame of a sword that turned itself to keep the way of the tree of lives (Gen. 3:24; see also what 
is said in n. 301-303). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 784</b></p><p><b>784.</b>
The implications of 'Jehovah closed the way behind him' meaning that man no longer had the kind of communication with heaven that the member of the celestial Church had had are as follows: The state 
of the Most Ancient Church was such that men had an inward communication with heaven, and so by way of heaven with the Lord. They were governed by love to the Lord, and people who are governed by love 
to the Lord are like angels, the only difference being that they are clothed with a [physical] body. Their interiors were unconcealed and lay open all the way from the Lord. But it was different with 
this new Church. It was governed not by love to the Lord, but in and through faith, by charity towards the neighbour. They could not have, as the most ancient people had, any inward communication, only 
external. It would take too long however to discuss the nature of these two kinds of communication. Everybody has a communication of some kind, including the wicked, through the angels residing with 
them, though there are different degrees of it, from fairly close to quite remote. Without it a person could not exist. The degrees of communication are unending. A spiritual man cannot possibly have 
the kind of communication that a celestial man has, the reason being that the Lord dwells in love, and less so in faith. This is what the present statement means about Jehovah closing the way behind 
him. </p>

 Since those times heaven has never been open in the way it was for the member of the Most Ancient Church. Many people in later times have indeed talked to spirits and angels - for example, 
Moses, Aaron, and others - but they did so in a completely different way. This, in the Lord's Divine mercy, will be dealt with later on. The reason why heaven has been closed is a very deep arcanum, 
as also is the reason why it is so closed nowadays that no one knows even of the existence of spirits, let alone that angels are residing with him. He imagines that when he is not with fellow men in 
the world and when thinking all by himself he is completely alone. In fact however he is constantly in the company of spirits who observe and perceive very accurately what a person is thinking and what 
he intends and devises, as accurately and clearly as if this manifested itself for all the world to see. Of this man is not at all directly conscious, so closed is heaven to him. Nevertheless it is 
utterly true. The reason he is not conscious of it is that if heaven were not in this way closed to him at a time when faith is non-existent with him, still less the truth of faith, and charity even less, 
he would stand in very great danger. This was the meaning also of Jehovah God's casting man out and causing cherubim to dwell at the east end of the Garden of Eden, with a flaming sword turning about 
to guard the way to the tree of life,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> dealt with already in Chapter 3:14. See also <a href="301.htm">301</a>-<a href="307.htm">307</a>.

Quod 'clausit Jehovah post illum' significent quod amplius non communicationem haberet homo cum caelo, qualem caelesti Ecclesiae homo, ita se res habet: Antiquissimae Ecclesiae status fuit quod communicationem 
internam habuerint cum caelo, ita per caelum cum Domino; in amore in Dominum fuerunt; qui in amore in Dominum, illi sunt sicut angeli, modo cum differentia quod corpore induti; interiora illorum 
aperta fuerunt et patuerunt usque a Domino at Ecclesia haec nova aliter; non in amore in Dominum fuit, sed in fide et per fidem in charitate erga proximum; ii non internam, sicut antiquissimi, 
communicationem habere possunt, sed externam; sed qualis communicatio haec et illa sit, prolixum foret dicere: unusquisque homo communicationem habet, etiam impii per angelos apud eos, sed cum differentia 
quoad gradus, quod propius vel remotius; alioquin homo non posset esse:  gradus communicationis sunt indefiniti; spiritualis homo nusquam talem communicationem habere potes qualem caelestis homo, 
ex causa quia Dominus in amore est, non ita in fide; hoc nunc est quod significat, quod 'Jehovah clauserit post illum.' [2] Post illa tempora nec usquam apertum fuit caelum sicut Antiquissimae Ecclesiae 
homini; postea quidem plures locuti sunt cum spiritibus et angelis, sicut Moses, Aharon, et alii, sed prorsus alio modo, de quo, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, in sequentibus. Causa quod clausum sit 
caelum, arcanissima est, tum quod hodie clausum sit ita ut homo ne quidem sciat quod spiritus sint, minus quod angeli apud eum, et quod putet se prorsus solum esse cum absque sociis in mundo, et cum 
apud se cogitat; cum tamen in consortio spirituum est continue, qui tam probe animadvertunt et percipiunt quid homo cogitat et quid intendit et machinatur, tam probe et aperte sicut existeret coram 
omnibus in mundo; hoc nescit prorsus homo, ita clausum est ei caelum; cum tamen verissimum est: causa est, nisi clausum fuisset ita apud eum caelum, cum in nulla fide est, minus in veritate fidei, et 
adhuc minus in charitate, quod ei periculosissimum foret.  Hoc significatum etiam est per 	'Quod Jehovah Deus ejecerit hominem, et habitare fecerit ab oriente ad hortum Edenis cherubos, et flammam gladii 
vertentis se ad custodiendum viam arboris vitarum,' prius, cap. iii vers. 24; </p>
<p>videantur etiam quae n. 301-303. </p>
