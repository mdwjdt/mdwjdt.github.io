<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8712节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8712.</strong>“派他们作千夫长”表在直接来自神的真理之下、处于第一层级的首要真理。这从“夫长”和“千”的含义清楚可知：“夫长”（princes，即首领）是指首要真理（对此，参看<a href="1482.htm">1482</a>，<a href="2089.htm">2089</a>，<a href="5044.htm">5044</a>节），在此是指源于良善的真理，因为这些夫长或首领要在摩西之下进行服侍，而摩西代表从神性良善，也就是从主发出的神之真理；“千”是指那些处于第一层级的人。因为“一千”表示许多人，或在抽象意义上表示许多事物；它还表示有许多事物的地方，或那些掌管许多事物，由此等级高过掌管少数事物的人之人；故在此表示那些处于第一层级的人，因为那些处于较低层级的人是百夫长，五十夫长和十夫长。“一千”在内义上不是指一千，而是指许多事物或许多人（参看<a href="2575.htm">2575</a>节）。</p>

And do thou set them for princes of thousands. That this signifies the primary truths which are in the first degree under the truth that is immediately from the Divine, is evident from the signification 
of "princes," as being primary things (on which see n. 1482, 2089, 5044), here truths from good, because these princes were to be under Moses, by whom is represented truth Divine proceeding from Divine 
good, that is, from the Lord; and from the signification of "thousands," as being those who are in the first degree; for by "a thousand" are signified many persons, or in the abstract sense many 
things and where there are many things, or they who are over many, and are thereby in a degree of greater dignity than those who are over few; here therefore those who are in the first degree, for they 
who were in a lower degree were princes of hundreds, of fifties, and of tens (that in the internal sense "a thousand" does not mean a thousand, but many persons or many things, see n. 2575). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8712</b></p><p><b>8712.</b>
'And you are to appoint them rulers of thousands' means first and foremost truths in the first degree below truth coming directly from God. This is clear from the meaning of 'rulers' as first and foremost 
truths, dealt with in <a href="1482.htm">1482</a>, <a href="2089.htm">2089</a>, <a href="5044.htm">5044</a>,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> at this point truths springing from good since those rulers were to serve under Moses, who represents God's truth going forth from Divine Good, that is, 
from the Lord; and from the meaning of 'thousands' as those in the first degree. For 'a thousand' means many people or, in the abstract sense, many things; it also means where there are many things, or 
those who govern many and are consequently in a higher-ranking degree than those who govern few. Here therefore those in the first degree are meant, for those in a lower degree were rulers of hundreds, 
fifties, and tens. The fact that 'a thousand' in the internal sense is not a thousand but many things, see <a href="2575.htm">2575</a>.

`Et ponas {1}illos principes millenorum': quod significet primaria quae in primo gradu sub vero {2}immediato a Divino, constat ex significatione `principum' quod sint primaria, de qua n. 1482, 2089, 
5044, hic vera ex bono, quia principes illi {3}essent sub Moscheh, per quem repraesentatur verum Divinum procedens (c)a Divino Bono, hoc est, a Domino; et ex significatione `millenorum' quod sint qui 
in primo gradu; per `mille' enim significantur multi, seu in sensu abstracto multa, et ubi multa, seu qui multis praesunt, et inde in digniore gradu sunt quam qui paucis, hic itaque qui in primo gradu, 
nam qui in inferiore gradu, erant principes centenorum, quinquagenorum, et decadum; quod `mille' in sensu interno non sint mille sed multi aut multa, videatur n. 2575. 	@1 See p. 120, note 2, which
