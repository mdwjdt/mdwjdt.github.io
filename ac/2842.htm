<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2842节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2842.</strong>“说，我便指着自己起誓，耶和华说”表来自神性的不变的确认，也就是说，对于下文这些事的不变确认。这从“说，我便指着自己起誓”和“耶和华说”的含义清楚可知。所有这些话都包含确认，事实上是来自神性，即来自祂自己的确认。除了通过它自己，神性不可能通过任何其它源头来确认；并且它所确认的事是不变的，因为这就是永恒的真理。凡耶和华或主所说的话都是永恒的真理（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.35.htm">24:35</a>），因为它出自真理的存在本身。但祂似乎以起誓的方式确认一件事，如此处和圣言别处的情形，不是为了使当时那事显得更真实，而是为了与祂对话的那些人，因为若以这种方式加以确认，他们就不接受神圣真理。在这种人的观念里，耶和华或主就如同一个人，会说，也会改变，如我们在圣言中所经常读到的；但就内义而言，事情完全不是这样。谁都可以认识到，耶和华或主从不起誓的方式来确认任何事；但当神圣真理本身及其确认降至具有这种性质的人那里时，它就转化成了起誓的表象。其中的情形就如同耶和华或主降临西乃山时，有吞灭的火和冒出的烟出现在百姓眼前（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出19.18.htm">19:18</a>；申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申4.11.htm">4:11</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申4.12.htm">12</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/申5.19.htm">5:19</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申5.21.htm">21</a>）的情形。祂在天上的荣耀，甚至慈爱本身，以如同火与烟的方式出现在那里处于恶与假的百姓面前（参看<a href="1861.htm">1861</a>节）；圣言中提到的被视为耶和华所说所行的许多事都是这种情况。由此清楚可知，“我便指着自己起誓，耶和华说”这句话的意思是来自神性的不变的确认。<br />当论及耶和华时，“起誓”表示向某个具有这种性质的人确认。这从圣言中许多其它经文可以看出来。如诗篇：<br />耶和华记念祂的约，直到永远！祂所吩咐的话，直到千代；就是祂与亚伯拉罕所立的约，向以撒所起的誓。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗105.8.htm">105:8</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗105.9.htm">9</a>）<br />约与所起的誓是一样的情形，因为耶和华或主不会与人立约。不过，当所论述的主题是藉着爱与仁的结合时，这种结合也会以立约的实际事件来呈现（参看<a href="1864.htm">1864</a>节）。<br />耶和华起了誓，决不后悔说，你是照着麦基洗德的等次永远为祭司。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗110.4.htm">110:4</a>）<br />这论及主，“耶和华起了誓”表来自神性的不变的确认，即这是永恒的真理。<br /><br />我与我所拣选的人立了约，向我的仆人大卫起了誓。我要建立你的种，直到永远；要建立你的宝座，直到代代。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗89.3.htm">89:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗89.4.htm">4</a>）<br />这也论及主：“与所拣选的人立约”和“向大卫起誓”表不变的确认，或永恒的真理；“大卫”表主（<a href="1888.htm">1888</a>节）；“立了约”涉及神圣良善；“起了誓”涉及神圣真理。<br />我必不背弃我的约，也不改变我口中所出的话；我一次指着自己的圣洁起誓，我决不向大卫说谎。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗89.34.htm">89:34</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗89.35.htm">35</a>）<br />此处“大卫”也表主；“约”同样涉及神圣良善；“我口中所出的话”涉及神圣真理，之所以要这样行是因为良善与真理的婚姻，这婚姻存在于圣言的一切事物中（参看<a href="683.htm">683</a>，<a href="793.htm">793</a>，<a href="801.htm">801</a>，<a href="2516.htm">2516</a>，<a href="2712.htm">2712</a>节）。<br /><br />耶和华向大卫凭诚实起了誓，必不反覆。你的众子若守我的约和我所教导他们的法度，我必使你腹中出的果子坐你宝座。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗132.11.htm">132:11</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗132.12.htm">12</a>）<br />“耶和华向大卫凭诚实起了誓”明显表对永恒真理的确认；故经上说“必不反覆”；如前所述，大卫是指主；之所以向起誓，是因为他是那种认为确认适合他自己及其后裔的人；大卫被对自己及其后裔的爱所驱使，因此便以为这些声明与他有关，也就是如上述经文所说的，他的种要建立，直到永远，他的宝座要建立，直到代代；而事实上，这是指着主说的。<br />以赛亚书：<br />这事在我好像挪亚的洪水。我怎样起誓不再使挪亚的洪水漫过遍地，我也照样起誓不再向你发怒。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛54.9.htm">54:9</a>）<br />此处“起誓”表以起誓来立约并确认它。至于这是一个约，而非一个誓言，可参看创世记（<a href="http://39-27.cn/创9.11.htm">9:11</a>）。同一先知书：<br />万军之耶和华起誓说，我怎样思想，必照样成就。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛14.24.htm">14:24</a>）<br /><br />耶和华指着自己的右手和大能的膀臂起誓。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛62.8.htm">62:8</a>）<br />耶利米书：<br />所以你们住在埃及地的一切犹大人，当听耶和华的话；看哪，耶和华说，我指着我的大名起誓，在埃及全地，我的名不再被犹大任何人的口称呼说：主永生的耶和华。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶44.26.htm">44:26</a>）<br />同一先知书：<br />耶和华说，我指着自己起誓，波斯拉必变为荒场。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶49.13.htm">49:13</a>）<br /><br />万军之耶和华指着自己的灵魂起誓说：我必使人充满你，如同充满蝗虫。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶51.14.htm">51:14</a>）<br />阿摩司书：<br />主耶和华指着自己的圣洁起誓说，看哪，日子将到。（阿摩司书<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩4.2.htm">4:2</a>）<br />同一先知书：<br />耶和华指着雅各的荣耀起誓说，他们的一切行为，我都永远不忘。（阿摩司书<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩8.7.htm">8:7</a>）<br />在这些经文中，“耶和华指着自己的右手起誓”，“指着祂的大名”，“指着自己”，“指着自己的灵魂”，“指着自己的圣洁”，“指着雅各的荣耀”均表示耶和华或主里面的确认。耶和华的确认只可能来自祂自己。“耶和华的右手”，“耶和华的大名”，“耶和华的灵魂”，“耶和华的圣洁”，“雅各的荣耀”表示主的神性人；确认通过“起誓”而来。<br />耶和华或主“起誓”将那地赐给亚伯拉罕、以撒和雅各，或他们的后代在内义上表示确认祂会将天国赐给那些爱祂、信祂的人。就圣言的内义而言，亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各，或列祖的子孙后代所指的是他们；这也是以下事实所实际代表的：迦南地被赐给他们的后代，那时他们当中的教会代表主的天国；这地本身也是。“地”和“迦南地”在内义上是指主的国（参看<a href="1413.htm">1413</a>，<a href="1437.htm">1437</a>，<a href="1607.htm">1607</a>节）。这解释了为何在摩西书，经上说：<br />并使你们的日子，在耶和华向你们列祖起誓应许给他们和他们种的地上得以长久，那是流奶与蜜之地。使你们和你们子孙的日子，在耶和华向你们列祖起誓应许给他们的地上得以增多，如天覆地的日子那样多。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申11.9.htm">11:9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申11.21.htm">21</a>）<br />从上述经文清楚可知，耶和华“起誓”是确认的代表，事实是不变的确认的代表。这从以赛亚书看得更明显：<br />我指着自己起誓，我口所出的话是凭公义，并不返回，众膝必向我跪拜，众舌头必凭我起誓。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛45.23.htm">45:23</a>）<br />此外，那些属于犹太代表性教会的人在起誓确认所立的约，同样在确认誓言、应许，以及保证时，被规定要指着耶和华的名起誓。之所以这样规定他们（准确地说，仅仅是被准许），是因为内在人的确认也是这样来代表的。因此，那时指着耶和华的名起誓，和其它事一样，也就是说，它们也是代表物。这样的规定或准许明显可见于摩西书：<br />你要敬畏耶和华你的神，事奉祂，指着祂的名起誓；不可随从别神。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申6.13.htm">6:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申6.14.htm">14</a>）<br />同一先知书：<br />你要敬畏耶和华你的神，事奉祂，专靠祂，也要指着祂的名起誓。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申10.20.htm">10:20</a>）<br />以赛亚书：<br />在地上为自己求福的，必凭真实的神祝福自己；在地上起誓的，必指真实的神起誓。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛65.16.htm">65:16</a>）<br />耶利米书：<br />耶和华说，以色列啊，你若转回，转回归向我，若从我眼前除掉你可憎的偶像，不再摇摆不定；你必凭诚实、公平、公义，指着永生的耶和华起誓。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶4.1.htm">4:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶4.2.htm">2</a>）<br />同一先知书：<br />他们若殷勤学习我百姓的道，指着我的名起誓，那么他们就必建立在我百姓中间。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶12.16.htm">12:16</a>）<br />他们还指着“耶和华的名”起誓，或向“耶和华起誓”，这可见于以赛亚书：<br />听这话啊，雅各家，那称为以色列名下、从犹大的水出来的，你们指着耶和华的名起誓，提说以色列的神，却不凭诚实，不凭公义。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛48.1.htm">48:1</a>）<br />同一先知书：<br />当那日，埃及地必有五城的人说迦南的方言，又指着万军之耶和华起誓。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛19.18.htm">19:18</a>）<br />约书亚记：<br />会众的首领已经指着耶和华以色列的神向基遍人起誓。（约书亚记<a href="http://39-27.cn/书9.18.htm">9:18</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/书9.19.htm">19</a>）<br />由此明显可知，他们被准许指着耶和华的名或耶和华起誓。不过，很明显，这种起誓无非代表内在人的确认。众所周知，内在人，也就是那些拥有良知的人，无需通过起誓确认任何事；他们也不会如此确认。对他们来说，起誓是可耻的。事实上，他们能郑重声明某事就是如此，也能凭推理确认事实，但不会起誓说事情就是如此。他们受内在约束，也就是良知约束。在这约束上再加一个外在约束，也就是起誓，就是在暗示他们内心不诚实。而且，内在人具有这样的性质：他说话行事喜欢自由自在，而不是被强制。对这种人来说，内在掌控外在，而不是反过来。因此，拥有良知的人不会起誓，那些拥有对善与真的直觉之人，也就是属天之人更不会起誓。后者甚至不会凭推理向自己或其他人确认任何事，只是说，某事是这样或不是这样（<a href="202.htm">202</a>，<a href="337.htm">337</a>，<a href="2718.htm">2718</a>节）。所以，他们更是远离起誓。<br />由于这些原因，还由于起誓是属那些要被废除的代表物之列的，故主在马太福音中以这些话教导我们根本不必起誓：<br />你们又听见有话说，不可背誓，你所起的誓，总要向主履行。只是我对你们说：什么誓都不可起。不可指着天起誓，因为天是神的宝座；不可指着地起誓，因为地是祂的脚凳；也不可指着耶路撒冷起誓，因为耶路撒冷是大君的京城；又不可指着你的头起誓，因为你不能使一根头发变黑变白了。你们的话，是，就说是；不是，就说不是；若再多说，就是从恶里出来的。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太5.33.htm">5:33</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太5.37.htm">37</a>）<br />这些话就表示我们根本不必指着耶和华起誓，也不必指着凡属耶和华或主的任何事物起誓。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2842</b></p><p><b>2842.</b>
And said, By Myself have I sworn, saith Jehovah. That this signifies irrevocable confirmation from the Divine, namely, concerning the things which follow, is evident from the signification of "saying 
by Myself have I sworn," and of "saith Jehovah;" all which involve confirmation, and indeed from the Divine, that is, from Himself. The Divine cannot confirm from any other source than from Itself; and 
what it confirms is irrevocable, because it is eternal truth. Whatever Jehovah or the Lord speaks is eternal truth (Matt. 24:35), for it comes from the very being of truth. But His confirming it as 
it were by an oath (as here and elsewhere in the Word) is not for the reason that it may be more true, but for the reason that it is said to such as do not receive truth Divine unless it is so confirmed; 
for they have no other idea of Jehovah or the Lord than as of a man, who can say, and change, as we frequently read in the Word; but in the internal sense it is very different. Everyone may know 
that Jehovah or the Lord never confirms anything by an oath; but when the Divine truth itself, and its confirmation, passes down to a man of such nature, it is turned into the semblance of an oath. The 
case herein is as it was with the devouring fire and smoke that appeared upon Mount Sinai before the eyes of the people, when Jehovah or the Lord came down (Exod. 19:18; Deut. 4:11-12; 5:19-21): His 
glory in heaven, even mercy itself, appeared in this manner before the people there, who were in evil and falsity (see n. 1861); and the case is the same with many things called the sayings and doings 
of Jehovah that are spoken of in the Word. It may be seen from this that the expression, "by Myself have I sworn, saith Jehovah," is significative of irrevocable confirmation from the Divine.  [2] 
That to "swear," when predicated of Jehovah, signifies to confirm with a man who is of such nature, may be seen from many other passages in the Word; as in David: </p>
<p>     Jehovah remembered His covenant 
forever, the word which He commanded to a thousand generations; which He made with Abraham, and His oath unto Isaac (Ps. 105:8-9). The case is the same with a covenant as with an oath, in that Jehovah 
or the Lord does not make a covenant with man, but when conjunction by love and charity is treated of, this is set forth in act as a covenant (see n. 1864). In the same: </p>
<p>     Jehovah hath sworn, 
and will not repent, Thou art a Priest forever, after the manner of Melchizedek* (Ps. 110:4). This is said concerning the Lord, and "Jehovah hath sworn" denotes irrevocable confirmation from the Divine, 
that is, that it is eternal truth.  [3] In the same: </p>
<p>     I have made a covenant with My chosen, I have sworn unto David My servant, Thy seed will I establish forever, and build up thy throne to 
generation and generation (Ps. 89:3-4). This also is concerning the Lord: to "make a covenant with the chosen," and to "swear unto David," denote irrevocable confirmation or eternal truth; "David" denotes 
the Lord (n. 1888); to "make a covenant" regards the Divine good; to "swear," the Divine truth. In the same: </p>
<p>     My covenant will I not profane nor alter the thing that is gone out of My lips; 
once have I sworn by My holiness, I will not lie unto David (Ps. 89:34-35); </p>
<p>where also "David" denotes the Lord; the "covenant" here likewise has regard to the Divine good; and the "thing that has 
gone out of My lips," to the Divine truth, and this on account of the marriage of good and truth which is in everything in the Word (see n. 683, 793, 801, 2516, 2712).  [4] In the same: </p>
<p>     Jehovah 
hath sworn unto David in truth, He will not turn from it. Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne, if thy sons will keep My covenant, and My testimony that I shall teach them (Ps. 132:11-12); </p>
<p>"Jehovah 
hath sworn unto David in truth" manifestly denotes the confirmation of eternal truth; and therefore it is said, "He will not turn from it; "that by David is meant the Lord has been stated 
already; the oath was still "to David," because he was of such a character that he believed that the confirmation was concerning himself and his posterity; for David was in the love of himself and 
of his posterity, and hence believed that it was concerning him; that is, as said above, that his seed should be established forever, and his throne to generation and generation; but this was said of 
the Lord.  [5] In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     This is as the waters of Noah unto Me; for as I have sworn that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth, so have I sworn that I would not be wroth with thee 
(Isa. 54:9); </p>
<p>where to "swear" denotes making a covenant and confirming it by an oath. That it was a covenant, and not an oath, may be seen in Genesis 9:11. In the same: </p>
<p>     Jehovah hath sworn, saying, 
Surely as I have thought, so shall it come to pass (Isa. 14:24). In the same: </p>
<p>     Jehovah hath sworn by His right hand, and by the arm of His strength (Isa. 62:8). In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Hear ye 
the word of Jehovah, all Judah, that dwell in the land of Egypt; behold I have sworn by My great name, saith Jehovah, that My name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of Judah, saying, As 
the Lord Jehovih liveth, in all the land of Egypt (Jer. 44:26).      By Myself have I sworn, saith Jehovah, that Bozrah shall become a desolation (Jer. 49:13). In the same: </p>
<p>     Jehovah Zebaoth hath 
sworn by His soul, Surely I will fill thee with men as with the locust (Jer. 51:14). In Amos: </p>
<p>     The Lord Jehovih hath sworn by His holiness, that behold the days shall come (Amos 4:2). In the 
same: </p>
<p>     Jehovah hath sworn by the excellency of Jacob, Surely I will never forget any of their deeds (Amos 8:7). [6] In these passages, "Jehovah swearing by His right hand," "by His great name," 
by "Himself," by His "soul," by His "holiness," by the "excellency of Jacob," signifies the confirmation there is in Jehovah or the Lord. A confirmation by Jehovah can be given only from Himself. The 
"right hand of Jehovah," the "great name of Jehovah," the "soul of Jehovah," the "holiness of Jehovah," the "excellency of Jacob," signify the Lord's Divine Human: "swearing" thereby was confirmation. 
 [7] Jehovah or the Lord "swearing" to give the land to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, or to their posterity, signifies in the internal sense the confirmation that He would give the heavenly kingdom to 
those who are in love to Him and faith in Him. It is they who are meant in the internal sense of the Word by the sons and the posterity of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, or of the fathers; which was also 
actually represented by the fact that the land of Canaan was given to their posterity, and that the church at that time with them represented the Lord's heavenly kingdom, as the land itself also did. 
(That "land" and the "land of Canaan" in the internal sense is the Lord's kingdom, may be seen above, n. 1413, 1437, 1607.) It is from this that it is said in Moses: </p>
<p>     That ye may prolong your days 
upon the ground which Jehovah sware unto your fathers, to give unto them, and to their seed, a land flowing with milk and honey; that your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, upon 
the ground which Jehovah sware unto your fathers, to give them, as the days of the heavens upon the earth (Deut. 11:9, 21). From these passages it must now be evident that Jehovah's "swearing" was representative 
of confirmation, and indeed of an irrevocable one. This is still more plainly manifest in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     By Myself have I sworn, the word of righteousness is gone forth from My mouth, and 
shall not return, that to Me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear (Isa. 45:23). [8] Moreover it was enjoined upon those who were of the representative Jewish Church, that when they confirmed 
covenants by an oath, and likewise vows, also promises, and sureties, they should "swear by the name of Jehovah." The reason why this was enjoined upon them, although it was only permitted, was that 
the confirmation of the internal man also would thus be represented; so that oaths at that time in the name of Jehovah, were as other things were, namely, representative. That it was enjoined, that 
is, permitted, is evident in Moses: </p>
<p>     Thou shalt fear Jehovah thy God, and Him shall thou serve, and shalt swear by His name; ye shall not go after other gods (Deut. 6:13-14). Again in the same: </p>
<p> 
    Thou shalt fear Jehovah thy God, Him shalt thou serve and to Him shalt thou cleave, and shalt swear by His name (Deut. 10:20).      In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     He who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless 
himself in the God of truth, and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the God of truth (Isa. 65:16). In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     If thou wilt return, O Israel, saith Jehovah, unto Me shall thou return; 
and if thou wilt put away thine abominations from before Me, waver not; and thou shalt swear, Jehovah liveth, in truth, in judgment, and in righteousness (Jer. 4:1-2). In the same: </p>
<p>     If learning 
they will learn the ways of My people, to swear by My name, then they shall be built up in the midst of My people (Jer. 12:16). That they also swore "by the name of Jehovah," or swore "to Jehovah," 
may be seen in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Hear ye this, O house of Jacob, that are called by the name of Israel, and are come forth out of the waters of Judah, that swear by the name of Jehovah, and have made 
mention of the God of Israel, not in truth, and not in righteousness (Isa. 48:1). In the same: </p>
<p>     In that day there shall be five cities in the land of Egypt that speak the language of Canaan, and 
swear to Jehovah Zebaoth (Isa 19:18). In Joshua: </p>
<p>     The princes of the congregation sware to the Gibeonites by Jehovah the God of Israel (Josh. 9:18-19). [9] From this it is evident that they 
were permitted to swear by the name of Jehovah, or by Jehovah; yet it is evident that this was nothing else than a representative of the confirmation of the internal man. But it is known that internal 
men, that is, those who have conscience, have no need to confirm anything by an oath; and that they do not thus confirm. To them oaths are a cause of shame. They can indeed say with some asseveration 
that a thing is so, and can also confirm the truth by reasons; but to swear that it is so, they cannot. They have an internal bond by which they are bound, namely, that of conscience. To superadd to 
this an external bond, which is an oath, is like imputing to them that they are not upright in heart. The internal man is also of such a character that he loves to speak and act from freedom, but not 
from compulsion; for with them the internal compels the external, but not the reverse. On this account they who have conscience do not swear; still less do they who have perception of good and truth, 
that is, celestial men. These do not even confirm themselves or one another by reasons, but merely say that a thing is so, or is not so (n. 202, 337, 2718); wherefore they are still further removed from 
taking an oath.  [10] For these reasons, and because oaths were among the representatives which were to be abrogated, the Lord taught that we are not to swear at all, in these words in Matthew: </p>
<p> 
    Ye have heard that it has been said, Thou shalt not forswear thyself; but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths. But I say unto you, Swear not at all neither by the heaven, for it is God's throne; 
nor by the earth, for it is His footstool nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great king; neither shalt thou swear by thy head, for thou canst not make one hair white or black. But let your 
speech be, Yea, yea; nay, nay; for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil (Matt. 5:33-37). By these words is meant that we are not to swear at all by Jehovah, nor by anything which is of Jehovah

'And he said, By Myself I have sworn, says Jehovah' means unchangeable confirmation from the Divine, that is to say, regarding the things that follow. This becomes clear from the meaning of 'saying, 
by Myself I have sworn' and of 'says Jehovah', all of which imply confirmation, and indeed from the Divine, that is, from Himself. The Divine is unable to confirm from any other source than Himself, and 
that which He confirms is unchangeable because it is eternal truth. Whatever Jehovah or the Lord utters is eternal truth, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2024:%2035&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 24: 35</a>, since it comes from the very Being (Esse) itself of truth. But 
He confirms a thing seemingly with an oath, as He does here and elsewhere in the Word, not because that thing is then more true, but because He addresses Himself to persons who do not accept Divine 
truth unless it is confirmed in that way. For such persons do not have any other idea of Jehovah or the Lord than of a human being who is able to declare a thing and to change his mind, as one reads of 
many times in the Word; but in the internal sense the situation is altogether different. Anyone may recognize that Jehovah or the Lord never confirms anything with an oath, but when Divine Truth itself, 
and the confirmation of it, passes down to that kind of person it is converted into the semblance of an oath. It is as it was with the devouring fire and the smoke that appeared over Mount Sinai 
before the eyes of the people when Jehovah or the Lord came down, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2019:%2018&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 19: 18</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%204:%2011,%2012;%205:%2022-24&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 4: 11, 12; 5: 22-24</a>. In this case His glory in heaven, indeed His mercy, were seen by the people there, who were under 
the influence of evil and falsity, as fire and smoke, see <a href="1861.htm">1861</a>. Much the same applies to many things called the utterances or actions of Jehovah that are mentioned in the Word. From this it may become 
clear that 'by Myself I have sworn, says Jehovah' are words meaning unchangeable confirmation from the Divine. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 From many other places in the Word it becomes clear that when reference is made 
to Jehovah 'swearing' it means confirmation with someone who is like those that have just been referred to, as in David, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah is mindful of His covenant for ever, of the word He has commanded 
to a thousand generations, which He made with Abraham, and of His oath to Isaac. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20105:%208,%209&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 105: 8, 9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>It is similar with 'a covenant' as it is with 'an oath', for Jehovah or the Lord does not make a covenant 
with man. But when the subject is conjunction through love and charity, this is also presented in actual events as a covenant, see <a href="1864.htm">1864</a>. In the same author, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah has sworn and not repented, 
You are a Priest for ever after the manner of Melchizedek. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20110:%204&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 110: 4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the Lord. 'Jehovah has sworn' stands for unchangeable confirmation from the Divine, that is, that it is eternal 
truth. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In the same author, </p>
<blockquote>
I have made a covenant with My chosen one, I have sworn to David My servant, I will continue your seed even for ever, and build your throne from generation to 
generation. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2089:%203,%204&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 89: 3, 4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This too refers to the Lord. 'Making a covenant with the chosen one, and swearing to David' stands for unchangeable confirmation or eternal truth. 'David' stands for the Lord, <a href="1888.htm">1888</a>; 'making a covenant' has regard to Divine Good, 'swearing' to Divine Truth. In the same psalm, </p>
<blockquote>
I will not profane My covenant, and the utterance of My lips I will not alter. Once and for 
all I have sworn by My holiness, I will not lie to David. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2089:%2034,%2035&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 89: 34, 35</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here also 'David' stands for the Lord. 'Covenant' here again has regard to Divine Good, 'utterance of the lips' to Divine Truth. 
They do so on account of the marriage of good and truth, which marriage exists in every individual part of the Word, dealt with in <a href="683.htm">683</a>, <a href="793.htm">793</a>, <a href="801.htm">801</a>, <a href="2516.htm">2516</a>, <a href="2712.htm">2712</a>.  </p>

<a href="11.htm">11</a>, <a href="12.htm">12</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Jehovah has sworn the truth to David' plainly stands for the confirmation of eternal truth. Hence the statement 'from which He will not turn back'. As has been stated, 'David' is used to 
mean the Lord. This oath was sworn even to David because he was the kind of person who believed that the confirmation applied to himself and his descendants. For David was moved by self-love and love 
of his descendants, and this explains why he believed that what was declared - that is, as in the quotation above, that his seed would continue for ever and his throne from generation to generation 
- had reference to himself, when in fact what was said had reference to the Lord. </p>

 In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
This is as the waters of Noah to Me; as I swore that the waters of Noah should go no more over the 
earth, so I have sworn not to be angry with you. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2054:%209&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 54: 9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'swearing' stands for making a covenant and confirming it with an oath. As regards its being a covenant and not an oath, see Gen. 
9: <a href="11.htm">11</a>. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah has sworn, saying, Surely as I have thought, so will it be. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2014:%2024&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 14: 24</a>.

<p>In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Hear the Word of Jehovah, all you of Judah dwelling in the land of Egypt, Behold, I have sworn by My great name, said Jehovah, that My name will no more be invoked by the

<p>In Amos, </p>
<blockquote>

<p>In the same prophet, </p>
<p>Jehovah has sworn by the excellence of Jacob, Surely I will never forget any of their deeds. Amos 
8: <a href="7.htm">7</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 In all these places Jehovah's having sworn by His right hand, by His great name, by Himself, by His own soul, by His holiness, and by the excellence of Jacob, means the confirmation that 
there is in Jehovah or the Lord. No confirmation by Jehovah is possible except from Himself. Jehovah's right hand, Jehovah's great name, Jehovah's soul, Jehovah's holiness, and the excellence of Jacob 
mean the Lord's Divine Human; through the latter confirmation came. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 Jehovah's or the Lord's swearing to give the land to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and to their descendants, in the internal 
sense means confirmation that He would grant the heavenly kingdom to those in whom love and faith in Him are present. These are the ones who are meant in the internal sense of the Word by the sons and 
descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, that is, of the patriarchs. The same was also represented in the actual historical granting of the land of Canaan to their descendants; and the Church as it 
existed at that time among them represented the Lord's heavenly kingdom, as also did the land itself. For 'the land' and 'the land of Canaan' in the internal sense is the Lord's kingdom, see <a href="1413.htm">1413</a>, <a href="1437.htm">1437</a>, 
<a href="1607.htm">1607</a>. This explains why it is said in Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
That you may prolong your days on the land which Jehovah swore to your fathers to give to them, and to their seed, a land flowing with milk and honey; 
so that your days may be multiplied, and the days of your sons, on the land which Jehovah swore to your fathers to give them, as long as the days of the heavens above the earth. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2011:%209,%2021&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 11: 9, 21</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>From 
all these places it may now become clear that Jehovah's 'swearing' was representative of confirmation, and indeed of unchangeable confirmation, as is plainer still in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
By Myself I have 
sworn; out of My mouth has gone forth the word of righteousness, which will not return, that to Me every knee will bow, every tongue will swear. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2045:%2023&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 45: 23</a>.

<p><b>[8]</b>
 In addition to this, those who belonged 
to the Jewish representative Church were commanded when confirming covenants with an oath, likewise when confirming vows, as well as promises, and also guarantees, to swear by the name of Jehovah. 
The reason they were commanded - or to be exact, merely permitted - to do so was that the confirmation of the internal man would in that way also be represented. Thus it was that in those times oaths 
sworn by the name of Jehovah were like everything else, that is to say, they were representatives. The fact that such was commanded, that is, permitted, is clear in Moses, You shall fear Jehovah your 
God, and serve Him, and swear by His name; you shall not go after other gods. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%206:%2013,%2014&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 6: 13, 14</a>. </p>

<p>The fact that they also swore by the name of Jehovah, that is, swore to Jehovah, [is evident] in Isaiah, </p>

<p><b>[9]</b>
 From this it is clear that they were permitted to swear by the name of Jehovah or by Jehovah. But it is also clear that such swearing 
was nothing else than a representative of confirmation of the internal man. It is well known that internal people, that is, those who possess conscience, have no need to confirm anything by means of 
an oath; and that they do not so confirm. By them oaths are regarded with disapproval. They are indeed able to assert quite categorically that something is so, and also to confirm the truth with the 
aid of reasons; but to swear that a thing is so they cannot. They are governed by an internal bond - that of conscience. The addition to this of an external bond, which is an oath, is a kind of insinuation 
that they are not upright in heart. What is more, the internal man is such that he loves to speak and act in freedom and not under compulsion, for with such persons the internal controls the external, 
and not the reverse. People who possess conscience therefore do not swear oaths, still less do those do so who possess the perception of good and truth, that is, who are celestial people. The 
latter do not even, by means of reasons, confirm anything for themselves or for others, but they merely say that something is so, or else is not so, <a href="202.htm">202</a>, <a href="337.htm">337</a>, <a href="2718.htm">2718</a>. Consequently they are further removed 
still from any swearing with an oath. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[10]</b>
 For these reasons, and because oaths belonged among representatives which were to be brought to an end, the Lord teaches in the following words in Matthew 
that one should not swear at all, </p>
<blockquote>
You have heard that it was said, You shall not swear falsely, but shall perform to the Lord your oaths. But I say to you, You shall not swear at all, neither by 
heaven, for it is God's throne, nor by the earth, for it is His footstool, nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King. Nor shall you swear by your head, for you cannot make one hair white 
or black. But let your words be, Yes, yes; No, no; anything beyond this is from evil.<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%205:%2033-37&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 5: 33-37</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>These words are used to mean that one should not swear at all by Jehovah or by anything whatever 
that is Jehovah's or the Lord's.

et melle:...propterea ut multiplicentur      dies vestri, et dies filiorum vestrorum super humo, quam      juravit Jehovah patribus vestris ad dandum illis, juxta dies      caelorum super terra, Deut. 
xi [9], 21; </p>
<p>ex his locis nunc constare potest quod `jurare Jehovae' fuerit {13}repraesentativum confirmationis, et quidem irrevocabilis; ut manifestius adhuc patet apud Esaiam,           In Me juravi, 
exivit ex ore Meo justitiae verbum, et       non revertetur, quod Mihi incurvabit se omne genu, jurabit      omnis lingua, xlv 23. [8] Praeterea injunctum fuit illis qui ab Ecclesia repraesentativa 
Judaica fuerunt, cum juramento confirmarent foedera, pariter vota, ut et promissa, tum vadimonia, quod tunc jurarent in nomen Jehovae; quod hoc illis injunctum fuerit, tametsi modo permissum, 
erat causa ut sic quoque repraesentaretur confirmatio interni hominis; ita ut juramenta tunc in nomen Jehovae essent sicut cetera, nempe repraesentativa; quod injunctum, hoc est, permissum, constat apud 
Mosen,           Jehovam Deum tuam timebis, et Ipsi servies, et in nomen      Ipsius jurabis, non ibitis post deos alios, Deut. vi 13, 14; </p>
<p>alibi apud eundem,           Jehovam Deum Num timebis, 
Ipsi servies et Ipsi      adhaerebis, et in nomen Ipsius jurabis, Deut. x 20: </p>
<p>apud Esaiam,           Qui benedicit sibi in terra, benedicet in Deo      veritatis, et qui jurat in terra, jurabit in 
Deum veritatis,      lxv 16: </p>
<p>apud Jeremiam,           Si reverteris Israel, dictum Jehovae, ad Me revertaris,      et si removes abominationes a faciebus Meis, ne vacilles, et      jura, vivit 
Jehovah, in veritate, in judicio, et in justitia,      iv 1 [2]: </p>
<p>apud eundem,           Si discendo {14}discent vias populi Mei, adjurandum in      nomen Meum,...et aedificabuntur in medio populi 
Mei, xii 16. Quod etiam juraverint in nomen Jehovae, seu juraverint Jehovae, apud Esaiam,           Audite hoc, domus Jacobi, vocati nomine Israelis, et ex aquis Jehudae exiverunt, jurantes in nomen 
Jehovae, et Deum Israelis memorarunt, non in veritate, et non in justitia, xlviii 1: </p>
<p>apud eundem,           In die illo erunt quinque urbes in terra Aegypti,       loquentes labiis Canaanis, et 
jurantes Jehovae Zebaoth, xix      18: </p>
<p>apud Joshuam,           Jurarunt principes congregationis Gibeonitis, per       Jehovam Deum Israelis, ix 18, 19. [9] {15}Inde constat quod permissum illis 
jurare per nomen Jehovae, seu per Jehovam; sed quod id nihil aliud fuerit quam repraesentativum confirmationis interni hominis, {16}constat; notum {17}autem est quod interni homines, hoc est, qui conscientiam 
habent, non opus habeant aliquid per juramentum confirmare, et quod nec confirment, juramenta illis sunt pudori; dicere quidem possunt cum aliqua asseveratione quod ita sit, ut et veritatem confirmare 
per rationes, sed jurare quod ita sit, nequeunt; habent internum vinculum quo ligati, nempe conscientiae; illi superaddere vinculum externum, quod est juramentum, est sicut illis irrogare quod 
non recti corde sint; internus homo etiam talis est ut ex libero amet loqui et agere, non autem ex coacto, internum enim apud eos cogit externum, non autem vicissim; quare qui conscientiam habent, 
non jurant, minus adhuc qui perceptionem boni et veri, hoc est, caelestes homines; hi ne quidem per rationes apud se et inter se confirmant, sed modo dicunt quod ita sit vel non ita sit, n. 202, 337, 
2718, quare hi adhuc remotiores sunt a juramento; [10] inde est, et quia juramenta inter repraesentativa erant quae abroganda, quod Dominus doceat quod omnino non jurandum, his verbis apud Matthaeum,  
         Audivistis, quod dictum sit, Non pejerabis, solves vero      Domino juramenta tua, Ego vero dico vobis, Non jurabis omnino,      neque per caelum, quia thronus Dei est; neque per terram, 
quia      scabellum pedum Ipsius est; neque per Hierosolymam, quia urbs      est magni Regis; neque jurabis per caput tuum, quia non potes      unum pilum album aut nigrum facere; esto vero sermo vester,  
    immo immo, non non; quod ultra haec est, ex malo est, v,      33-37; </p>
<p>intelligitur per haec quod prorsus non jurandum per Jehovam, nec per quicquam quod est Jehovae seu Domini. @1 i et
