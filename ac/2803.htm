<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2803节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2803.</strong>“儿”是指神圣真理，“父”是指神圣良善。这从“儿”和“父”的含义，以及真理通过良善孕育和生出清楚可知：“儿”是指真理（参看<a href="489.htm">489</a>，<a href="491.htm">491</a>，<a href="533.htm">533</a>，<a href="1147.htm">1147</a>，<a href="2633.htm">2633</a>节）；“父”是指良善。前面多次说明，真理只能通过良善存在并彰显。此处，“儿”表神圣真理，“父”表神圣良善。这是因为，神性本质与人性本质，并人性本质与神性本质的融合就是良善与真理，并真理与良善的神圣婚姻，天上的婚姻就出自这神圣婚姻。因为耶和华或主里面只有无限之物，既如此，那么除了祂是一切善与真的存在与彰显，也就是说，祂是良善本身和真理本身外，人们不可能以其它任何概念来理解祂。良善本身是父，真理本身是子。由于神圣婚姻是良善与真理，并真理与良善的婚姻，故父在子里面，子在父里面，如主自己在约翰福音中所教导的：<br />耶稣对腓力说，我在父里面，父在我里面，你不信吗？你们当信我，我在父里面，父在我里面。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.10.htm">14:10</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.11.htm">11</a>）<br />同一福音书：<br />耶稣对犹太人说，我若不行我父的事，你们就不必信我；叫你们又知道又明白：父在我里面，我也在父里面。 （约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.37.htm">10:37</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.38.htm">38</a>）<br /><br />我为他们祈求，因为凡是我的都是你的，你的也是我的；使他们都合而为一。正如你父在我里面，我在你里面。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.9.htm">17:9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.10.htm">10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.21.htm">21</a>）<br /><br />如今人子得了荣耀，神在祂身上也得了荣耀；神既然在人子身上得了荣耀，也要在自己身上荣耀人子。父啊，荣耀你的儿子，使儿子也荣耀你。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约13.31.htm">13:31</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约13.32.htm">32</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.1.htm">17:1</a>）<br />由此可见神性与人性在主里面融合的性质，也就是说，它是相互交替的，即是一种互相融合。这就是被称为神圣婚姻的融合，天上的婚姻便由此降下，该融合就是主在天上的国度本身，在约翰福音中被论及如下：<br />到那日，你们就知道我在我父里面，你们在我里面，我在你们里面。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.20.htm">14:20</a>）<br /><br />我为他们祈求，使他们都合而为一，正如你父在我里面，我在你里面。使他们也在我们里面合而为一，我在他们里面，你在我里面；使你所爱我的爱在他们里面，我也在他们里面。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.21.htm">17:21</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.23.htm">23</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.26.htm">26</a>）<br />这天上的婚姻就是良善与真理，并真理与良善的婚姻（参看<a href="2508.htm">2508</a>，<a href="2618.htm">2618</a>，<a href="2728.htm">2728</a>，<a href="2729.htm">2729</a>节等）。<br />由于神圣良善没有神圣真理不可能存在和彰显，神圣真理没有神圣良善也是如此，这二者彼此在对方里面、互相回应，故显而易见，神圣婚姻自永恒就存在，也就是说，父在子里面，子在父里面，如主自己在约翰福音中所教导的：<br />父啊，现在求你使我同你自己享荣耀，就是未有世界以先，我同你所有的荣耀。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.5.htm">17:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.24.htm">24</a>）<br />但自永恒所生的神性人也生在时间中，生在时间中的和被荣耀的是一回事。正因如此，主才多次说，祂要到差祂来的父那里去，也就是说，祂要回到父那里去。约翰福音：<br />太初有道（“道”或圣言就是神圣真理本身），道与神同在，道就是神；这道太初与神同在。万物都是藉着祂造的，凡被造的，没有一样不是藉着祂造的。道成了肉身，住在我们中间，我们也见过祂的荣光，正是父独生子的荣光，充充满满有恩典有真理。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.1.htm">1:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.3.htm">3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.14.htm">14</a>；也可参看约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.13.htm">3:13</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.62.htm">6:62</a>）</p>

That the Divine Truth is the "son," and the Divine Good the "father," is evident from the signification of a "son," as being truth (see n. 489, 491, 533, 1147, 2633); and of a "father," as being good; 
and also from the conception and birth of truth, which is from good. Truth cannot be and come forth [existere] from any other source than good, as has been shown many times. That the "son" here is the 
Divine Truth, and the "father" the Divine Good, is because the union of the Divine Essence with the Human, and of the Human Essence with the Divine, is the Divine marriage of Good with Truth, and of 
Truth with Good, from which comes the heavenly marriage; for in Jehovah or the Lord there is nothing but what is infinite; and because infinite, it cannot be apprehended by any idea, except that it 
is the being and the coming forth [esse et existere] of all good and truth, or is Good itself and Truth itself. Good itself is the "Father," and Truth itself is the "Son." But because as before said there 
is a Divine marriage of Good and Truth, and of Truth and Good, the Father is in the Son, and the Son is in the Father, as the Lord Himself teaches in John: </p>
<p>     Jesus saith unto Philip, Believest 
thou not that I am in the Father and the Father in Me ? Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father in me (John 14:10-11). And again in the same Evangelist: </p>
<p>     Jesus said to the Jews, Though 
ye believe not Me, believe the works; that ye may know and believe that the Father is in Me, and I in the Father (John 10:36, 38). And again: </p>
<p>     I pray for them for all Mine are Thine, and Thine 
are Mine; and that they all may be one, as Thou Father art in Me, and I in Thee (John 17:9, 10, 21). And again: </p>
<p>     Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in Him; if God be glorified 
in Him, God shall also glorify Him in Himself. Father, glorify Thy Son, that Thy Son also may glorify Thee (John 13:31-32; 17:1). [2] From this may be seen the nature of the union of the Divine and 
the Human in the Lord; namely, that it is mutual and alternate, or reciprocal; which union is that which is called the Divine Marriage, from which descends the heavenly marriage, which is the Lord's 
kingdom itself in the heavens -thus spoken of in John: </p>
<p>     In that day ye shall know that I am in My Father, and ye in Me, and I in you (John 14:20). And again: </p>
<p>     I pray for them, that they all 
may be one, as Thou Father art in Me and I in Thee, that they also may be one in us, I in them and Thou in Me; that the love wherewith Thou hast loved Me may be in them, and I in them (John 17:21-23, 
26). That this heavenly marriage is that of good and truth, and of truth and good, may be seen above (n. 2508, 2618, 2728, 2729 and following numbers).  [3] And because the Divine Good cannot be and 
come forth without the Divine Truth, nor the Divine Truth without the Divine Good, but the one in the other mutually and reciprocally, it is therefore manifest that the Divine Marriage was from eternity; 
that is, the Son in the Father, and the Father in the Son, as the Lord Himself teaches in John: </p>
<p>     And now O Father, glorify Thou Me with Thyself, with the glory which I had with Thee before 
the world was (John 17:5, 24).      But the Divine Human which was born from eternity was also born in time; and what was born in time, and glorified, is the same. Hence it is that the Lord so often 
said that He was going to the Father who sent Him; that is, that He was returning to the Father. And in John: </p>
<p>     In the beginning was the Word (the "Word" is the Divine Truth itself), and the Word 
was with God, and the Word was God; the same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything made that was made. And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among 
us, and we saw His glory, the glory as of the Only-begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth (John 1:1-3, 14; see also John 3:13; 6:62). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2803</b></p><p><b>2803.</b>
As regards Divine Truth being meant by 'son' and Divine Good by 'father', this becomes clear from the meaning of 'son' as truth, dealt with in <a href="489.htm">489</a>, <a href="491.htm">491</a>, <a href="533.htm">533</a>, <a href="1147.htm">1147</a>, <a href="2623.htm">2623</a>, and of 'father' as good, and 
also from the conception and birth of truth as taking place from good. As has been shown many times, truth cannot have being or manifest itself except from good. The reason 'son' here means Divine Truth, 
and 'father' Divine Good, is that the union of the Divine Essence with the Human Essence, and of the Human Essence with the Divine Essence, is the Divine Marriage of Divine Good to Truth, and of Truth 
to Good; and from that marriage comes the heavenly marriage. For within Jehovah or the Lord there is nothing but that which is infinite, and this being so, no other idea can be conceived of Him than 
that He is the Being and Manifestation (Esse et Existere) of all good and truth, that is, He is Good itself and Truth itself. Good itself is the Father, and Truth itself the Son. Now because the Divine 
Marriage, as has been stated, is a marriage of Good and Truth, and of Truth and Good, the Father is in the Son, and the Son is in the Father, as the Lord Himself teaches in John, </p>
<blockquote>
Jesus said to 
Philip, Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father in Me? Believe Me that I am in the Father, and the Father in Me. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2014:-10,%2011&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 14:-10, 11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And elsewhere in the same evangelist, </p>
<blockquote>
Jesus 
said to the Jews, Even though you do not believe Me, believe the works, that you may know and believe that the Father is in Me, and I in the Father. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2010:-36,%2038&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 10:-36, 38</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And elsewhere, </p>
<blockquote>
I pray for them 
- for all things that are Mine are Yours, and Yours are Mine - that they may all be one, as You, Father, are in Me and I in You <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2017:-9,%2010,%2021&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 17:-9, 10, 21</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And elsewhere, </p>
<blockquote>
Now is the Son of Man glorified, 
and God glorified in Him. If God is glorified in Him, God will also glorify Him in Himself. Father, glorify Your Son, that Your Son also may glorify You. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2013:-31,%2032;%2017:%201&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 13:-31, 32; 17: 1</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 From these 
places one may see the nature of the union of the Divine and of the Human within the Lord - that each is linked mutually to the other and responds to the other - that is, it is a reciprocal union. This 
is the Union which is called the Divine Marriage, from which the heavenly marriage comes down, which is the Lord's kingdom itself in heaven and is referred to in John as follows, </p>
<blockquote>
On that day you 
will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2014:-20&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 14:-20</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And elsewhere, </p>
<blockquote>
I pray for these, that they may all be one, as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may 
be one in Us, I in them and You in Me, that the love with which You have loved Me may be in them, and I in them. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2017:-21-23,%2026&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 17:-21-23, 26</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 As regards this heavenly marriage being a marriage of good 
and truth, and of truth and good, see <a href="2508.htm">2508</a>, <a href="2618.htm">2618</a>, <a href="2728.htm">2728</a>, <a href="2729.htm">2729</a> and following paragraphs. And since Divine Good cannot possibly have being or manifest itself without Divine Truth, and Divine Truth cannot 
possibly do so without Divine Good, but one is always reaching out to and responding to the other, it is therefore plain that the Divine Marriage has existed from eternity, that is, the Father in the 
Son, and the Son in the Father, as the Lord Himself teaches in John, </p>
<blockquote>
Now, Father, glorify Me in Your Own Self with the glory I had with You before the world was. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2017:-5,%2024&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 17:-5, 24</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>But the Divine 
Human that had been born from eternity was also born in time, and what was born in time is the same as that which was glorified. This is what accounts for the Lord's saying many times that He was going 
to the Father who sent Him, that is, He was returning to the Father. And in John, </p>
<blockquote>
In the beginning was the Word (the Word being Divine Truth itself), and the Word was with God, and the Word was 
God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything made that was made. Furthermore the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory, 
glory as of the Only Begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%201:-1-3,%2014&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 1:-1-3, 14</a>.

</p><b>2803.</b>
Quod Divinum Verum sit `filius,' et Divinum Bonum sit `pater,' constare potest ex significatione `filii' quod sit verum, de qua n. 489, 491, 533, 1147, 2623; et `patris' quod sit bonum: tum ex conceptione 
et nativitate veri quod sit ex bono; aliunde verum quam ex bono esse et existere nequit, ut pluries ostensum: hic quod `Filius' sit Divinum Verum, et `Pater' Divinum Bonum, est quia Unio Divinae 
Essentiae cum Humana, et Humanae cum Divina, est Conjugium Divinum Boni cum Vero, et Veri cum Bono, ex Quo conjugium caeleste; in Jehovah enim seu Domino nihil est nisi infinitum, et quia infinitum, 
non capi potest aliqua idea, modo quod sit Esse et Existere omnis boni et veri, seu ipsum Bonum et ipsum Verum; ipsum Bonum est Pater, et ipsum Verum est Filius; sed quia Conjugium Divinum est, ut dictum, 
Boni et Veri, et Veri et Boni, est Pater in Filio, et Filius in Patre, ut Ipse Dominus docet apud Johannem,      Jesus dicit ad Philippum, Nonne credis, quod Ego in Patre et      Pater in Me?... 
credite Mihi, quod Ego in Patre et Pater in      Me, xiv 10, 11 et alibi apud eundem Evangelistam,      Jesus dixit ad Judaeos, Si utique Mihi non creditis, operibus      credite, ut cognoscatis 
et credatis, quod Pater in Me, et Ego      in Patre, x 36, 38: </p>
<p>et alibi,      Ego pro illis oro,...omnia namque Mea Tua sunt, et Tua      Mea,...utque omnes unum sint, sicut Tu Pater in Me, et Ego 
in      Te, xvii 9, 10, 21: </p>
<p>et alibi,      Nunc glorificatus est Filius hominis, et Deus glorificatus in      Ipso; si Deus glorificatus est in Ipso, etiam Deus      glorificabit Ipsum in Se Ipso:... 
Pater glorifica Filium Tuum,      ut etiam Filius Tuus glorificet Te, xiii 31, 32; xvii 1; </p>
<p>[2] inde constare potest qualis est {1} unio Divini et Humani in Domino, quod nempe sit mutuo et vicissim 
seu reciproca, quae Unio est quae vocatur Conjugium Divinum, ex quo descendit conjugium caeleste, quod est ipsum regnum Domini in caelis, de quo ita apud Johannem,      In illo die cognoscetis, 
quod Ego in Patre Meo, et vos in Me,      et Ego in vobis, xiv 20: </p>
<p>et alibi,      Pro his oro, ut omnes unum sint, sicut Tu Pater in Me et Ego      in Te, ut etiam illi in Nobis unum sint, Ego in 
illis et Tu in      Me;... ut amor, quo amasti Me, in illis sit, et Ego in illis,      xvii 21-23, 26; </p>
<p>[3] quod conjugium hoc caeleste sit boni et veri, ac veri et boni, videatur n. 2508, 2618, 2728, 
2729 seq.; et quia Divinum Bonum nusquam esse et existere potest absque Divino Vero, et Divinum Verum nusquam absque Divino Bono, sed unum in altero mutuo et vicissim, inde manifestum est quod Conjugium 
Divinum fuerit ab aeterno, hoc est, Filius in Patre, et Pater in Filio, ut Ipse Dominus docet apud Johannem,      Nunc glorifica Me, Tu Pater, apud Te Ipsum, gloria, quam habui      antequam 
mundus esset, apud Te, xvii 5, 24; </p>
<p>[4] sed Divinum Humanum quod fuit natum ab aeterno, {2} nascebatur etiam in tempore, et quod natum in tempore, et {3} glorificatum, idem est; inde est quod toties 
Dominus dixerit quod iret ad Patrem Qui misit Ipsum, hoc est, quod ad Patrem rediret; et apud Johannem,      In principio erat Verbum, (Verbum est ipsum Divinum Verum) et      Verbum erat apud Deum, 
et Deus erat Verbum; hoc erat in      principio apud Deum; omnia per Ipsum facta sunt, et sine Ipso      factum est nihil quod factum est: ceterum Verbum caro factum,      et habitavit in nobis, et 
vidimus gloriam Ipsius, gloriam      sicut Unigeniti a Patre, plenus gratia et veritate, i 1-3, 14; </p>
