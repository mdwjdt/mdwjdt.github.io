<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6954节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6954.</strong>“它在他手中又变成杖”表这时，来自神性的能力被赐予。这从“变成杖的蛇”、“杖”和“手”的含义清楚可知：“变成杖的蛇”是指感官层，如前所述（<a href="6949.htm">6949</a>节）；“杖”是指属世层中的能力；“手”内在能力，这两种能力都来自神性（<a href="6952.htm">6952</a>节）。此中情形是这样：任由自己，人只会向下看，也就是注视世界和大地，因为凭他自己，他就会陷入邪恶与虚假。当他朝这个方向看时，感官层就会掌权，内层事物不做反对它的任何事，因为它们随从流动的力量，并屈服于它。然而，不任由自己，而是得到主的帮助之人向上看，也就是仰望天堂和主；这一切通过一种提升实现。当内层被提升时，感官层也被提升。但那时，感官层上的低劣之光变得模糊、暗淡，因为天堂之光掌权了。当这种事发生时，良善与真理从主流入，也被接受；这就是“来自神性的能力被赐予”的意思。然而，除了那些活在信与仁之良善中的人外，没有人能以这种方式被提升。我通过活生生的经历得以知道朝向内层的这种提升，因为我感受过上千次。</p>

And it became a rod in his hand. That this signifies that then was communicated power from the Divine, is evident from the signification of the "serpent which became a rod," as being the sensuous (of 
which above, n. 6949); from the signification of a "rod," as being power in the natural; and from the signification of the "hand," as being interior power; both powers being from the Divine (n. 6952). 
The case herein is this. From himself man looks downward only, that is, into the world, and to the earth, because from himself he is in evil and falsity; and when he looks thither, then the sensuous 
has dominion, and interior things makes no opposition, because they follow the force of the stream, and yield to it. Nevertheless not from himself but from the Lord, man looks upward, that is, to heaven 
and to the Lord, which is effected by means of an uplifting and when the interiors are uplifted, the sensuous also is uplifted, but its light is then obscured, because the light of heaven has dominion. 
When this takes place, good and truth from the Lord flow in, and are also received; and this is meant by power communicated from the Divine. Yet no others can be uplifted in this way than those 
who have lived in the good of faith and of charity. That the upliftings are toward the interiors, has been given me to know from living experience, for they have been observed a thousand times. </p>

'And it was made into a rod in the palm of his hand' means that at this point the power from the Divine was imparted. This is clear from the meaning of the serpent, which 'was made into a rod', as the 
sensory level, dealt with above in <a href="6949.htm">6949</a>; and from the meaning of 'a rod' as power in the natural, and of 'the palm of the hand' as inward power - both kinds of power coming from the Divine, dealt with 
in <a href="6952.htm">6952</a>. The situation is that left to himself a person looks merely downwards, that is, in a worldly and earthly direction, because left on his own he is ruled by evil and falsity. And when that is 
the direction in which he looks, the sensory level is in control, and things on more internal levels do nothing to oppose it, since they follow the force of the stream and give way to it. The person 
however who is not left to himself but is aided by the Lord looks upwards, that is, towards heaven and the Lord; and this happens through his being raised up. At the same time as the more internal parts 
are raised so too is the sensory level raised. But the inferior light on that sensory level then becomes dim because the light of heaven reigns. When this happens goodness and truth flow in from the 
Lord and are also received; and this is what is meant by 'the power from the Divine was imparted'. None however can be raised in that way except those who have displayed the good of faith and charity 
in their lives. I have been allowed to know from actual experience about being raised towards more internal things, for I have felt it thousands of times. </p>

`Et factus in baculum in vola illius': quod significet quod tunc communicata potentia a Divino, constat a significatione `serpentis qui factus in baculum' quod sit sensuale, de qua supra n. 6949; ex 
significatione `baculi' quod sit potentia {1}in naturali, et ex significatione `volae' {2} quod sit potentia {3}interior, (x)utraque potentia a Divino, de quibus n. 6952.  Cum hoc ita se habet: homo 
ex se spectat modo deorsum, hoc est, in mundum et ad terram, quia ex se in malo et falso est; et cum illuc spectat, tunc sensuale dominatur, (c)ac interiora nihil contra agunt, quia sequuntur vim fluminis 
et condescendunt; ast homo non ex se sed (c)a Domino spectat sursum, hoc est, ad caelum et ad Dominum; hoc fit per elevationem; {4}tunc cum elevantur interiora, etiam elevatur sensuale, {5} sed lumen 
{6}hujus tunc obscuratur, dominatur enim lux caeli; cum hoc fit, influit bonum et verum a Domino, et quoque recipitur; hoc intelligitur per communicatam potentiam a Divino; sed ita elevari non possunt 
alii quam qui in bono fidei et charitatis vixerunt.  Quod elevationes versus interiora sint, scire datum est ex viva experientia, nam millies apperceptae sunt. 	@1 naturalis$ 	@2 i seu manus$ 	@3 
ex Divino, quia per Moschen, in cujus manu serpens factus est baculus: repraesentatur Dominus quoad Divinum Verum, in Humano; et quia serpens per quem sensuale significatur, factus est baculus, per 
quem potentia naturalis significatur in vola manus Moschis, per quam significatur potentia a Divino, inde significatur potentia sensuali per influxum, ita quod communicata sit potentia a Divino$ 	@4
