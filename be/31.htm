<h3 align="center" class="ired">《新教会教义纲要》 第31节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>BE31.简要分析：先说明三个位格的三一，因而三位上帝的三一的根源所在。有三大信经特别提及三一，它们是《使徒信经》、《尼西亚信经》和《亚他尼修信经》。《使徒信经》和《尼西亚信经》只是教导三一，而《亚他那修信经》教导三个位格的三一。这三大信经出现在许多圣诗集中：《使徒信经》列在《诗篇》之后用来咏唱，《尼西亚信经》列于《十诫文》之后，《亚他那修信经》则另行单列*。《使徒信经》完成于使徒时代之后。《尼西亚信经》完成于尼西亚会议——公元325年由君士坦丁大帝邀请亚、非、欧所有主教在比提尼亚行省中的尼西亚城举行。《亚他那修信经》乃是在《尼西亚信经》之后由某个人或某些人制定，旨在完全推翻亚流主义，后来被众教会统一接受。显而易见，前两大信经中有三一的信仰，但第三大信经或《亚他那修信经》却导致三个位格之三一（三位一体）信仰的广泛散播。从此，三位上帝的观念开始流行起来，接下来会说明这一点。附注：*关于欧洲大陆的更正教众教会中的情形。</p>

<h4 align="center">A Brief Exposition of New Church Doctrine (Stanley translation 1953) 31</h4>
<p>31. BRIEF ANALYSIS
<p>Something shall first be said concerning the source from which the idea of a Trinity of Persons in the Godhead, thus of three Gods, has proceeded. There are three creeds, called the Apostles', the Nicene and the Athanasian, which specifically teach the Trinity. The Apostles' and the Nicene teach just the Trinity, whilst the Athanasian teaches a Trinity of Persons. These three creeds appear in many of the Books of Worship (Libris Psalmorum); the Apostles' Creed as a psalm which is sung, the Nicene after the Decalogue, and the Athanasian apart by itself. The Apostles' Creed was written after the time of the Apostles. The Nicene Creed was composed at the Council of Nicaea, a city of Bithynia, to which all the bishops in Asia, Africa and Europe were summoned by the Emperor Constantine in the year AD. 325. The Athanasian Creed was composed after that Council by some person or persons in order utterly to overthrow the Arians, and was afterwards received by the churches as ecumenical. From the first two creeds the confession of a Trinity clearly appeared, but from the third or Athanasian Creed proceeded the profession of a Trinity of Persons. That hence arose the idea of three Gods will be seen from what now follows. </p>

<p>31. BRIEF ANALYSIS. 
<p>We will first say something concerning the origin or source from whence the idea of a Trinity of Persons in the Divinity, and thereby of three Gods, proceeded. There are three Creeds, which are called the Apostles', the Nicene, and the Athanasian, which specifically teach a Trinity: the Apostles' and the Nicene assert simply a Trinity, but the Athanasian a Trinity of Persons. These three Creeds are to be met with in many Psalters, the Apostles' Creed next the Psalm which is sung, the Nicene after the Decalogue, and the Athanasian apart by itself. <sup>1</sup>The Apostles' Creed was written after the times of the Apostles; the Nicene Creed at the Council of Nice, a city of Bithynia, to which all the bishops in Asia, Africa, and Europe, were summoned by the Emperor Constantine, in the year 325 <sup id="fn108_2">2</sup>; but the Athanasian Creed was composed since that council by one or more persons, with an intent utterly to overthrow the Arians and was afterwards received by the churches as ecumenical. In the two former creeds the confession of a Trinity was evident, but from the third or Athanasian Creed the profession of a Trinity of Persons was spread abroad: that hence arose the idea of three Gods, shall now be shown.

<p>31. BREVIS ANALYSIS.
<p>Primum aliquid dicetur de origine, seu unde profluxit idea Trinitatis personarum in Divinitate, et. inde trium Deorum. Sunt Tria Symbola, quae vocantur Apostolicum, Nicaenum, et Athanasianum, quae in specie docent Trinitatem; Apostolicum et Nicaenum ipsam Trinitatem, at Athanasianum Trinitatem personarum. Tria illa Symbola in multis Libris Psalmorum exstant, Apostolicum in Psalmo qui canitur, Nicaenum post decalogum, et Athanasianum seorsim ibi. Symbolum Apostolicum post Apostolorum tempora conscriptum est; Symbolum Nicaenum in Concilio Niceae urbis Bithyniae <sup>1</sup>habito, ad quod ab Imperatore Constantino omnes Episcopi in Asia, Africa, et Europa, Anno 325 <sup>2</sup>, convocati sunt. Symbolum autem Athanasianum post illud Concilium a quodam vel a quibusdam, ad Arrianos <sup>3</sup>prorsus profligandos, compositum est, et postea ab Ecclesiis etiam ut Oecumenicum acceptatum. Ex duobus prioribus Symbolis illuxit confessio Trinitatis, ex tertio autem seu Athanasiano effluxit professio Trinitatis personarum; quod inde idea trium Deorum sit, videbitur in nunc sequentibus.
