<h3 align="center" class="ired">《新教会教义纲要》 第52节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>BE52.简要分析：通过经历来说明这一点。如今，根据宗教原则，按照十诫的戒律和主的其他戒律生活的人数有多少？如今有多少人愿意直视自己的邪恶，进行真正的悔改，从而进行生活中的敬拜呢？或者说，在那些表现虔诚的人当中，除了口头和言语上承认自己是罪人，并照着教会的教导向父上帝祷告，因圣子为他们的罪在十字架上受难，除去了他们的诅咒，并以他的宝血为他们赎罪，圣父出于怜悯而慈悲地宽恕他们的过犯，以至于他们在他的审判台前站得住脚，除此以外，作了其它任何悔改吗？谁看不出这种敬拜只是出于肺而非发自内心，也就是说，是外在的敬拜，不是内在的？因为在这样的敬拜中，一个人祈求罪得宽恕，却不知道自己身上有什么罪孽；如果他理应知道的话，他会加以偏袒和放纵，或者以一种想当然的被洁净和宣告无罪的信念将它包起来，自己这一方没任何行动。这可以比作一个仆人，满脸煤烟衣衫脏乱来见主人，大声说：“主人，主洁净我。”他的主人难道不会对他说：“你这个愚蠢的仆人，你在说什么？瞧，那里有水，肥皂和毛巾。你没有手，不能用它们吗？赶快自己洗干净！”同样，主上帝难道不会说：“从我这可得到洁净的工具，你还可以从我得着意志和能力。因此，利用我的这些恩赐和你自己的才能吧，你就能洁净。”还可通过另一个例子来说明。假设应该在家中和教堂中祈祷一千次，以求父上帝为他儿子的缘故使你免受魔鬼的侵害，但你并没有同时出于选择的自由——主一直保持我们有这样的自由——远离邪恶，因而远离魔鬼，在这种情况下，即使主派遣的一个营的天使也保护不了你；因为主不能行事违背他自己的神性规则，他的规则是：一个人应该自我省察，发现他的恶，抵制这些恶；人好像出于自己那样去做，尽管它们出于主。事实上，这些在今时并没有成为福音；然而，它理应是福音；因为福音就是我们被主拯救。至于口头上的敬拜只有与生命相一致时才会被主接受，是因为人在上帝和他的众天使面前的言语乃是出于他对爱和信的喜爱之情而发声，而一个人里面的爱与信与他的生活是一致的。如果对上帝的爱和对他的信在你的生活中，你说话的声音就像鸽子。如果生活中充满了我欲和自负，那么说话的声音就像猫头鹰，不过你还是可以尝试模仿斑鸠的声音。属灵品质在声音之中，会影响发声。</p>

<h4 align="center">A Brief Exposition of New Church Doctrine (Stanley translation 1953) 52</h4>
<p>52. BRIEF ANALYSIS
<p>This is shown by experience. How many are there at this day who live according to the precepts of the Decalogue, and the other precepts of the Lord, from a religious principle? And how many are there at this day who desire to look their own evils in the face and perform actual repentance, and thus enter upon worship which is of the life? Or who, among those who practise piety, perform any other repentance than that of the mouth and speech, confessing themselves to be sinners, and praying from the doctrine of the Church that God the Father, Who from compassion on account of the Son Who suffered upon the cross for their sins, took away their damnation and atoned for them with His blood, would mercifully forgive their transgressions so that they might stand unspotted before His judgment-seat? Who does not see that this worship is of the lungs only, not of the heart thus, external, not internal? For in such worship a man prays for remission of sins, and yet is not conscious of a single sin in himself; and if he should know of any, he would envelop it with favour and indulgence, or with a faith supposedly purifying and absolving, without any works on his part. But this may be compared to a servant who, approaching his master with his face and clothes bedaubed with soot and filth, should say to him:
<p>"Master, wash me." Would not his master say to him: "Thou foolish servant, what are you saying? See, there is water, soap and a towel. Have you not hands, and can you not use them? Wash yourself." So also, would not the Lord God say: "There are from Me the means of purification; from Me also you have will and power. Wherefore, use these gifts of Mine and these talents of your own, and you will be purified."
<p>Consider also another example by way of illustration. Suppose you should pray a thousand times at home and in church that God the Father, for the sake of His Son, would preserve you from the devil, and yet you did not keep yourself from evil and so from the devil by that freedom of will in which you are perpetually kept by the Lord, you could not then be preserved even by legions of angels sent by the Lord. For the Lord cannot act contrary to His own Divine order, which is that a man should examine himself, discover his evils and resist them, and this as of himself, although from the Lord. This, indeed, does not appear at this day to be the gospel; nevertheless, it is so; for the gospel is that we are saved by the Lord.
<p>The reason why the worship of the mouth is accepted by the Lord only so far as it accords with worship which is of the life, is because man's speech before God and before His angels sounds from the affection of his love and faith, and these two are in man according to his life. Wherefore, if the love of God and faith in Him are in your life, the sound of your voice will be like that of a dove. But if self-love and self-confidence are in your life, the sound of your voice will be like that of an owl, however you may attempt to imitate the turtle-dove. The spiritual quality, which is within the sound, effects this. </p>

<p>52. BRIEF ANALYSIS. 
<p>This is testified by experience. How many are there at this day, who live according to the commandments of the Decalogue, and other precepts of the Lord, from religion? And how many are there at this day, who desire to look their own evils in the face, and to perform actual repentance, and thus enter upon the worship of the life? And who among those that cultivate piety, perform any other repentance than oral and oratorical, confessing themselves to be sinners, and praying, according to the doctrine of the church, that God the Father, for the sake of His Son, who suffered upon the cross for their sins, took away their damnation, and atoned for them with His blood, would mercifully forgive their transgressions, that so they might be presented without spot or blemish before the throne of His judgment? Who does not see, that this worship is of the lungs only, and not of the heart, consequently that it is external worship, and not internal? for he prays for the remission of sins, when yet he does not know one sin with himself; and if he did know of any, he would cover it over with favor and indulgence, or with a faith that is to purify and absolve him, without any works of his. But this is comparatively like a servant going to his master with his face and clothes defiled with soot and filth, and saying, Sir, wash me. Would not his master say to him, Thou foolish servant, what is it thou sayest? See! there is water, soap, and a towel, hast thou not hands, and ability to use them? wash thyself. Thus also the Lord God will say, The means of purification are from Me, and from Me also thou hast will and power, wherefore use these My gifts and talents, as thy own, and thou shalt be purified. Take another example by way of illustration. Suppose you should pray a thousand times at home and in temples, that God the Father, for the sake of His Son, would preserve you from the devil, and should not at the same time, from the freedom in which you are perpetually held by the Lord, keep yourself from evil, and so from the devil; you could not in this case be preserved even by legions of angels sent from the Lord; for the Lord cannot act contrary to His own Divine order, and His order is that man should examine himself, see his evils, resist them, and this as of himself, yet from the Lord.

The spiritual, which is within the sound, effects this. </p>

<p>52. BREVIS ANALYSIS.
<p>Hoc testatur experientia; quot hodie vivunt secundum praecepta Decalogi et reliqua Domini ex religione, et quot hodie volunt videre sua mala a facie, et actualem paenitentiam agere, et sic cultum vitae ingredi; et quis non, qui pietati studet, aliam paenitentiam agit, quam oralem et oratoriam, confitendo se esse peccatorem, ac precando ex doctrina Ecclesiae, ut Deus Pater ex misericordia propter Filium suum, Qui pro peccatis suis passus est crucem, sustulit illorum damnationem et expiavit sanguine suo, remittat sibi delicta sua, ut immaculatus sistatur coram throno judicii tui; quis non videt, quod hic Cultus sit solius pulmonis et non cordis, ita externus et non internus; orat enim de remissione peccatorum, et tamen non scit unum peccatum apud se; et si sciret, circumvelaret illud favore et indulgentia, aut fide purificante et absolvente absque ejus opera. Sed hoc comparative est sicut servus incedens facie et veste conspurcatis fuligine et stercore accederet ad herum suum, ac diceret, Domine ablue me; annon illi herus dicturus est, serve stulte, quid dicis, ecce ibi aqua, sapo, et linteum, suntne tibi manus et posse in illis, ablue teipsum: at Dominus Deus dicturus est, sunt media purificationis a Me, et quoque est tuum velle et tuum posse a Me, quare uteris illis meis donis et dotibus sicut tuis, et purificaberis. Sit adhuc exemplum illustrationi, si millies oraveris domi et in templis, ut Deus Pater propter Filium suum custodiat te a diabolo, et tu ipse non ex libero, in quo perpetuo teneris a Domino, a malo, ita a diabolo, temet custodiveris, non poteris per legiones Angelorum missas a Domino custodiri; Dominus enim non potest contra Divinum suum ordinem agere, ac Ipsius ordo est, ut homo exploret se, videat sua mala, resistat illis, et haec sicut ex se, tametsi ex Domino. Hoc quidem hodie non apparet sicut Evangelium sed usque est, nam Evangelium est salvari a Domino. Quod Cultus oris acceptus sit Domino secundum cultum vitae, est quia loquela hominis coram Deo et coram angelis sonat ex affectione amoris et fidei ejus, et haec duo insunt homini secundum vitam; quare si amor et fides Dei vitae tuae insunt, sonas sicut columba, at si amor et fiducia sui vitae tuae insunt, sonas sicut bubo, utcunque vocem flexeris ad imitamen vocis turturis; Spirituale, quod intus in sono est, hoc facit. </p>
