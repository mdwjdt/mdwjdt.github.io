<h3 align="center" class="ired">《新教会教义纲要》 第65节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>BE65.简要分析：除了直接怜悯而瞬时得救之外，今时所信的救恩再没有别的了，可由此明显看出：唯独信——仅凭嘴上说出，同时在气息上表现出的保证——而不伴随義，嘴上的信就变得真实，气息上的保证就变成发自内心之信，这被认为是完成拯救的全部工作。因为，如果取消了通过由人自己践行義举所实现的合作，那么所谓“信自身流入”的自发性合作就成为被动之举，这不过是毫无意义的空话。这样的话，除了这些张口即来的直接呼求——上帝啊，求你拯救我们！因着你儿子受难，他以自己的宝血将我从罪孽中洁净了，因而在你的宝座前，将我们表现为纯洁，正义和神圣——还需要其它什么吗？据说，如果这些话没有更早说出，即便在死前最后一刻的这么做也可以作为称义的种子。然而，直接凭怜悯就可瞬时得救如今是教会中一条飞行的火蛇，宗教因它而废止，并引入虚假的安全感，还将罚入地狱归咎于主（详情可参阅1764年在阿姆斯特丹出版的《圣治》一书第340节）。</p>

<h4 align="center">A Brief Exposition of New Church Doctrine (Stanley translation 1953) 65</h4>
<p>65. BRIEF ANALYSIS
<p>That no other salvation than that which is instantaneous from immediate mercy is believed in at this day is evident from this, that faith alone, which is of the mouth only, along with an assurance of the breath, unaccompanied by charity from which the faith of the mouth becomes real and the assurance of the breath becomes faith of the heart, is supposed to complete the whole work of salvation. For, if the co-operation which is effected through the exercise of charity by man as of himself is taken away, the spontaneous co-operation which is said to follow faith of itself becomes passive action. But this is frivolous talk. For what, then, is the need for more than this momentary and direct appeal: "Save me, O God, on account of the suffering of Thy Son, who has washed me from my sins in His own blood, and presents me pure, just and holy, before Thy throne"? And this utterance of the mouth, it is said, avails as a seed of justification even in the last hour of death, if it has not done so sooner. Instantaneous salvation from direct mercy is, however, at this day, a fiery flying serpent in the Church, and because of it religion is abolished, a false sense of security introduced, and damnation imputed to the Lord as may be seen in <a href="../dp/340.htm">n. 340</a> of the work on THE DIVINE PROVIDENCE, published at Amsterdam, in the year 1764. </p>

<p>65. BRIEF ANALYSIS. 
<p>That no other salvation is believed at this day, than instantaneous salvation from immediate mercy, is evident from this, that an oral faith alone, at the same time a confidence of the lungs, and not with charity at the same time, whereby oral faith becomes real, and the confidence of the lungs becomes that of the heart, is believed to complete all the work of salvation; for if the cooperation is taken away, which is effected through the exercises of charity by man as of himself, the spontaneous cooperation which is said to follow faith of itself, becomes passive action, which is a frivolous expression. For what need would there then be of anything more than this instantaneous and immediate prayer, "Save me, O God, for the sake of the sufferings of Thy Son, who hath washed me from my sins in His own blood, and presents me pure, just, and holy, before Thy throne"? And this ejaculation of the mouth might avail even at the hour of death, if not sooner, as a seed of justification. That nevertheless instantaneous salvation, from immediate mercy, is at this day a fiery flying serpent in the church, and that by it religion is abolished, security induced, and damnation imputed to the Lord, may be seen in the work concerning The Divine Providence, published at Amsterdam in the year 1764 (<a href="../dp/340.htm">Divine Providence 340</a>). </p>

<p>65. BREVIS ANALYSIS.
<p>Quod hodie non alia Salvatio quam momentanea ex immediata Misericordia credatur, constat ex eo, quod sola fides oralis et simul fiducia pulmonaris, et non simul charitas, ex qua fides oralis fit realis, ac fiducia pulmonaris fit cardiaca, omne opus salvationis absolvat; si enim aufertur cooperatio, quae fit per exercitia charitatis ab homine ut ab ipso, fit cooperatio spontanea sequens fidem ex se, actio passiva, quae est vox frivola; nam quid tunc pluribus opus est, quam hoc momentaneum et immediatum "Salva me Deus propter passionem Filii tui, Qui sanguine suo abluit me a peccatis meis, ac me purum, justum et sanctum sistit coram Throno tuo;" et quod hoc dictamen oris in ultima mortis hora, si non primis, ut semen justificationis, etiam valeat. Quod tamen Momentanea salvatio ex immediata Misericordia, sit hodie prester volans in Ecclesia, et quod per id aboleatur religio, inducatur securitas, et damnatio imputetur Domino, in Opere de Divina Providentia, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_summaria-expositio_65/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_340" target=_top>340</a>, Amstelodami Anno 1764 edito videatur. </p>
