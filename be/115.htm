<h4 align="center"></h4><p>BE115.另一个亲身见闻：有位天使曾对我说：“你想清楚了解什么是信与義，与義分离的信如何，与義联合的信又如何？我想给你一个形像的说明。”“有请！”我回答。“代替信与義，”他说：“请思考光与热，你将看得清楚。信，就本质而言，是与智慧相关的真理；義，就本质而言，是与爱相关的情感。在天上，智慧的真理就是光，爱的情感就是热。天使享受的光与热，本质上无非如此。由此你还能清楚看得出，与義分离或联合的信像什么。与義分离之信如同寒冬里的光，与義联合之信则如同春天里的光。寒冬季节的光，光中无热，与寒冷相连，彻底剥光树上的叶子，杀死小草，令土地坚硬水结冰。然而春天里的光，是与热相连的光，令树木生长，生出嫩叶，开花结果；还解封松软土地，长出小草、鲜花、灌木等植物，还使坚冰融化，泉水再次从源头流出。“信与義确实如此：与義分离之信令带来死亡，与義相合之信带来生机。在我们所在的灵界，这样带来死与生的情形能明明看见，因为在这里的信为光、義为热。哪里有義信相合，哪里就是乐园、花圃与草地。但是哪里義与信分离，那里寸草不生，唯一的绿色只是荆棘刺条所产生的。”不远处站着几位牧师，天使灵称他们为唯信的称义者和成圣者，还称他们为奥秘的师傅。我们将同样的内容告诉他们，还列举了充足的证据，以便让他们知道所说内容的真实。然而，当我们问他们：“是这样吗？”他们转身走开，说：“我们没听见。”于是我们提高嗓门向他们喊着说：“那请注意听。”可是他们伸手蒙着双耳，叫嚷着：“我们不想听。”结论：你当站在耶和华殿的门口、在那里宣传这话说、万军之耶和华、以色列的上帝如此说、你们改正行动作为、不要倚靠虚谎的话、说、这些是耶和华的殿、是耶和华的殿、是耶和华的殿（也就是教会）、你们偷盗、杀害、奸淫、起假誓、且来到这称为我名下的殿、说、我们可以自由了、你们是要行那些可憎的事吗、这殿岂为贼窝吗、我都看见了、这是耶和华说的耶利米书（7:2-4，9-11）。</p>

<p>115. The other memorable experience is as follows: <sup>1</sup>An angel once said to me, "You wish to see clearly what faith and charity are, and thus what faith is when separate from charity, and what it is when united with charity; I will demonstrate it to the sight." I replied, "Do so." And he said, "Instead of faith and charity, think of light and heat, and you will see this matter clearly. For faith in its own essence is the truth of wisdom, and charity in its own essence is the affection of love; and the truth of wisdom in heaven is light, and the affection of love in heaven is heat. The light and heat in which the angels dwell are nothing else. From this you can clearly see what faith is when separate from charity, and what it is when united with charity. Faith separate from charity is like the light of winter, and faith united with charity is like the light of spring. The light of winter, which is light separate from heat, because it is combined with cold, utterly strips the trees of all their leaves, kills the grass, hardens the ground, and freezes the water. But the light of spring, which is light combined with heat, causes the trees to vegetate, first into leaves, then into blossoms, and lastly into fruits. It opens and softens the ground that it may produce grass, herbs, flowers and fruits; and also dissolves the ice so that the waters flow from their sources. It is exactly similar with faith and charity. Faith separate from charity deadens all things, and faith combined with charity vivifies all things. This vivifying and deadening may be seen to the life in our spiritual world, because here faith is light, and charity is heat. For where faith is united with charity there are paradisaical gardens, flower-beds and shrubberies, delightful according to the union. But where faith is separate from charity there is not even grass, and what green there is, is from thorns and briars." Not far from us at that time were some of the clergy whom the angel called justifiers and sanctifiers of men by faith alone, also dealers in mysteries. We related the same things to them, giving them clear proof so that they might see that such was the case. Yet when we asked them whether it was not so, they turned away, saying, "We did not hear you." But we called out to them, saying, "Then hear us further." They then placed both hands over their ears, and cried out, "We will not hear." 
<p>CONCLUSION From <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_7_2.htm">Jeremiah 7:2-4</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_7_9.htm">9-11</a>: Stand in the gate of the house of Jehovah, and proclaim there this word... Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Amend your ways and your doings ...trust ye not in lying words, saying, The temple of Jehovah, the temple of Jehovah, the temple of Jehovah is here (that is, the church). Will ye steal, murder, commit adultery, and swear falsely...and after that come and stand before Me in this house, which is called by My name, and say, We are delivered: whilst ye do all these abominations? Is not this house become a den of robbers?... Even I, behold, I have seen, saith Jehovah.

<p>115. The Second Relation is this. An angel once said to me, "You wish to see clearly what faith and charity are, and thereby what faith is when separate from charity, and what it is when conjoined with charity; I will also demonstrate it to the eye." I replied, "Show it to me." And he said, "Instead of faith and charity, think of light and heat, and you will see clearly. For faith in its essence is the truth of wisdom, and charity in its essence is the affection of love, and the truth of wisdom in heaven is light, and the affection of love in heaven is heat; the light and heat which the angels have, are nothing else. Hence you can see clearly what faith is when separate from charity, and what it is when conjoined with charity. 
<p>"Faith separate from charity is like the light in winter, and faith conjoined with charity is like the light in spring; the light in winter, which is light separate from heat, and in consequence thereof conjoined with cold, strips the trees of all their leaves, kills the grass, hardens the earth and freezes the water; but the light in spring, which is light conjoined with heat, causes the trees to vegetate, first into leaves, then into blossoms, and lastly into fruits; it opens and softens the earth whereby it yields grass, herbs, flowers, and fruits; and it also dissolves the ice, so that the waters flow from their fountains. Exactly similar is the case with faith and charity; faith separate from charity deadens all things, and faith conjoined with charity vivifies all things. 
<p>"The nature of such deadening and vivifying may be seen to the life in our spiritual world, because here faith is light, and charity, heat; for where faith is conjoined with charity, there are paradisal gardens, flower beds, and lawns, in their pleasantness according to conjunction. But where faith is separate from charity, there does not grow even grass, nor any green thing, except it be on thorns and briers." There were then not far from us some of the clergy, whom the angel called justifiers and sanctifiers of men by faith alone, and also arcanists; we said to them the same things and likewise demonstrated them even so that they saw it to be so. But when we asked them whether it was so, they turned themselves away, and said, "We did not hear;" whereupon we cried aloud to them saying, "Hear us now, then;" but immediately they stopped their ears with both hands, and exclaimed, "We do not wish to hear." 
<p>CONCLUSION. 
<p>From Jeremiah <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_7_2.htm">7:2-4</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_7_9.htm">9-11</a>: 
<p>Stand in the gate of the house of Jehovah, and proclaim there this word: Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: Render good your ways and your words; trust ye not upon the words of a lie, saying, the temple of Jehovah, the temple of Jehovah, the temple of Jehovah is here [that is, the church]. Will ye steal, kill, commit adultery, and swear falsely, and after that come and stand before Me in this house, whereon My name is called, and say, we are delivered, whilst ye do all these abominations? Is not this house become a den of robbers? Even I behold, I have seen, saith Jehovah. </p>

<p>115. ALTERUM MEMORABILE est hoc: Quondam mihi dixit Angelus; vis videre clare quid Fides et Charitas, ita quid Fides separata e Charitate, et quid Fides conjuncta Charitati, et demonstrabo ad oculum; respondi, monstra; et dixit, cogita pro Fide et Charitate Lucem et Calorem, et clare videbis: Fides enim in sua essentia est Veritas quae Sapientiae, et Charitas in sua essentia est Affectio quae Amoris, ac Veritas Sapientiae in Caelo est Lux, et Affectio amoris in Caelo est Calor; Lux et Calor, in quibus sunt Angeli, non aliud sunt: exinde videre potes clare, quid Fides separata a charitate, et quid Fides conjuncta charitati. Fides separata a charitate est sicut Lux hyemalis, ac Fides conjuncta charitati est sicut Lux vernalis; Lux hyemalis, quae est Lux separata a Calore, quae quia est conjuncta frigori, prorsus denudat arbores, etiam a foliis, enecat gramen, indurat terram, et congelat aquas: Lux autem vernalis, quae est Lux conjuncta calori, vegetat arbores, primum in folia, tum in flores, et denique in fructus, aperit et emollit terram ut producat gramina, herbas, flores, et frutices, et quoque solvit glaciem, ut fluant e fontibus aquae: prorsus simile est cum Fide et Charitate; Fides separata a charitate mortificat omnia; et Fides conjuncta charitati vivificat omnia: Vivificatio haec, et Mortificatio illa, ad vivum possunt videri in Mundo nostro Spirituali, quia hic est Fides Lux et Charitas Calor; ubi enim Fides conjuncta charitati est, ibi sunt Horti paradisiaci, Floreta, et Vireta in sua amaenitate secundum conjunctionem: at ubi Fides separata a charitate est, ibi ne quidem gramen est, et ubi viride, est id ex vepribus et sentibus. Erant tunc non procul aliqui ex Clero, quos Angelus vocabat Justificatores et Sanctificatores hominum per solam fidem, et quoque Arcanistas; eadem haec diximus illis, et demonstravimus usque ut viderent quod ita sit; et cum quaesivimus, annon ita, averterunt se, et dixerunt, non audivimus; at clamavimus ad illos dicentes, audite itaque adhuc, tunc ponebant ambas manus ante aures suas, ac vociferati, non volumus audire.

<p>Sta in porta Domus Jehovae, et proclama ibi verbum hoc: sic dixit Jehovah Zebaoth Deus Israelis, bonas reddite vias vestras, et opera vestra, ne confidite vobis super verbis mendacii, dicendo, Templum Jehovae, Templum Jehovae, Templum Jehovae hic: (hoc est, Ecclesia): num furando, occidendo, et maechando, ac jurando per mendacium, deinde venietis et stabitis coram Me in Domo hac, super qua nominatur Nomen meum, et dicetis, erepti sumus, dum facitis omnes abominationes illas. Num Spelunca latronum facta est Domus haec: etiam Ego, ecce, vidi, dictum Jehovae. </p>
