<h3 align="center" class="ired">《新教会教义纲要》 第120节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>BE120.第三个灵界摘自《揭开启示》（AR961）亲身见闻：主许我见识诸天之中以及诸以下诸般奇事，我受命以此为任，将所见所闻传递给大众。以下是见闻之一：我看见壮丽的宫殿，中央是座大教堂。教堂当中有一金台，上面摆放一本圣经，两位天使侍立两侧。绕着金台有三排座位：第一排座位是以紫色的丝绸包着，第二排是蓝色丝绸，第三排是白色丝绸。屋顶下、金台之上，有华盖铺开，闪烁着宝石光芒，效果如同雨后碧空的彩虹一般。突然，一帮牧师出现，坐满了所有的座位；都照各自服事职分穿着圣袍。在教堂一边，有个橱柜，一名天使守卫着，橱柜中照着完美的次序排放着华丽的衣裳。
【2】这是主召集的一次会议。我听到天上有声音说：“开始讨论吧。”参会者问：“关于什么？”有声音说：“关于主和圣灵。”在他们准备去思考这些话题时，他们发现自己得不到启发。于是他们祷告，有光从天射下，先照亮他们的后脑，然后是太阳穴，最后照到他们脸上。于是他们开始，首先讨论主。讨论的第一点：谁在童女玛利亚中取了人的样式？金台边上的一位天使从台上拿起圣经向大家宣读《路加福音》中以下话：（天使对玛利亚说）你要怀孕生子、可以给他起名叫耶稣、他要为大、称为至高者的儿子、马利亚对天使说、我没有出嫁、怎么有这事呢、天使回答说、圣灵要临到你身上、至高者的能力要荫庇你、因此所要生的圣者必称为上帝的儿子（路加福音1:31，32，34，35）。然后天使又读《马太福音》（1:20-25）中相关话语，特别强调第25节的内容。除此之外，天使还从福音书中宣读了很多话，论到主在关于他的人方面被称为“上帝的儿子”，出于他的人，他称耶和华为他的“父”。天使还从先知书中宣读了预言耶和华自己要降世的话语，其中下面两节来自《以赛亚书》：到那日、人必说、看哪、这是我们的上帝、我们素来等候他、他必拯救我们、他是耶和华、我们素来等候他、我们必因他的救恩（原文是：拯救）欢喜快乐（以赛亚书25:9）；在旷野、有人声喊着说、当预备耶和华的路，在沙漠地修平我们上帝的道、耶和华的荣耀必然显现、凡有血气的必一同看见、主耶和华必像大能者临到、他必像牧人牧羊自己的羊群（以赛亚书40:3，5，10，11）。
【3】天使接着说：“由于是耶和华自己降到世间并取了人的样式显现，还藉此来拯救和救赎人类，因此在众先知书中，耶和华被称为救主和救赎主（拯救者和救赎者）。”于是，天使向众人宣读以下经文：上帝真在你们中间、此外再没有别的上帝、救主、以色列的上帝啊、你实在是自隐的上帝（以赛亚书45:14，15）；不是我耶和华吗、除了我以外、再没有上帝、我是公义的上帝、又是救主（以赛亚书45:21;22）；惟有我是耶和华、除我以外没有救主（以赛亚书43:11）；凡有血气必都知道我耶和华是你的救主、是你的救赎主（以赛亚书49:26;60:16）；我们救赎主的名是万军之耶和华、以色列的圣者（以赛亚书47:4）；他们的救赎主大有能力，万军之耶和华是他的名（耶利米书50:34）；耶和华、我的磐石、我的救赎主啊（诗篇19:14）；耶和华、你们的救赎主、以色列的圣者如此说、我是耶和华、你的上帝（以赛亚书48:17，43:14，49:7，54:8）；耶和华、你是我们的父、从万古以来、你名称为我们的救赎主（以赛亚书63:16）；从你出胎、造就你的救赎主耶和华如此说、我耶和华是创造万物的、是独自铺张诸天、铺开大地的、谁与我同在呢（以赛亚书44:24）；耶和华、以色列的君、以色列的救赎主、万军之耶和华如此说、我是首先的、我是末后的、除我以外再没有上帝（以赛亚书44:6）；万军之耶和华是他的名、救赎你的是以色列的圣者、他必称为全地的上帝（以赛亚书54:5）；看哪、日子将到、我要给大卫兴起一个公义的苗裔、他必掌王权、他的名必称为、耶和华我们的义（耶利米书23:5，6，33:15，16）；那日、耶和华必作全地的王、那日、耶和华为独一无二、他的名也是独一无二的（撒迦利亚书14:9）。
【4】有这些经文作为支持，在座的牧师们一致声明，是耶和华自己取了人的样式，为的是拯救和救赎人类。正在那时，躲藏在教堂角落的一些天主教徒发声问：“父耶和华怎么能变成人？他不是宇宙的创造者吗？“坐在第二排有一牧师转过去说：“那么是谁呢？“天主教徒从角落传出话来，说：“万世之先的子！”他得到回复：“照你所说，万世之先的子，不也是宇宙的创造者吗？什么是万世之先所生的子或上帝呢？具有独一性且不可分割性的神性本体如何分开，只是其中一部分、而不是全部降世取了人的样式？”
【5】关于主，要讨论的第二点：父与主是否如同灵魂与身体那样合为一体？众牧师说这是顺理成章的事，因为灵魂自父而来。然后，坐在第三排的一位牧师背诵了《亚他尼修信经》中关于这方面的内容：彼（我们的主耶稣基督、上帝之子）虽为上帝、亦为人，然非为二、乃为一基督、合为一、非由二性相混、乃由位格为一、如灵与身成为一人、上帝与人成了为一基督、。背诵这些内容的牧师声称这是包括天主教在内的整个基督教界普遍接受的信经。于是所有人说：“还需要什么呢？父上帝和主合为一，正如灵魂与身体合为一。”他们接着说：“正因如此，我们看出，主之人是神性的，因为这是耶和华之人。还领会到，我们必须直接转向神性之人的这位主，因为这是让我们能接近父上帝的唯一途径。”
【6】天使从圣经中引用大量经文来支持他们的结论，其中包括：有一婴孩为我们而生、有一子赐给我们、他名称为奇妙策士、全能的上帝、永恒的父、和平的君”（以赛亚书9:6）；亚伯拉罕虽然不知道我们、以色列也不承认我们、你却是我们的父、耶和华啊、你是我们的父、众万古以来、你名称为我们的救赎者（以赛亚书63:16）；耶稣说、信我的、乃是信那差我来的、人看见我、就是看见那差我来的那位（约翰福音12:44，45）；腓力对（耶稣）说、求主将父显给我们看、耶稣对他说、人看见我、就是看见了父、你怎么说、将父显给我们看呢、我在父里面、父在我里面，你不信吗、相信我、我在父里面、父在我里面（约翰福音14:8-11）；耶稣说、我就是道路、真理、生命、若不藉着我、没有人能到父到里去（约翰福音14:6）。听完这些，所有的参会者都同心同意地认为，主之人是神性的，必须通过接近他来接近父，因为耶和华——就是万世之先的主——通过这个人将自己引入世间，使他自己在世人眼前成为可见，因而可被接近。耶和华上帝在古时同样也以人形使自己在世人眼前成为可见与可接近，只不过那时是借着一位天使来完成。
【7】接下来的主题是关于圣灵。首先揭露了许多人对父、子、圣灵各为上帝的观念，就好像父上帝高高在上，子在父的右手边，他们差遣圣灵出去启发和指教世人。不过，然后听到天上有声音说：“我们无法忍受这样的思维观念。谁不知道耶和华上帝是全在的？若知道并承认这一点，也应当承认是他自己启发并教导世人，并没有一位居间的上帝，不同于他，更别说不同于其它两个，就像两个人互不相同那样。因此，去除先前的观念吧，那是徒然的。接收正确的观点，你们将会清楚这一点。”
【8】躲在教堂角落的天主教徒又发声说：“如果这样，那圣经中福音书作者与保罗所写的圣灵又是怎么一回事呢？何况还有那么多博学的神职人员，尤其我们天主教中的，他们都宣称被圣灵引导。现今有哪个基督徒会否认圣灵及其运行呢？”听到这些庆，坐在第二排的牧师有一位转过头对他们说：“圣灵是来自主耶和华的神性之进行。你们所说的圣灵自身是一位，并且自身就是上帝。不过，若不是发出的活动，那么什么是一位出自另一位并由其发出呢？一位不能出自、并从另一位发出，但活动可以。或者说，除非是神性的发出和进行，什么又是一位上帝出自、并由上帝发出？一位上帝不能出自并由另一位、经由第三位发出，不过神性可以。”
【9】听到这些，在坐的牧师们全体一致得出结论：圣灵自身并非独立的一位，或者凭自身并非上帝，而是出自独一的、全在的上帝——也就是主——的神性之发出和进行。站在摆放圣经的金台两侧的天使听到这些话，说：“好！你们读旧约，不会读到哪里提到众先知受圣灵感动而说出圣经的话语，而是来自主耶和华；新约中提到“圣灵”，皆指神性之进行，用来启发、指教、生动、改造和更新。”
【10】之后，关于圣灵的另一个讨论的话题：称为“圣灵”的神性之进行是从称为“父”的神性本体还是称为“子”的神性之人发出？当他们正讨论这个话题时，天上照下一道光使他们看出：被称为“圣灵”的神性之进行乃是由主里面的神性、经由他的已被荣化之人——也就是神性之人——发出，就好比一个人的所有活动乃是由他里面的灵魂、经由身体发出。站在金台旁的一位天使从圣经引用以下经文来证实这个结论：上帝（父）所差来的就说上帝的话、因为上帝赐圣灵给他是无限量的、父爱子、已将万有交在他手里（约翰福音3:34，35）；从耶西的本（原文是墩）必发一条、耶和华的灵必住在他里面、就是使他有智慧和聪明的灵、谋略和能力的灵、（以赛亚书11:1，2）；耶和华的灵赐给他并在他里面（以赛亚书42:1，59:19，21，61:1，路加福音4:18）；他从父那里差圣灵来（约翰福音15:26）；他（圣灵）必荣耀我、因为他要将受于我的告诉你们、凡父所有的、都是我的、所以我说、他要将受于我的告诉你们（约翰福音16:14，15）；我若去、就差他（保惠师）来（约翰福音16:7）；保惠师就是圣灵（约翰福音14:26）；那时还没有圣灵、因为耶稣尚未得着荣耀（约翰福音7:39）；（在主被荣耀之后，他）就向他们（众门徒）吹了一口气、说、你们受圣灵（约翰福音20:22）。
【11】因为主的神性之活动和他的神性之全在以“圣灵”来象征性表示，所以当他跟门徒们说起父上帝要差来的圣灵时，还说：我不撇下你们为孤儿、我去还要到你们这里来、到那日、你就知道我在我父里面、你们在我里面、我在你们里面（约翰福音14:18，28，20）；在他离世之前，他说：我就常与你们同在、直到时代的末了*（马太福音28:20）。读完这些经文后，这位天使说：“从以上经文，还有圣经其它很多地方，可明显看出被称为‘圣灵’的神性乃是由主里面的神性本身经由他的神性之人发出。”在坐的众牧师一致反应说：“这才是神性的真理。”
【12】最后，牧师们达成以下的共识：“通过本次会议的讨论，我们清楚地看到并认可这神圣的真理：主耶稣基督之中有圣三一——被称为‘父’的源头之神性、被称为‘子’的神性之人、被称为‘圣灵’的神性之进行。因而教会之中只有这一位上帝。”
【13】当这些议程在本次盛大的会议得到总结后，参会者们起身。看守衣橱的天使上前来，将柜中的衣裳赐给在坐每一位牧师，这些华贵的衣裳到处有金线的编织，这天使还说：“请接受婚筵的礼服吧。”然后他们被光荣地接入全新的基督徒之天，该天将与世上主的教会——就是新耶路撒冷——相联合。那日、必是耶和华所知道的、不是白昼、也不是黑夜、到了晚上才有光明、那日，必有活水从耶路撒冷出来、耶和华必作全地的王、那日耶和华必为独一无二的、他的名也是独一无二的（撒迦利亚书14:7，8，9）。（全书结束）</p><br><p align="center"><a href="119.htm">上一节</a>　 <a href="0.htm">目录</a></p><hr />
<h4 align="center">A Brief Exposition of New Church Doctrine (Stanley translation 1953) 120</h4>
<p>120. The third Memorable Experience from THE APOCALYPSE REVEALED. <sup>1</sup>As I have been permitted by the Lord to see the wonderful things which are in the heavens and under the heavens, I am obliged, as commanded, to describe what I have seen. There appeared a magnificent palace with a temple in its innermost part. In the middle of the temple stood a table of gold, on which lay the Word; and two angels stood beside it. Round about the table was a triple row of seats. The seats of the first row were covered with a silken cloth of crimson those of the second row with a silken cloth of blue and those of the third row with a white cloth. Below the roof, high above the table, appeared a canopy of tapestry, shining with precious stones, from whose lustre there shone forth, as it were, a rainbow, as when the sky is clear after rain. Then suddenly there appeared sitting on the seats a number of the clergy clothed in the garments of their priestly office. On one side was a wardrobe, where stood an angel custodian, and within the wardrobe lay splendid vestments in beautiful order.</p>
<p>[2] It was a Council convened by the Lord; and I heard a voice from heaven saying, "Deliberate." But they said, "On what?" The reply was, "Concerning the Lord the Saviour, and concerning the Holy Spirit." But when they thought on these subjects they were not in a state of illumination wherefore they made supplication, and immediately light streamed down out of heaven, first illuminating the back part of their heads, afterwards their temples, and lastly their faces. Then they began deliberating as commanded; first, concerning the Lord the Saviour. The first question to be considered was Who assumed the Human in the Virgin Mary? And the angel standing at the table on which was the Word read these words from Luke in their presence: The angel said to Mary, Behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son, and thou shalt call His name Jesus. He shall be great, and shall be called The Son of the Highest.... And Mary said to the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man? And the angel answering said, The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee; therefore, also, that Holy Thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_1_31.htm">Luke 1:31-32</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_1_34.htm">34-35</a>.
<p>Then he also read from the first chapter of Matthew, verses 20-25, and when he came to the 25th verse he read it with a loud voice. In addition he read many passages from the Evangelists, as <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_3_17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_17_5.htm">17:5</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_20_31.htm">John 20:31</a>; with other statements where the Lord as to His Human is called the Son of God, and where, from His Human, He calls Jehovah His Father. Further, he read from the Prophets, where it is foretold that Jehovah Himself was about to come into the world; among them were these passages from Isaiah:
<p>It shall be said in that day, Lo This is our God, for Whom we have waited to deliver us; this is Jehovah, for Whom we have waited; let us rejoice and be glad in His salvation. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_25_9.htm">Isaiah 25:9</a>.
<p>The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of Jehovah; make level in the desert a pathway for our God.... And the glory of Jehovah shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together.... Behold, the Lord Jehovah cometh in strength.... He shall feed His flock like a shepherd. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_40_3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_40_5.htm">5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_40_10.htm">10-11</a>.</p>
<p>[3] Then the angel said, "As Jehovah Himself came into the world and assumed a Human, and by it has redeemed and saved mankind, therefore He is called by the Prophets the Saviour and the Redeemer. And then he read to them the following passages:
<p>Surely God is in thee, and there is no God else. Verily Thou art a hidden God, O God of Israel the Saviour. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_45_14.htm">Isaiah 45:14-15</a>.
<p>Am not I Jehovah, and there is no God else besides Me? A just God and there is no Saviour besides Me? <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_45_21.htm">Isaiah 45:21</a>.
<p>I am Jehovah, and besides me there is no Saviour. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_43_11.htm">Isaiah 43:11</a>.
<p>I am Jehovah thy God.., and thou shalt acknowledge no God besides Me; and there is no Saviour besides Me. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_13_4.htm">Hosea 13:4</a>.
<p>That all flesh may know that I Jehovah am thy Saviour and thy Redeemer. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_49_26.htm">Isaiah 49:26</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_60_16.htm">60:16</a>.
<p>As for our Redeemer, Jehovah of hosts is His name. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_47_4.htm">Isaiah 47:4</a>.
<p>Their Redeemer, the mighty Jehovah of Hosts is His name. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_50_34.htm">Jeremiah 50:34</a>.
<p>Jehovah, my Rock and my Redeemer. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_19_14.htm">Psalm 19:14</a>.
<p>Thus saith Jehovah thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel, I am Jehovah thy God. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_48_17.htm">Isaiah 48:17</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_43_14.htm">43:14</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_49_7.htm">49:7</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_54_8.htm">54:8</a>.
<p>Thou, Jehovah, art our Father; our Redeemer from of old is Thy name. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_63_16.htm">Isaiah 63:16</a>.
<p>Thus saith Jehovah thy Redeemer...I am Jehovah that maketh all things...and by Myself alone. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_44_24.htm">Isaiah 44:24</a>.
<p>Thus saith Jehovah, the king of Israel, and His Redeemer, Jehovah of Hosts; I am the First and the Last, and besides Me there is no God. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_44_6.htm">Isaiah 44:6</a>.
<p>Jehovah of Hosts is His name, and thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; the God of the whole earth shall He be called. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_54_5.htm">Isaiah 54:5</a>.
<p>Behold, the days come when I will raise unto David a righteous Branch Who shall reign a king ...and this is His name, Jehovah our Righteousness. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_23_5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5-6</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_33_15.htm">33:15-16</a>.
<p>In that day Jehovah shall be King over all the earth in that day there shall be one Jehovah, and His name One. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_14_9.htm">Zechariah 14:9</a>.</p>
<p>[4] From all these passages, those who sat on the seats were convinced, and unanimously declared, that Jehovah Himself assumed the Human to redeem and save mankind. But then a voice was heard from the Roman Catholics who had hidden themselves behind the altar, saying, "How could Jehovah, the Father, become a man? Is He not the Creator of the universe?" And one of those who sat on the second row of seats turned round and said, "Who was it, then?" Then the one from behind the altar, advancing to its side, replied, "The Son from eternity." But he was answered: "Is not the Son from eternity, according to your own confession, also the Creator of the universe? And what is a Son, or a God, born from eternity? And how is it possible for the Divine Essence, which is one and indivisible, to be separated, and for one part to descend and not at the same time the whole?"</p>
<p>[5] The other matter of enquiry concerning the Lord was: Whether the Father and He are One, as the soul and the body are one? They said that this follows of necessity because the soul is from the father. Then one of those who sat on the third row of seats read out of the Confession of Faith, called the Athanasian Creed, the following passage: Although our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is God and man...yet they are not two, but one Christ...one altogether ... by unity of Person. For as the soul and body are one man, so God and man is one Christ. "This faith," said the reader, "is received throughout the whole Christian world, even by the Roman Catholics." Then they said, "What need have we of further proof? God the Father and He are one, as the soul and body are one." And they continued, "Because this is so, we perceive that the Lord's Human is Divine, for it is the Human of Jehovah also that the Lord ought to be approached as to His Divine Human, and that thus and not otherwise can the Divine, which is called the Father, be approached."</p>
<p>[6] This conclusion of theirs the angel confirmed by many passages from the Word, among them were these from Isaiah:
<p>Unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given ...Whose name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, God, Hero, Father of Eternity, Prince of Peace. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_9_6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>.
<p>Abraham knows us not, and Israel does not acknowledge us. Thou, Jehovah, art our Father, our Redeemer from of old is Thy name. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_63_16.htm">Isaiah 63:16</a>, 
<p>And in John:
<p>Jesus said, He that believeth on Me ...believeth on Him that sent Me. And he that seeth Me, seeth him that sent Me. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_12_44.htm">John 12:44-45</a>. Philip said to Jesus, Show us the Father ...Jesus said to him, He that hath seen Me hath seen the Father how sayest thou then, Show us the Father? Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in Me? Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father in Me. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_8.htm">John 14:8-11</a>.
<p>Jesus said, I and the Father are one. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_10_30.htm">John 10:30</a>.
<p>All things that the Father hath are Mine ...and all Mine are the Father's. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_16_15.htm">John 16:15</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_17_10.htm">17:10</a>.
<p>Lastly:
<p>Jesus said, I am the Way, the Truth and the Life; no one cometh to the Father, but by Me. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_6.htm">John 14:6</a>.
<p>When they had heard these statements, they all declared with one voice and heart that the Lord's Human is Divine, and that this should be approached in order that the Father may be approached; since Jehovah God, Who is the Lord from eternity, sent Himself by this means into the world, and made Himself visible to men's eyes, and thus accessible. Likewise, He made Himself visible and thus accessible to men of olden times in a human form, but then by means of an angel.</p>
<p>[7] After this followed a discussion concerning the Holy Spirit. First the idea held by many people regarding God the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit was disclosed, which was this; that God the Father sat on high, with the Son at His right hand, and that they sent forth the Holy Spirit from themselves to enlighten and instruct mankind. But then a voice was heard from heaven saying, "We cannot endure such an idea. Who does not know that Jehovah God is omnipresent? And whoever knows and acknowledges this, should also acknowledge that it is He Himself who enlightens and instructs, and that there is not a mediating God distinct from Him, much less from two, as one person is distinct from another. Wherefore, let the former idea which is false be removed, and let this other idea which is sound be received, and then you will see this clearly."</p>
<p>[8] But then a voice was heard again from the Roman Catholics who had concealed themselves behind the altar of the temple, saying, "What then is the Holy Spirit, who is mentioned in the Word by the Evangelists and Paul, and by whom so many of the learned among the clergy, particularly of our Church, profess to be led? Who in the Christian world at this day denies the Holy Spirit and His operations?" Upon this, one of those who were sitting on the second row of seats turned round and said, "You say that the Holy Spirit is a Person by Himself, and a God by Himself. But what is a person going forth and proceeding from a person but operation going forth and proceeding? One person cannot go forth and proceed from another by another, but operation canon Or what is a God going forth and proceeding from a God but the Divine going forth and proceeding? One God cannot go forth and proceed from another by another, but the Divine canon Is not the Divine Essence one and indivisible? And since the Divine Essence, or the Divine Esse, is God, is not God therefore one and indivisible?"</p>
<p>[9] On hearing these words, those who sat on the seats concluded unanimously that the Holy Spirit is not a Person by Himself, thus not a God by Himself, but that it is the Holy Divine going forth and proceeding from the one and only omnipotent God, Who is the Lord. To this the angels who stood at the golden table on which lay the Word said, "Good; for it is nowhere written in any part of the Old Testament that the prophets spake the Word from the Holy Spirit, but from Jehovah, the Lord; and wherever the Holy Spirit is mentioned in the New Testament it signifies the Divine Proceeding, which enlightens, instructs, vivifies, reforms and regenerates.</p>
<p>[10] After this another subject of enquiry respecting the Holy Spirit was raised, viz., From Whom proceeds the Divine which is called the Holy Spirit, from the Divine which is called the Father or from the Divine Human which is the Son? Whilst they discussed this, a light shone from heaven, whereby they saw that the Holy Divine, meant by the Holy Spirit, proceeds from the Divine in the Lord through His glorified Human, which is the Divine Human, comparatively as all activity with man proceeds from the soul through the body. This truth the angel who stood by the table confirmed by these passages:
<p>He Whom the Father hath sent speaketh the words of God; He hath not given the spirit by measure unto Him. The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into His hand. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_34.htm">John 3:34-35</a>.
<p>There shall come forth a Rod out of the stem of Jesse...the Spirit of Jehovah shall rest upon Him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_11_1.htm">Isaiah 11:1-2</a>.
<p>The Spirit of Jehovah was put upon Him, and was in Him. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_42_1.htm">Isaiah 42:1</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_59_19.htm">59:19</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_59_21.htm">21</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_61_1.htm">61:1</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_4_18.htm">Luke 4:18</a>. When the Holy Spirit shall have come, whom I am about to send unto you from the Father. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_26.htm">John 15:26</a>.
<p>He shall glorify Me, for He shall receive of Mine, and shall declare it unto you. All things that the Father hath are Mine; wherefore I said, He is about to receive of Mine and to declare it unto you. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_16_14.htm">John 16:14-15</a>.
<p>If I go away I will send the Comforter unto you. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_16_7.htm">John 16:7</a>.
<p>The Comforter is the Holy Spirit. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_26.htm">John 14:26</a>.
<p>The Holy Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_7_39.htm">John 7:39</a>.
<p>But after the glorification: Jesus breathed on His disciples and said, Receive ye the Holy Spirit. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_20_22.htm">John 20:22</a>.
<p>And in the Revelation:
<p>Who shall not glorify Thy name, O Lord, for Thou only art holy. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_15_4.htm">Revelation 15:4</a>.</p>
<p>[11] Inasmuch as the Divine operation of the Lord from His Divine Omnipresence is meant by the Holy Spirit, therefore when He spoke to His disciples concerning the Holy Spirit, which He was about to send from God the Father, He also said:
<p>I will not leave you orphans...I go away...and come to you.... In that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in Me, and I in you. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_18.htm">John 14:18</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_28.htm">28</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_20.htm">20</a>.
<p>And just before His departure out of the world He said:
<p>Lo I am with you all the days, even to the consummation of the age. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_28_20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>.
<p>Having read these words in their presence, the angel said, "From these and many other passages from the Word it is evident that the Divine which is called the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Divine in the Lord through His Divine Human. To this those who sat on the seats exclaimed, "This is Divine truth."</p>
<p>[12] Lastly, this decision was made: From what has been deliberated in this council we clearly see, and therefore acknowledge as holy truth, that in the Lord God, the Saviour Jesus Christ, there is a Divine Trinity which is the Originating Divine, called the Father, the Divine Human which is the Son, and the Divine Proceeding which is the Holy Spirit. Then they exclaimed together: In Jesus Christ dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/colossians_2_9.htm">Colossians 2:9</a>. Thus, there is One God in the Church.</p>
<p>[13] After these things were concluded in that magnificent council, they arose, and the angel-custodian of the wardrobe came and brought to each of those who had sat on the seats splendid garments interwoven here and there with threads of gold; and he said, "Receive ye these wedding garments." They were then conducted in glory to the New Christian Heaven, with which the Lord's Church on earth, which is the New Jerusalem, will be united. 
<p>There shall be one day which is known to Jehovah, nor day nor night...for about evening-time it shall be light. It shall come to pass in that day, living waters shall go out from Jerusalem... and Jehovah shall be King over all the earth in that day there shall be one Jehovah, and His name one. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_14_7.htm">Zechariah 14:7-9</a>.
<p>THE END </p><h4 align="center">A Brief Exposition of New Church Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 120</h4>
<p>120. The Third Relation from The Apocalypse Revealed. Since it has been given me by the Lord to see the wonderful things which are in the heavens and below the heavens, I must, from command, relate what has been seen. There appeared a magnificent palace, and in its inmost a temple. In the midst of the latter was a table of gold, upon which was the Word, beside which two angels were standing. Around it were seats in three rows: the seats of the first row were covered with silken cloth of a purple color; the seats of the second row, with silken cloth, of a blue color; and the seats of the third row, with white cloth. Under the roof, high above the table, there appeared a widespread canopy, shining with precious stones, from the splendor of which there shone forth as it were a rainbow, as when heaven clears up after a shower. 
<p>There then suddenly appeared a number of the clergy, occupying all the seats, clothed in the garments of their priestly office. At one side was a wardrobe, where an angel keeper stood; and within there lay splendid garments in beautiful order. It was a Council convoked by the Lord; and I heard a voice from heaven, saying, "Deliberate." But they said, "Upon what?" It was said, "Concerning the Lord the Savior and concerning the Holy Spirit." But when they thought upon these subjects, they were not in enlightenment; wherefore they supplicated, and then light descended from heaven, which first illumined the back part of their heads, and afterwards their temples, and at length their faces: and then they began; and, as it was commanded, first, concerning the Lord the Savior. The first question proposed and discussed was, "Who assumed the Human in the Virgin Mary," And an angel standing at the table upon which was the Word, read before them these words in Luke: 
<p>The angel said to Mary, Behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and shalt bring forth a Son, and shalt call His name Jesus; He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Most High. And Mary said to the angel, How shall this be, since I know not a man? And the angel answering said, The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee; and the power of the Most High shall overshadow thee; whence the Holy One that is born of thee shall be called the Son of God (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_1_31.htm">Luke 1:31-32</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_1_34.htm">34-35</a>). 
<p>As also what is in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_1_20.htm">Matthew 1:20-25</a>; and what is in verse 25 there he read emphatically. Besides these, he read many things from the Evangelists, as <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_3_17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>; and <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_17_5.htm">Matthew 17:5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_20_31.htm">John 20:31</a>; and elsewhere, where the Lord as to His Human is called "the Son of God," and where He from His Human calls Jehovah His "Father," as also from the Prophets, where it is foretold that Jehovah Himself would come into the world; among which also are these two in Isaiah: 
<p>It shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God, whom we have waited for, that He may free us; this is Jehovah, whom we have waited for; let us exult and rejoice in His salvation (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_25_9.htm">Isaiah 25:9</a>). 
<p>The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, prepare ye the way for Jehovah, make straight in the desert a highway for our God: for the glory of Jehovah shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together: Behold the Lord Jehovih cometh in strength; He shall feed His flock as a shepherd (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_40_3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_40_5.htm">5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_40_10.htm">10</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_40_11.htm">11</a>).
<p>And the angel said, "Since Jehovah Himself came into the world, and assumed the Human, and thereby saved and redeemed men, He is therefore called the Saviour' and the Redeemer' in the prophets." And then he read before them these passages following: 
<p>Surely God is in thee, and there is no God besides; verily Thou art a hidden God, O God of Israel the Saviour (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_45_14.htm">Isaiah 45:14-15</a>). 
<p>Am not I Jehovah? and there is no God else besides Me, a just God and a Saviour, there is none besides Me (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_45_21.htm">Isaiah 45:21-22</a>). 
<p>I am Jehovah, and besides Me there is no Saviour (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_43_11.htm">Isaiah 43:11</a>). 
<p>I Jehovah am thy God, and thou shalt acknowledge no God beside Me, and there is no Saviour besides Me (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_13_4.htm">Hosea 13:4</a>). 
<p>That all flesh may know that I Jehovah am thy Saviour, and thy Redeemer (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_49_26.htm">Isaiah 49:26</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_60_16.htm">60:16</a>). 
<p>As for our Redeemer, Jehovah of Hosts in His name (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_47_4.htm">Isaiah 47:4</a>). 
<p>Their Redeemer is strong, Jehovah of Hosts is His name (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_50_34.htm">Jeremiah 50:34</a>). 
<p>O Jehovah my Rock and my Redeemer (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_19_14.htm">Psalm 19:14</a>). 
<p>Thus said Jehovah thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel, I Jehovah am thy God (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_48_17.htm">Isaiah 48:17</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_43_14.htm">43:14</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_49_7.htm">49:7</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_54_8.htm">54:8</a>). 
<p>Thou O Jehovah art our Father, our Redeemer, Thy name is from an age (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_63_16.htm">Isaiah 63:16</a>). 
<p>Thus said Jehovah thy Redeemer, I am Jehovah that maketh all things, and alone by Myself (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_44_24.htm">Isaiah 44:24</a>). 
<p>This said Jehovah King of Israel, and His Redeemer Jehovah of Hosts, I am the First and the Last, and besides Me there is no God (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_44_6.htm">Isaiah 44:6</a>). 
<p>Jehovah of Hosts is His name, and thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel, the God of the whole earth shall He be called (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_54_5.htm">Isaiah 54:5</a>). 
<p>Behold, the days come, that I will raise up unto David a just Branch who shall reign King, and this is His name, Jehovah our Justice (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_23_5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5-6</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_33_15.htm">33:15-16</a>). 
<p>In that day shall Jehovah be King over all the earth; in that day shall Jehovah be one; and His name One (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_14_9.htm">Zechariah 14:9</a>). 
<p>Being confirmed from all these passages, those that sat upon the seats said unanimously that Jehovah Himself assumed the Human to redeem and save men. But there was then heard a voice from the Roman Catholics, who had hid themselves behind the altar, saying, "How can Jehovah the Father become Man? is He not the Creator of the universe?" And one of them that sat upon the seats of the second row turned himself, and said, "Who then?" And he behind the altar answered, "The Son from eternity." But he received for answer, "Is not the Son from eternity, according to your confession, the Creator of the universe also? And what is a Son or a God born from eternity? And how can the Divine essence, which is one and indivisible, be separated, and some of it descend and take on the Human, and not at the same time the whole?" 
<p>The second discussion concerning the Lord was, whether God the Father and He thus are one, as the soul and the body are one? They said that this is a consequence, because the soul is from the Father. And then one of those who sat upon the seats in the third row, read from the Creed which is called Athanasian these words: "Although our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is God and Man, still they are not two, but one Christ; yea, He is altogether one, He is one Person; since as the soul and the body make one man, so God and Man are one Christ." The reader said that this faith is received in the whole Christian world, even by the Roman Catholics. And they then said, "What need is there of more? God the Father and He are one, as the soul and the body are one." And they said, "As it is so, we see that the Lord's Human is Divine, because it is the Human of Jehovah; then that the Lord as to the Divine Human is to be approached; and that thus and not otherwise can the Divine which is called the Father be approached." This conclusion of theirs the angel confirmed by many more passages from the Word, among which were these in Isaiah: 
<p>Unto us a Boy is born, unto us a Son is given, whose name is Wonderful, Counsellor, God, Hero, the Father of eternity, the Prince of peace (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_9_6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>). 
<p>In the same: 
<p>Abraham hath not known us, and Israel doth not acknowledge us; Thou, O Jehovah, art our Father, our Redeemer, from everlasting is Thy name (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_63_16.htm">Isaiah 63:16</a>). 
<p>And in John: 
<p>Jesus said, He that believeth in Me, believeth in Him that sent Me, and He that seeth Me seeth Him who sent Me (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_12_44.htm">John 12:44-45</a>). 
<p>Philip said unto Jesus, Show us the Father; Jesus saith unto him, He that seeth Me seeth the Father; how sayest thou then, show us the Father? Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in Me? Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father in Me (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_8.htm">John 14:8-11</a>). 
<p>Jesus said, I and the Father are one (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_10_30.htm">John 10:30</a>). 
<p>Then: 
<p>All things which the Father hath are Mine, and all Mine are the Father's (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_16_15.htm">John 16:15</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_17_10.htm">17:10</a>). 
<p>And lastly this: 
<p>Jesus said, I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life; no one cometh to the Father but by Me (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_6.htm">John 14:6</a>). 
<p>On hearing these, they all said with one voice and heart, that the Lord's Human is Divine, and that this is to be approached that the Father may be approached; since Jehovah God, who is the Lord from eternity, through it sent Himself into the world, and made Himself visible to the eyes of men, and thus accessible. Likewise He made Himself visible to the eyes of men, and thus accessible in the human form to the ancients, but then through an angel. 
<p>After this followed the deliberation concerning the Holy Spirit. And first was disclosed the idea of many respecting God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, which was as if God the Father was sitting on high, and the Son at His right hand, and they were sending forth the Holy Spirit from them, to enlighten and teach men. But a voice was then heard from heaven, saying, "We cannot endure that idea of thought. Who does not know that Jehovah God is omnipresent? He who knows and acknowledges this, will also acknowledge that He Himself enlightens and teaches; and that there is not an intermediate God, distinct from Him, and still less from two, as one person from another. Therefore let the former idea, which is vain, be removed; and let this which is just be received; and you will see this clearly." But a voice was then heard again from the Roman Catholics, who had hid themselves behind the altar of the temple, saying, "What then is the Holy Spirit, who is named in the Word in the Evangelists and in Paul, by whom so many of the learned men from the clergy, especially from ours, say that they are led? Who in the Christian world at this day denies the Holy Spirit and its operation?" At this one of those who were sitting upon the second row of seats, turned himself and said, "You say that the Holy Spirit is a Person by Himself and a God by Himself. But what is a person going forth and proceeding from a person, but operation going forth and proceeding? One person cannot go forth and proceed from another through a third, but operation can. Or what is a God going forth and proceeding from a God, but the Divine going forth and proceeding? One God cannot go forth and proceed from another through a third, but the Divine can. Is not the Divine Essence one and indivisible? And as the Divine Essence or the Divine Esse is God, is not God one and indivisible?" On hearing these things, they who sat upon the seats concluded unanimously that the Holy Spirit is not a Person by itself, nor a God by itself; but that it is the Holy Divine going forth and proceeding from the Only Omnipresent God, who is the Lord. At this the angels that stood by the golden table upon which was the Word, said, "It is well. We do not anywhere read in the Old Testament, that the prophets spoke the Word from the Holy Spirit, but from Jehovah the Lord; and where the Holy Spirit' is mentioned in the New Testament, the proceeding Divine is meant, which is the Divine enlightening, teaching, vivifying, reforming, and regenerating." After this there followed another discussion concerning the Holy Spirit, which was, From whom does the Divine which is called the Holy Spirit proceed? is it from the Divine which is called the Father, or from the Divine Human which is called the Son? And when they were discussing this, the light shone on them from heaven, from which they saw that the Holy Divine, which is meant by the Holy Spirit, proceeds from the Divine in the Lord through His glorified Human, which is the Divine Human, comparatively as all activity proceeds from the soul through the body with man. This the angel standing at the table confirmed from the Word by these passages: 
<p>He whom the Father hath sent, speaketh the words of God; He hath not given the Spirit by measure unto Him; the Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into His hand (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_34.htm">John 3:34-35</a>). 
<p>There shall come forth a Rod out of the stem of Jesse, the Spirit of Jehovah shall rest upon Him, the Spirit of wisdom and Intelligence, the Spirit of counsel and might (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_11_1.htm">Isaiah 11:1-2</a>). 
<p>That the Spirit of Jehovah was given upon Him, and that it was in Him (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_42_1.htm">Isaiah 42:1</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_59_19.htm">59:19- 20</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_61_1.htm">61:1</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_4_18.htm">Luke 4:18</a>). 
<p>When the Holy Spirit shall come, which I will send unto you from the Father (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_26.htm">John 15:26</a>). 
<p>He shall glorify Me, for He shall receive of mine, and announce it unto you: all things that the Father hath are mine; therefore I said that He shall receive of mine, and announce it unto you (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_16_14.htm">John 16:14, 15</a>). 
<p>If I go away, I will send the Comforter unto you (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_16_7.htm">John 16:7</a>). 
<p>The Comforter is the Holy Spirit (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_26.htm">John 14:26</a>). 
<p>The Holy Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_7_39.htm">John 7:39</a>). 
<p>After the glorification, Jesus breathed on them, and said to the disciples, Receive ye the Holy Spirit (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_20_22.htm">John 20:22</a>). 
<p>And in the Apocalypse: 
<p>Who shall not glorify Thy name, O Lord? for Thou alone art holy (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_15_4.htm">Revelation 15:4</a>). 
<p>Since the Lord's Divine operation from His Divine omnipresence is meant by the Holy Spirit, therefore when He spoke to the disciples concerning the Holy Spirit which He would send from God the Father, He also said: 
<p>I will not leave you orphans; I go away, and come unto you: and in that day ye shall know that I am in My Father, and ye in Me, and I in you (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_18.htm">John 14:18</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_20.htm">20</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_28.htm">28</a>). 
<p>And just before His departure out of the world, He said: 
<p>Lo, I am with you all the days until the consummation of the age (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_28_20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>). 
<p>Having read these words before them, the angel said, "From these and many other passages in the Word, it is manifest that the Divine which is called the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Divine in the Lord through His Divine Human." To this they that sat upon the seats said, "This is the Divine truth." 
<p>At length this decision was made, "That from the deliberations in this Council we have clearly seen, and thence acknowledge as the holy truth, that in the Lord God the Saviour Jesus Christ there is a Divine Trinity, which is the Divine from which, that is called the Father; the Divine Human, which is the Son; and the proceeding Divine, which is the Holy Spirit, crying out, That in Jesus Christ dwelleth all the fullness of the Divinity bodily (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/colossians_2_9.htm">Colossians 2:9</a>). Thus there is one God in the church." 
<p>After these things were concluded in that magnificent Council, they rose up: and the angel keeper of the wardrobe came and brought to each of those who sat upon the seats, splendid garments interwoven here and there with threads of gold, and said, "Receive these wedding garments." And they were conducted in glory into the New Christian Heaven, with which the Lord's church on earth, which is the New Jerusalem, will be conjoined. 
<p>There shall be one day which is known to Jehovah, not day nor night, but about the time of evening it shall be light. It shall come to pass in that day that living waters shall go forth from Jerusalem. And Jehovah shall be King over all the earth; in that day Jehovah shall be one, and His name one (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_14_7.htm">Zechariah 14:7-9</a>). 
<p>THE END. </p><h4 align="center">Summaria Expositio 120 (original Latin 1769)</h4>
<p>120. TERTIUM MEMORABILE EX APOCALYPSI REVELATA. Quoniam a Domino datum est mihi videre Mirabilia, quae in Caelis et sub Caelis sunt, ex mandato me oportet memorare quod visum est. Visum est Palatium magnificum, et in ejus intimo Templum; in medio hujus erat Mensa ex auro, super qua erit Verbum, cui adstabant bini Angeli: circum illam erant Solia in triplici ordine; Solia primi ordinis erant obtecta panno holoserico purpurei coloris; Solia Secundi ordinis panno holoserico caerulei coloris; et Solia tertii ordinis panno albo. Sub tecto alte supra Mensam apparuit Aulaeum expansum, fulgens ex lapidibus pretiosis, e quorum splendore effulsit sicut Iris cum serenatur Caelum post pluviam. Subito tunc visi sunt totidem ex Clero sedentes super Soliis, omnes induti veste Ministerii sacerdotalis. Ad unum latus erat Cimeliarchium, ubi stetit Angelus custos, et inibi in pulchro ordine jacebant Vestes splendidae.

Ex his et illis sedentes super soliis confirmati unanimiter dixerunt, quod Ipse Jehovah assumserit Humanum ad redimendum et salvandum homines. Sed tunc audita est vox ex Romano Catholicis, qui occultaverant se post Altare, dicens, quomodo potest Jehovah Pater Homo fieri, estne Creator universi; et convertit se unus ex Sedentibus super soliis secundi ordinis, et dixit, Quis tunc; et ille post Altare tunc stans juxta Altare respondit, FILIUS AB AETERNO; sed responsum tulit, estne Filius ab aeterno secundum vestram Confessionem etiam Creator universi; et quid Filius aut Deus natus ab aeterno; et quomodo potest Divina Essentia, quae est Una et Individua, separari, ac unum ejus descendere, et non simul Totum. ALTERA VENTILATIO DE DOMINO ERAT, Annon sic Pater et Ipse unum sunt, sicut Anima et Corpus unum sunt; dixerunt quod hoc consequens sit, quia a Patre est Anima. Tunc unus ex illis, qui sedebant super soliis in tertio ordine, legebat ex Symbolica Fide, quae Athanasiana vocatur, haec "Tametsi noster Dominus Jesus Christus Filius Dei est Deus et Homo, usque non sunt duo, sed est unus Christus, imo est prorsus Unus, est UNA PERSONA; QUONIAM SICUT ANIMA ET CORPUS FACIUNT UNUM HOMINEM, ITA DEUS ET HOMO EST UNUS CHRISTUS:" dixit Legens, quod haec Fides recepta sit in Universo Christiano Orbe, etiam a Romano-Catholicis: et dixerunt, quid pluribus opus est, sunt Deus Pater et Ipse unum, sicut Anima et Corpus unum sunt: et dixerunt, quia ita est, videmus quod Humanum Domini sit Divinum, quia est Humanum Jehovae; tum quod Dominus quoad Divinum Humanum adeundus sit, et quod sic et non aliter adiri possit Divinum quod Pater vocatur. Hoc illorum Conclusum confirmavit Angelus per plura ex Verbo, inter quae fuerunt haec; apud Esajam "Puer natus est nobis, Filiis datus est nobis, Cujus Nomen, Mirabilis, Consiliarius, DEUS, Heros, PATER AETERNITATIS, Princeps pacis," <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_summaria-expositio_120/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_9_5" target=_top>9:5</a>. apud Eundem "Abraham non cognoscit nos, et Israel non agnoscit nos, TU JEHOVAH PATER NOSTER, REDEMPTOR NOSTER A SAECULO NOMEN TUUM," <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_summaria-expositio_120/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_63_16" target=_top>63:16</a>. Et apud Johannem "JESUS DIXIT, qui credit in Me, credit in Ipsum qui misit Me, et qui VIDET ME, VIDET IPSUM, Qui MISIT ME, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_summaria-expositio_120/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_12_44-45" target=_top>Johannes 12:44-45</a>. Dixit Philippus ad Jesum, monstra nobis Patrem, dicit illi Jesus, QUI VIDIT ME VIDIT PATREM, quomodo ergo tu dicis, monstra nobis Patrem nonne credis quod EGO IN PATRE ET PATER IN ME; CREDITE MIHI QUOD EGO IN PATRE, ET PATER IN ME, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_summaria-expositio_120/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_14_8-9" target=_top>Johannes 14:8-9</a>.

His auditis, dixerunt omnes uno ore et corde, quod Humanum Domini sit Divinum, et quod Hoc adeundum sit, ut adeatur Pater; quoniam Jehovah Deus, Qui est Dominus ab aeterno, per Illud se misit in Mundum, et se fecit Visibilem oculis hominum, et sic accessibilem: pariter fecit se visibilem et sic accessibilem in Forma Humana Antiquis, sed tunc per Angelum.
<p>Post haec sequebatur Deliberatio de SPIRITU SANCTO: et primum detecta est plurium idea de DEO PATRE, FILIO, ET SPIRITU SANCTO, quae erat, sicut Deus Pater sederet in alto, et Filius ad dextram Ejus, et a se emitterent Spiritum Sanctum ad illustrandum et docendum homines. At tunc audita est vox e Caelo, dicens, non sustinemus illam cogitationis ideam; quis non scit, quod Jehovah Deus sit Omnipraesens; qui hoc scit et agnoscit, etiam agnoscet, quod Ipse illustret et doceat, et quod non sit Deus medians, distinctus ab Ipso, et minus a duobus, ut Persona a Persona; quare removeatur prior idea, quae est vana, et recipiatur haec, quae est justa, et videbitis hoc clare. Sed tunc iterum audita est vox a Romano Catholicis, qui se post Altare Templi occultaverant, dicens, quid tunc est SPIRITUS SANCTUS, qui in Verbo nominatur apud Evangelistas, et apud Paulum, a Quo tot docti e Clero, imprimis a nostro, se dicunt duci; quis hodie in Christiano Orbe Spiritum Sanctum, et ejus operationes negat: ad haec convertit se unus ex illis qui super soliis secundi ordinis sedebant, et dixit; vos dicitis quod Spiritus Sanctus sit Persona per se, et Deus per se; sed quid est persona exiens et procedens a persona, nisi operatio exiens et procedens; non potest una persona ex altera per alteram exire et procedere, sed operatio potest; aut quid est Deus exiens et procedens a Deo, nisi Divinum exiens et procedens, non potest unus Deus ab altero per alterum exire et procedere, sed Divinum potest: estne Divina Essentia una et individua, et quia Divina Essentia, seu Divinum Esse est Deus, estne Deus unus et individuus. His auditis sedentes super soliis unanimiter concluserunt, quod Spiritus Sanctus non sit Persona per se, ita nec Deus per se, sed quod sit Sanctum Divinum exiens et procedens ex Unico Deo Omnipraesente, Qui est Dominus. Ad haec dixerunt Angeli stantes ad Mensam auream, super qua erat Verbum, BENE; non legitur ullibi in Veteri Foedere, quod Prophetae loquuti sint Verbum ex Spiritu Sancto, sed ex Jehovah Domino; et ubi in Novo Foedere dicitur Spiritus Sanctus, intelligitur Divinum procedens, quod est Divinum illustrans, docens, vivificans, reformans et regenerans. Post haec successit altera Ventilatio de SPIRITU SANCTO, quae erat, a Quo procedit Divinum, quod vocatur Spiritus Sanctus, num ex Divino quod Pater vocatur, vel ex Divino Humano quod Filius: et cum hoc ventilabant, affulsit Lux e Caelo, ex qua viderunt, quod Sanctum Divinum, quod intelligitur per Spiritum Sanctum, procedat ex Divino in Domino per Ipsius Humanum glorificatum, quod est Divinum Humanum; comparative sicut omne Activum procedit ex Anima per Corpus apud hominem. Hoc Angelus stans ad Mensam confirmavit per haec "Ille, Quem misit Pater, verba Dei loquitur, NON EX MENSURA DEDIT ILLI SPIRITUM; Pater amat Filium, et omnia dedit in manum Ipsius, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_summaria-expositio_120/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_3_34-35" target=_top>Johannes 3:34-35</a>.

His coram illis lectis, dixit Angelus, ex his et pluribus aliis ex Verbo, patet, quod Divinum, quod vocatur Spiritus Sanctus, procedat ex Divino in Domino per Divinum Humanum Ipsius. Ad haec sedentes super soliis dixerunt, Hoc est DIVINA VERITAS.
<p>Demum factum est Decretum, hoc: Quod ex deliberatis in hoc Concilio clare viderimus, et inde pro Sancta Veritate agnoscamus, quod in Domino Deo Salvatore Jesu Christo sit Divina Trinitas, quae est, Divinum a Quo quod vocatur Pater, Divinum Humanum quod est Filius, et Divinum procedens quod est Spiritus Sanctus: conclamantes, Quod IN JESU CHRISTO OMNIS PLENITUDO DIVINITATIS HABITET CORPORALITER, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_summaria-expositio_120/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_colossians_2_9" target=_top>Colossenses 2:9</a>. Ita est Unus Deus in Ecclesia.
<p>Postquam haec in Magnifico illo Concilio conclusa sunt, surrexerunt, et venit Angelus custos ex Cimeliarchio, et apportabat cuivis ex illis, qui super soliis consederunt, Vestes splendidas, hic et ibi intertextas filis aureis, et dixit, accipite VESTES NUPTIALES. Et deducti sunt in gloria in Novum Caelum Christianum, cum quo Ecclesia Domini in Terris, quae est Nova Hierosolyma, conjuncta erit.
