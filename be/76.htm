<h3 align="center" class="ired">《新教会教义纲要》 第76节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>BE76.这样的灾难，或者真理被诸谬所侵扰，在启示录中有七章论及这方面内容。这也是羔羊所揭印之小书卷中出来黑马和灰马所代表的意义（6:5-8），还有从无底坑上来与两个见证人交战并杀死它们的兽（11:7）；那个龙也代表如此，它站在那将要生产的妇人面前，等她生产之后，要吞吃她孩子的，然后追逐她到旷野，从口中吐出水来，像河一样，要将妇人冲去（第12章）；同样，从海里上来的兽，形状像豹，脚像熊的脚，口像狮子的口（13:2）；还有三只污秽的灵，好像青蛙，从龙口、兽口并假先知的口中出来（16:13）。这层意义还用以下具体内容来描述：在七位天使将盛着上帝大怒的七碗（碗里头是七灾）倒在地上、海里、江河与众水的泉源上，还倒在日头、兽的座位上、幼发拉底大河上，最后倒在空中，于是发生自从地上有人以来从没见过的大地震（第16章）。地震代表教会的颠倒，皆因诸谬以及对真理的歪曲所造成。这层意义还以这些话来表达：那天使就把镰刀扔在地上、收取了地上的葡萄、丢在上帝忿怒的大酒榨中、那酒榨踹在城外、就有血从酒榨里流出来、高到马的嚼环、远有六百里（原文是：一千六百司他町）（启示录14:19，20）。这里的“血”象征被歪曲之理。在那七章中还有诸多类似的事情。如果你愿意，可查阅当中的解释，还有那几章解经末尾的附录见闻。</p>

<h4 align="center">A Brief Exposition of New Church Doctrine (Stanley translation 1953) 76</h4>
<p>76. This affliction, or infestation of truth by falsities, is treated of in seven chapters of the Revelation. It is what is meant by the black and the pale horses going forth out of the book, the seals of which the Lamb had opened (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_6_5.htm">Revelation 6:5-8</a>) also by the beast ascending out of the abyss, which made war against the two witnesses and slew them (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_11_7.htm">Revelation 11:7</a>, etc.); again, by the dragon which stood before the woman who was ready to be delivered in order to devour her child, and pursued her into the wilderness, and there cast out of his mouth water as a flood that it might swallow her up (chapter <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_12_1.htm">12</a>); likewise, by the beast out of the sea, whose body was like that of a leopard, his feet like those of a bear, and his mouth like that of a lion (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_13_2.htm">Revelation 13:2</a>); further, by the three spirits like frogs which came out of the mouth of the dragon, out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_16_13.htm">Revelation 16:13</a>). The same is meant by these particulars; that after the seven angels had poured out the vials of the wrath of God, in which were the seven last plagues, upon the earth, upon the sea, upon the rivers and fountains, upon the sun, upon the throne of the beast, upon Euphrates, and last of all upon the air, there was a great earthquake such as had never been seen since men were made upon the earth (chapter <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_16_1.htm">16</a>). An earthquake signifies an inversion of the Church, which is brought about by falsities and falsifications of truth. Similar things are meant by these words:
<p>The angel put forth his sickle . . . and gathered the vine of the earth, and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of God; and the winepress was trodden. . . and blood came out . . . even to the horses' bridles, for the space of a thousand and six hundred furlongs. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_14_19.htm">Revelation 14:19-20</a>.
<p>Blood signifies truth falsified. Many other things besides are meant in those seven chapters. But consult, if you will, the expositions, and the memorabilia at the end, of those chapters. </p>

<p>76. This affliction, or infestation of truth by falsities, is treated of in seven chapters of Revelation, and is what is meant by: 
<p>The black horse and the pale horse going forth from the book, the seals whereof the Lamb had opened (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_6_5.htm">Revelation 6:5-8</a>). 
<p>Then: 
<p>By the beast ascending out of the abyss, which made war against the two witnesses, and slew them (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_11_7.htm">Revelation 11:7</a>). 
<p>As also by: 
<p>The dragon which stood before the woman who was ready to be delivered, in order to devour her offspring, and pursued her into the desert, and there cast out of his mouth water as a flood, that he might swallow her up. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_12_2.htm">Revelation 12:2-6</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_12_15.htm">15</a> 
<p>And likewise by: 
<p>The beast out of the sea, the body of which was like that of a leopard, his feet like those of a bear, and his mouth like that of a lion (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_13_2.htm">Revelation 13:2</a>). 
<p>Also by: 
<p>The three unclean spirits like frogs, which came out of the mouth of the dragon, out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_16_13.htm">Revelation 16:13</a>). 
<p>And moreover by these particulars, that: 
<p>After the seven angels had poured out the vials of the wrath of God, wherein were the seven last plagues, upon the earth, upon the sea, upon the rivers and fountains, upon the sun, upon the throne of the beast, upon Euphrates, and at length upon the air, there was a great earthquake, such as had not been since men were created upon the earth (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_16_1.htm">Revelation 16:1-21</a>). 
<p>"The earthquake" here signifies an inversion of the church, which is effected by falsities and falsifications of truth. The like things are meant by these: 
<p>The angel sent in his sickle, and gathered the vineyard of the earth, and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of God; and the winepress was trodden, and blood came out even unto the horses' bridles, for a thousand and six hundred stadia (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_14_19.htm">Revelation 14:19, 20</a>). 
<p>There "blood" signifies truth falsified: besides many other things in those seven chapters. But see, if you will, the explanations, and the Relations at the end of the chapters. </p>

<p>76. De hac Afflictione seu infestatione veri a falsis, actum est in septem Capitibus in Apocalypsi; illa est quae intelligitur per Equum nigrum, et per Equum pallidum, exeuntes ex Libro, cujus Sigilla Agnus aperuit, Cap. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_summaria-expositio_76/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_6_5-8" target=_top>6:5-8</a>. Tum, per Bestiam ascendentem ex abysso, qui fecit bellum cum binis testibus, et occidit illos, Cap. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_summaria-expositio_76/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_11_7" target=_top>11:7</a>, seq. Ut et per Draconem, qui stetit coram Muliere paritura ut foetum ejus devoraret, et persequutus illam in desertum, et ibi ex ore suo ejecit aquam ut flumen, ut absorberet illam, Cap. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_summaria-expositio_76/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_12_1-18" target=_top>12</a>. Et quoque per Bestiam ex mari, quae corpore similis erat pardo, pedibus urso, ac ore leoni, Cap. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_summaria-expositio_76/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_13_2" target=_top>13:2</a>. Tum per tres Spiritus similes ranis, qui ex ore draconis, ex ore bestiae, et ex ore pseudoprophetae, exiverunt, Cap. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_summaria-expositio_76/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_16_13" target=_top>16:13</a>. Ac insuper per haec, Quod postquam septem Angeli effuderant phialas irae Dei, in quibus erant septem plagae ultimae, in terram, in mare, in fluvios et fontes, in solem, in thronum bestiae, in Euphratem, et tandem in aerem, factus sit terrae motus magnus, qualis non fuerat, ex quo homines facti sunt in terra, Cap. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_summaria-expositio_76/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_16_1-21" target=_top>16</a>; Terrae motus significat Ecclesiae inversionem, quae fit per falsa et falsificationes veri. Similia intelliguntur per haec "Misit Angelus falcem, et vindemiavit vineam terrae, et conjecit in torcular irae Dei magnum et calcatum est torcular, et exivit sanguis usque ad fraena equorum a stadiis mille sexcentis," Cap. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_summaria-expositio_76/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_14_19-20" target=_top>14:19-20</a>; Sanguis significat falsificatum verum; praeter plura in septem illis Capitibus; videte, si lubet, Explicationes, et Memorabilia post illa Capita. </p>
