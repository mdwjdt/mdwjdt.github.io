<h3 align="center" class="ired">《新教会教义纲要》 第16节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>BE16.新教会教义概述。接下来对《启示录》第21-22章“新耶路撒冷”所象征的新教会的教义进行简要概述。新教会的教义不仅是信仰的教义，还是生活的教义，在著作中被分为三部分。第一部分：1.主上帝拯救者，神性的三一集于他。2.圣经，属世和属灵两层意义，由圣经产生的神圣。3.对上帝的爱，对邻舍的爱，二者的一致。4.信，信与两种爱的连接。5.由十诫而来生活的教导。6.改造与更新。7.自由意志，人与主的配合。8.受洗。9.圣餐。10.天与地狱。11.人与天或人与地狱的连接，人照此连接于死后的生命状态。12.永生。第二部分：1.世代的终结，或当前教会的结束。2.主的降临。3.最后的审判。4.新教会或新耶路撒冷。第三部分指明当今教会与新教会在教义上的分歧。我们在此说明其中某些分歧，因为牧师和平信徒认为当今教会处于福音及其真理的真光照耀下，不可能被反驳、推翻和攻击，哪怕从天降下的天使也不能。当今教会也看不见除此以外的任何东西，因为它的知性能力已退离信仰，却已经借助知性能力以下的某种眼光来确证它的各样教条，因为伪谬在这样的眼光中甚至能被确证，看似真理；在那里被确证的伪谬获得一种虚幻的光照，真理之光在这虚幻之光下如同幽暗。正因如此，我们在此需要加以讨论，将分歧提出来，用简洁的话语来说明这些分歧，以至于知性能力尚未被迷信或盲信完全关闭者首先能在曙光下朦胧看出这些分歧，然后能在晨光之中看清，最终通过著作本身，犹如在正午亮光下明白一切。这些分歧如下所示。</p>

<h4 align="center">A Brief Exposition of New Church Doctrine (Stanley translation 1953) 16</h4>
<p>16. A SKETCH of the DOCTRINALS OF THE NEW CHURCH.
<p>Now follows a brief Exposition of the Doctrine of the New Church, meant by the New Jerusalem in the Revelation, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_21_1.htm">chapters 21</a>-<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_22_1.htm">22</a>. This Doctrine, which is not only a matter of faith but also of life, will be divided in the major work <sup>1</sup>into three parts.
<p>THE FIRST PART will treat of:
<p>(1) The Lord God the Saviour, and the Divine Trinity in Him.
<p>(2) The Sacred Scripture and its two senses, the Natural and the Spiritual, and its holiness thence.
<p>(3) Love to God and love towards the neighbour, and the agreement of these loves with each other.
<p>(4) Faith, and its conjunction with those two loves.
<p>(5) The Doctrine of Life, from the Commandments of the Decalogue.
<p>(6) Reformation and Regeneration.
<p>(7) Free-will, and man's co-operation with the Lord by its means.
<p>(8) Baptism.
<p>(9) The Holy Supper.
<p>(10) Heaven and Hell.
<p>(11) The conjunction of men therewith, and the state of their life after death according to that conjunction.
<p>(12) Eternal life.
<p>THE SECOND PART will treat of:
<p>(1) The Consummation of the of Age, or end of the present Church.
<p>(2) The Coming of the Lord.
<p>(3) The Last Judgment.
<p>(4) The New Church, which is the New Jerusalem.
<p>THE THIRD PART will point out the disagreements between the tenets of the present Church and those of the New Church. But we will dwell a little upon these now, because it is believed both by the clergy and the laity that the present Church is in the very light of the Gospel and its truths, which cannot possibly be disproved, overturned or assailed, not even by an angel, if one should descend from heaven. Neither does the present Church see otherwise, because it has withdrawn the understanding from faith, and yet has confirmed its tenets by a kind of sight beneath the understanding; for in that sight falsities can be confirmed until they appear as truths, and falsities there confirmed acquire a fallacious light in which the light of truth appears as thick darkness. For this reason, we shall here dwell a little upon this subject, mentioning the disagreements and illustrating them by brief remarks, so that those whose understanding has not been closed by blind faith may see these differences in a kind of twilight, afterwards as in morning light, and at length, in the major work, as in full daylight. The disagreements in general are as follows:
<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong>

<p>16. A SKETCH OF THE DOCTRINALS OF THE NEW CHURCH. 
<p>There now follows a brief Exposition of the Doctrine of the New Church, which is meant by the New Jerusalem in Revelation (chaps. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_21_1.htm">21</a> and <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_22_1.htm">22</a>). This doctrine, which is not only a doctrine of faith, but also of life, will be divided in the work itself into three parts. 
<p>THE FIRST PART will treat: 
<p>I. Of the Lord God the Saviour, and of the Divine Trinity in Him. 
<p>II. Of the Sacred Scripture, and its Two Senses, the Natural and the Spiritual, and of its Holiness thence derived. 
<p>III. Of Love to God, and Love towards our Neighbor, and of their Agreement. 
<p>IV. Of Faith, and its Conjunction with those Two Loves. 
<p>V. The Doctrine of Life from the Commandments of the Decalogue. 
<p>VI. Of Reformation and Regeneration. 
<p>VII. Of Free-Will, and Man's Co-operation with the Lord thereby. 
<p>VIII. Of Baptism. 
<p>IX. Of the Holy Supper. 
<p>X. Of Heaven and Hell. 
<p>XI. Of Man's Conjunction therewith, and of the State of Man's Life after Death according to that Conjunction. 
<p>XII. Of Eternal Life. 
<p>THE SECOND PART will treat: 
<p>I. Of the Consummation of the Age, or End of the present Church. 
<p>II. Of the Coming of the Lord. 
<p>III. Of the Last Judgment. 
<p>IV. Of the New Church, which is the New Jerusalem. 
<p>THE THIRD PART will point out the Disagreements between the dogmas of the present church, and those of the New Church. But we will dwell a little upon these now, because it is believed both by the clergy and laity, that the present church is in the light itself of the Gospel and in its truths, which cannot possibly be disproved, overturned, or controverted, not even by an angel if one should descend from heaven: neither does the present church see any otherwise, because it has withdrawn the understanding from faith, and yet has confirmed its dogmas by a kind of sight beneath the understanding, for falsities may there be confirmed even so as to appear like truths; and falsities there confirmed acquire a fallacious light, before which the light of truth appears as thick darkness. For this reason we shall here dwell a little upon this subject, mentioning the disagreements, and illustrating them by brief remarks, that such as have not their understanding closed by a blind faith, may see them as at first in twilight, and afterwards as in morning light, and at length, in the work itself, as in the light of day. The disagreements in general are as follows. </p>
<h4 align="center">Summaria Expositio 16 (original Latin 1769)</h4>
<p>16. SCIAGRAPHIA DOCTRINALIUM NOVAE ECCLESIAE.
<p>I. Sequitur nunc summaria Expositio Doctrinae Novae Ecclesiae, quae per Novam Hierosolymam in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_summaria-expositio_16/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_21_1-27" target=_top>Apocalypsi 21</a> Cap. et <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_summaria-expositio_16/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_22_1-21" target=_top>22</a> intelligitur: haec Doctrina, quae non modo est fidei sed etiam vitae, in ipso Opere. dispescetur in Tres Partes.
<p>PRIMA PARS docebit I. De Domino Deo Salvatore, et de Divina Trinitate in Ipso.
<p>II. De Scriptura Sacra, et de utroque ejus Sensu, Naturali et Spirituali, ac de Sanctitate ejus inde. III. De Amore in Deum, et de Amore erga proximum, et de Concordantia illorum. IV. De Fide, et ejus Conjunctione cum binis illis amoribus. V. Doctrina vitae ex praeceptis Decalogi. VI. De Reformatione et Regeneratione. VII. De Libero Arbitrio, et de Cooperatione hominis cum Domino per illud. VIII. De Baptismo. IX. De Sancta Caena. X. De Caelo et Inferno. XI. De Conjunctione hominum cum illis, et de statu vitae illorum post mortem secundum conjunctionem. XII. De Vita Aeterna.
<p>SECUNDA PARS aget I. De Consummatione Saeculi, seu fine Ecclesiae hodiernae. II. De Adventu Domini. III. De Ultimo Judicio. IV. De Nova Ecclesia, quae est Nova Hierosolyma.
<p>TERTIA PARS demonstrabit DISCORDANTIAS dogmatum Ecclesiae hodiernae et Ecclesiae novae. Sed circa has hic aliquantum morabimur, ex causa quia creditur a Clero et a Laico, quod Ecclesia hodierna sit in ipsa luce Evangelii, ac in ejus veritatibus, quae infirmari, convelli et impugnari nequeunt, ne quidem ab Angelo, si quis e Caelo descenderet: Ecclesia hodie nec videt aliud, quia subtraxit intellectum a fide, et usque dogmata confirmavit per quendam visum sub intellectu, ac falsitates ibi possunt confirmari, usque ut appareant sicut veritates, ac falsitates ibi confirmatae faenerantur lucem fallacem, coram qua lux veritatum apparet sicut caligo. Propter hanc causam hic aliquantum morabimur, Discordantias adducendo, et illas per breves notas illustrando, ut illae coram Intellectu per caecam fidem non occluso videantur sicut in luce crepusculi, et deinde matutae, et demum in ipso Opere in die. Discordantiae in genere sunt hae. </p>
