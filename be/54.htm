<h3 align="center" class="ired">《新教会教义纲要》 第54节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>BE54.简要分析：教会的领袖们坚持理性应当屈从于信仰；他们甚至声称，对未知之信（其实是盲目或盲从的）才是正确的信仰。这是第一个似是而非的东西。因为信属于理，理属于信；为了使理可以属于信，它必须在自身的光中并在那光中被看见；要不然，错谬的东西也能被信。从这种信仰引发出似是而非的东西有很多，列举如下：父上帝在万世之前生了圣子，圣灵从两者发出，三者之中的每一个自身都是一位并且是上帝；主无论灵魂还是身体都是从母亲而来；创造了宇宙的这三位（因而是三位上帝）当中的一位为了使人类与父和好并借此拯救人类降世并呈现为人；因恩典而获得此信并认同这些似是而非内容的那些人通过将他的公义归算、运用并转移给他们自己而得救；在初次接受此信时，人就像个雕像、木桩或石头一样，这样的信仅需通过听道而流入；唯独信是得救的途径，无需律法的行为，并且它与義（charity）没什么关系；在没有事先悔改的情况下，这样的信能引起罪得赦免；一个不思悔改之人单凭罪得赦免便可称义、重生和成圣；后来的義，好行为和革新自然而然跟随而来。此外还有很多诸如此类的东西，都从基于三位上帝观念的教义大量涌出，如同从不正当关系的床榻非法所生的私生子女。</p>

<h4 align="center">A Brief Exposition of New Church Doctrine (Stanley translation 1953) 54</h4>
<p>54. BRIEF ANALYSIS
<p>The prelates of the Church insist that the understanding is to be kept under obedience to faith; nay, they say that a faith in what is unknown, which is a blind or nocturnal faith, is properly faith. This is the first paradox. For faith belongs to truth, and truth to faith; and, in order that truth may belong to faith, it must be in its own light and be seen in that light; otherwise, what is false could be believed.
<p>The paradoxes proceeding from such a faith are many; as, that God the Father begat a Son from eternity, and the Holy Spirit proceeds from both, and each of these three is a Person by Himself and is God; that the Lord was from the mother both as to His soul and body; that these three Persons, thus three Gods, created the universe that one of them descended and assumed the Human in order to reconcile the Father, and thus to save mankind; that those who by grace obtain faith and believe these paradoxes are saved by the imputation, application and transfer of His justice to themselves; that a man, at his first reception of this faith, is like a statue, stock or stone, and that faith flows in by the mere hearing of the Word; that faith alone is the means of salvation without the works of the law, and that it is not formed from charity; that it produces remission of sins without previous repentance; that from remission of sins alone an impenitent man is justified, regenerated and sanctified; that afterwards charity, good works and renewal follow spontaneously besides many similar things which, like offspring generated from an illegitimate bed, have all issued from the doctrine founded on the idea of three Gods. </p>

<p>54. BRIEF ANALYSIS. 
<p>The rulers of the church insist, that the understanding is to be kept under obedience to faith, yea that faith, properly speaking, is a faith in what is unknown, which is blind, or a faith of the night. This is the first paradox; for faith is of truth, and truth is of faith; and truth, before it can become an object of faith, should be in its own light and be seen; otherwise what is false may be believed. The paradoxes flowing from such a faith are many; as that God the Father begat a Son from eternity, and that the Holy Spirit proceeds from both: and that each is a Person by Himself, and God; that the Lord both as to His soul and body, is from the mother; that those three Persons, consequently three Gods, created the universe; and that one of them descended, and assumed the Human, to reconcile the Father, and thus to save men; and that they who by grace obtain faith, and believe these paradoxes, are saved by the imputation, application, and translation of His justice to themselves; and that man, at his first reception of that faith, is like a statue, a stock, or a stone, and that faith inflows by the mere hearing of the Word; and that faith alone without the works of the law, and not formed from charity, is saving; and that it produces the remission of sins without any previous repentance; and that, merely by virtue of such remission of sins, the impenitent are justified, regenerated, and sanctified; and that afterwards charity, good works, and repentance, spontaneously follow. Besides many similar things, which, like offspring from an illegitimate bed, have all issued from the doctrine founded on the idea of three Gods. </p>

<p>54. BREVIS ANALYSIS.
<p>Instant Praesules Ecclesiae, ut Intellectus sub obedientia fidei captetur, imo quod Fides ignoti, quae est caeca seu nocturna, sit proprie fides, hoc primum paradoxum est, nam fides est veri, et verum est fidei, ac verum, ut fiat fidei, erit in sua luce et videbitur, alioquin potest credi falsum. Paradoxa ex tali fide profluentia, sunt plura; ut quod Deus Pater genuerit Filium ab aeterno, et quod spiritus Sanctus ab utroque procedat, et quod quisque sit Persona per se, et Deus; Quod Dominus tam quoad animam quam quoad corpus sit ex matre; Quod tres illae Personae, ita tres Dii, creaverint universum, et quod unus ex illis descenderit et assumserit Humanum, ad reconciliandum Patrem, et sic ad salvandum homines; et quod salventur per imputationem, applicationem et translationem justitiae Ipsius in illos qui ex gratia nanciscuntur fidem, et credunt illa paradoxa, et quod homo ad primam receptionem istius fidei sit instar statuae, trunci aut lapidis, et quod fides per solum auditum Verbi influat; et quod sola absque operibus legis et non formata ex charitate, salutifera sit; et quod operetur remissionem peccatorum absque praevia paenitentia; et quod ex sola illa remissione peccatorum impaenitens justificetur, regeneretur et sanctificetur; et quod deinde sua sponte sequantur charitas, bona opera, et resipiscentia; praeter similia plura, quae omnia ex doctrina super idea trium Deorum fundata, sicut proles ex toro non legitimo, procreatae, profluxerunt. </p>
