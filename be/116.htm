<h3 align="center" class="ired">《新教会教义纲要》 第116节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>BE116.附录：新天与新教会的信仰，其普遍形式如下：万世之前的主——耶和华——曾来到世间，为征服地狱，并荣耀他的人（HisHuman）；若非如此，无人能被拯救；信仰他的人得拯救。
【2】使用“普遍形式”这一措辞，因为这是信仰的普遍原则；信仰的普遍原则必存于信仰的整体和细节之中。无论是本质上还是位格上，上帝都是一位，圣三一在这位上帝里面，这位上帝就是主上帝拯救者耶稣基督；这是信仰的普遍原则。除非主已来过世间，否则无人能被拯救；这是信仰的普遍原则。主来到世间，为要将地狱从人类移除；他借着与地狱作战并赢得各战的胜利来达成此事；以这样的方式，他征服地狱并使其归入秩序，令其服从他自己；这是信仰的普遍原则。主来到世间，荣耀他在世间所呈现之人，就是将这人与万有之源的神性相结合，从而永远地保持地狱归入秩序并服从他自己；要成就这样的结合，唯有凭借他的人所经历的诸般试探，直至最终极的试探——十字架受难，他甚至忍受了这个试探；这是信仰的普遍原则。以上是关于主这方面的信仰的普遍原则。
【3】信仰的普遍原则在关于人这方面：人应当信仰主；因为通过对他的信仰，人得以与主连接，从而得救。信主意味着满怀信心他是救主；因为唯有那些生活良善者方有如此信心，因而信他也意味着生活良善。</p>

<h4 align="center">A Brief Exposition of New Church Doctrine (Stanley translation 1953) 116</h4>
<p>116. APPENDIX (serving as a fitting conclusion) The Faith of the New Heaven and the New Church in its universal form is this: The Lord from eternity, Who is JEHOVAH, came into the world that He might subjugate the hells and glorify His Human; without this Coming no mortal could have been saved, and those are saved who believe on Him.</p>
<p>[2] It is said, "in its universal form," because this is the universal form of faith; and the universal form of faith will be in each and every particular part thereof. It is a universal point of faith that God is one in essence and Person, in Whom is the Trinity, and that the Lord God, the Saviour Jesus Christ, is this God. It is a universal point of faith that no mortal could have been saved unless the Lord had come into the world. It is a universal point of faith that He came into the world to remove hell from man, and that He removed it by combats against it, and victories over it; whereby He subjugated it and reduced it to order under obedience to Himself. It is a universal point of faith that He came into the world to glorify the Human which He assumed in the world; that is, to unite it with the Divine of which it was begotten; and that, having thus subjugated hell by His own power, He keeps it eternally in order and under obedience to Himself. Inasmuch as both these tasks could be effected only by means of temptations admitted into His Human, even to the last, which was the passion of the cross, therefore He endured this also. These are the universal points of faith concerning the Lord.</p>
<p>[3] The universal point of the Christian faith on man's part is that he should believe on the Lord, for by believing on Him he has conjunction with Him, and thus salvation. To believe on Him is to have confidence that He saves; and because no one can have this confidence unless he lives well, therefore living a good life is also meant by believing on Him. </p>

<p>116. APPENDIX. 
<p>THE FAITH OF THE NEW HEAVEN AND THE NEW CHURCH IN ITS UNIVERSAL FORM, is this: That the Lord from eternity who is Jehovah, came into the world that He might subdue the hells, and glorify His Human; and that without this no mortal could have been saved; and that they are saved who believe in Him. 
<p>It is said in the universal form, because this is the universal of faith, and the universal of faith is what must enter into each and all things. It is a universal of faith, that God is one in essence and Person, in whom is the Trinity, and that the Lord God the Savior Jesus Christ is He. It is a universal of faith, that no mortal could have been saved, unless the Lord had come into the world. It is a universal of faith, that He came into the world to remove hell from man, and He removed it by combats against it, and by victories over it; thus He subdued it, and reduced it to order, and under obedience to Himself. It is a universal of faith, that He came into the world to glorify the Human which He assumed in the world, that is, to unite it with the Divine from which it was; thus, having subdued hell, He keeps it in order and under obedience to Himself to eternity. Inasmuch as both these could only be effected by means of temptations admitted into His Human, even to the last, which was the passion of the cross, therefore He endured that. These are the universals of faith concerning the Lord. The universal of Christian faith on man's part is, that he should believe in the Lord, for by believing in Him conjunction with Him is effected, and by conjunction salvation. To believe in Him, is to have confidence that He will save; and because none can have such confidence but he who lives well, therefore this is also meant by believing in Him. </p>

<p>116. APPENDIX CORONARIA.
<p>FIDES NOVI CAELI ET NOVAE ECCLESIAE IN UNIVERSALI FORMA, haec est; Quod Dominus ab aeterno, Qui est Jehovah, in Mundum venerit, ut subjugaret Inferna, et glorificaret Humanum suum; et quod absque eo nemo mortalium salvari potuerit, et quod salventur qui credunt in Ipsum.
<p>Dicitur in universali forma, quia hoc est universale fidei, ac universale fidei est quod in omnibus et singulis erit. Universale fidei est, quod Deus sit unus Essentia et Persona, in Quo Trinitas, et quod Dominus Deus Salvator Jesus Christus sit Ille. Universale fidei est, quod nullus mortalium salvari potuerit, nisi Dominus in Mundum venerit. Universale fidei est, quod in Mundum venerit, ut removeret Infernum ab homine, et removit illud per Pugnas contra illud, et per Victorias super illud; ita subjugavit illud, et redegit illud in ordinem, et sub suam obedientiam. Universale fidei est, quod in Mundum venerit, ut Humanum, quod in Mundo suscepit, glorificaret, hoc est, uniret Divino a Quo; sic Infernum ab Ipso subjugatum in ordine et sub obedientia sua in aeternum tenet. Quoniam utrumque hoc non potuit fieri quam per Tentationes in Humanum suum admissas usque ad ultimam illarum, ac ultima illarum fuit Passio crucis, ideo illam subivit. Haec sunt Universalia fidei de Domino.
<p>Universale Fidei Christianae a parte hominis est, ut credat in Dominum, nam per credere in Ipsum fit conjunctio cum Ipso, per quam Salvatio; credere in Ipsum, est fiduciam habere, quod Ipse salvet: et quia fiduciam habere non potest, nisi qui bene vivit, ideo etiam hoc per credere in Ipsum intelligitur. </p>
