<h3 align="center" class="ired">《新教会教义纲要》 第18节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>BE18.简要分析：宗教改革后，从罗马天主教分离出来的教会包括那些称自己为福音派、改革宗的教会，或自称抗罗宗或更正教的众教会，若照宗派领袖来命名，有路德宗和加尔文宗，在英格兰的教会走中间路线。（在此，我们不讨论希腊教会，他们很久以前已从罗马天主教分离出来。）抗罗宗或更正教众教会在各事上彼此有别，特别是关于圣餐、洗礼、拣选、基督位格方面的分歧，这是众所周知之事。然而在神性上的三位一体、原罪、基督之功的归算、唯信称义上却全体一致，这些事却并非众所周知。原因在于没什么人研究诸教会之间在教义上差异，从中找出它们的一致性。只有神职人员研究他们所在教会的教义，而平信徒极少深入钻研它们并由此研究它们的差异。然而，人们只要翻阅他们的著作，或留意他们的讲道，更正教众教会在上述四项的一致性——无论是总体原则，还是绝大多数的具体细节——自会显明。不过，这只是基于后续内容预先提出并提前注意的信息。</p>

<h4 align="center">A Brief Exposition of New Church Doctrine (Stanley translation 1953) 18</h4>
<p>18. BRIEF ANALYSIS
<p>The Churches which separated themselves at the Reformation from the Roman Catholic Church are composed of those who call themselves Evangelicals and Reformed, likewise Protestants or, from their leaders, Lutherans and Calvinists. Among these the Church of England holds a middle place. We shall say nothing here concerning the Greek Church which was separated long ago from the Roman Catholic Church.
<p>That the Protestant Churches dissent in various points, particularly concerning the Holy Supper, Baptism, Election, and the Person of Christ, is well known to many people, but it is not generally known that they all agree on the Articles concerning a Trinity of Persons in the Godhead, Original Sin, the Imputation of Christ's Merit, and Justification by Faith Alone. This is because few people apply themselves to exploring the differences of the tenets maintained by the different Churches consequently, neither do they inquire into those points on which they agree. Only the clergy study the tenets of their Church; the laity rarely understand them interiorly, and so are unacquainted with their differences. Nevertheless, they agree on the four Articles above-mentioned, both as regards the general affirmation and as regards most of the particulars therein. This appears evident from their books, if they are consulted, and from their sermons, if they are heard. This, however, is premised for information on account of what follows. </p>

<p>18. BRIEF ANALYSIS. 
<p>The churches which by the Reformation separated themselves from the Roman Catholic Church, are from those who call themselves Evangelical and Reformed, likewise Protestants, or from the names of their leaders, Lutherans and Calvinists, among which the church of England holds the middle place. We shall say nothing here of the Greek church, which long ago separated from the Roman Catholic church. That the Protestant churches differ in various things, particularly concerning the Holy Supper, Baptism, election, and the Person of Christ, is known to many; but that they all agree in the articles of a Trinity of Persons in the Divinity, original sin, imputation of the merit of Christ, and justification by faith alone, is not universally known. The reason of this is, because few study into the differences of dogmas among the churches, and consequently the agreements. It is only the clergy that study the dogmas of their church, while the laity rarely enter deeply into them, and consequently into their differences. That nevertheless they agree in the four articles above mentioned, both in their general principles, and in most of the particulars, will appear evident to anyone if he will consult their books, or attend to their sermons. This, however, is premised and brought to the attention, on account of what follows. </p>

<p>18. BREVIS ANALYSIS.
<p>Ecclesiae per Reformationem ab Ecclesia Romano-Catholica separatae, sunt ex illis, qui se vocant Evangelicos et reformatos, simul Protestantes, vel ab Antesignanis Lutheranos et Calvinianos, inter quas Ecclesia Anglicana medium tenet: de Ecclesia Graeca, quae ab antiquo a Romano-Catholica separata fuit, hic non sermo est. Quod Ecclesiae Protestantium dissideant in variis, imprimis de Sacra Caena, Baptismo, Electione, et de Persona Christi, multis notum est; at quod omnes in Articulis de Trinitate personarum in Divinitate, de Peccato Originali, de Imputatione meriti Christi, et de Justificatione per solam fidem, conveniant, non universaliter notum est; causa est, quia pauci student indagandis discriminationibus dogmatum inter Ecclesias, et inde nec convenientiis: Clerici solum <sup>1</sup>dogmatica suae Ecclesiae hauriunt, ac Laici raro illa quoad interiora, et inde nec quoad dissidentias. Quod tamen in quatuor illis Articulis in communibus et in plerisque particularibus conveniant, patescit ex Libris illorum si consuluntur, et ex Sermonibus si audiuntur. Sed hoc praemittitur ad notitiam propter sequentia.
