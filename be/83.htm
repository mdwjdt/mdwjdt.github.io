<h3 align="center" class="ired">《新教会教义纲要》 第83节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>BE83.简要分析：但以理书中如此说：我见了异象的时候、见有双角的公绵羊、两角都高、这角高过那角、更高的是后长的、我见那公绵羊往西、往北、往南抵触、自高自大、我正思想的时候、见有一只公山羊从西而来、遍行全地、这山羊两眼当中有一非常的角、它往公绵羊那里去、向它发烈怒、折断它的两角、将绵羊触倒在地、用脚践踏、这山羊的大角折断了、又长出四个非常的角来、四角之中有一角长出一个小角、向南、向东、向荣美之地、高及天象、将些天象和星宿抛落在地、用脚践踏、并且它自高自大、以为高及天象之君、除掉常献给君的燔祭、毁坏君的圣所、将真理抛在地上、我听见有一位圣者说话、又有一位圣者说、这除掉常献的燔祭和施行毁坏的罪过、将圣所与军旅践踏的异象、要到几时才应验呢、他对我说、到二千三百日（原文是：晚上和早晨）、圣所就必洁净（但以理书8:2-14）。很明显，这是预言教会未来状态的异象，因为它说“除掉常献给君的燔祭、毁坏君的圣所、公羊将真理抛在地上”；此外还说“一位圣者说、这除掉常献的燔祭和施行毁坏的罪过、将圣所与军旅践踏的异象、要到几时才应验呢”，并且“到晚上和早晨、圣所就必洁净”。“晚上和早晨”象征旧教会的结束，一个新教会的开始。</p>

<h4 align="center">A Brief Exposition of New Church Doctrine (Stanley translation 1953) 83</h4>
<p>83. BRIEF ANALYSIS
<p>It is written in Daniel:
<p>I saw in a vision... a ram which had two horns that were high . . . but the higher came up last and the horn pushed westward and northward and southward . . . and made itself great. . . . Then I saw a he-goat coming from the west over the face of the whole earth... with a horn between his eyes. And he ran to the ram in the fury of his strength... and broke his two horns... and cast him down to the earth and stamped upon him.... But the great horn of the he-goat was broken, and instead of it there came up four horns. . . . And out of one of them came forth a little horn which waxed exceeding great towards the south, towards the east, and towards glory . . . and even to the host of the heavens; and it cast down those of the host and of the stars to the earth, and stamped upon them. Yea, he raised himself as high as the Prince of the host, and took from him the daily sacrifice, and cast away the dwelling place of his sanctuary . . . and he cast down truth to the earth. Then I heard one of the saints saying . . . How long shall this vision be, the daily sacrifice and the desolating transgression, to give the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot? And he said, Even to the evening and the morning; then shall the sanctuary be justified. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_8_2.htm">Daniel 8:2-14</a>.
<p>It is clearly evident that this vision predicts the future states of the Church, for it is said that the daily sacrifice was taken away from the Prince of the host, the dwelling place of his sanctuary was cast down, and that the he-goat cast down truth to the earth further, that a saint said, How long shall this vision be, that it should be given to the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot? And that this should be even to the evening and the morning, when the sanctuary shall be justified. For, by the evening and the morning is meant the end of the Old Church, when a New Church commences. </p>

<p>83. BRIEF ANALYSIS. 
<p>It is written in Daniel: 
<p>I saw in a vision a ram, which had two horns that were high, but the higher came up last; and the horn pushed westward, and northward, and southward, and made itself great. Then I saw a he-goat coming from the west, over the face of the whole earth, which had a horn between its eyes; and he ran to the ram in the fury of his strength, and broke his two horns, and cast him down to the earth, and trampled him: but the great horn of the he-goat was broken, and instead of it there came up four horns; and out of one of them came forth a little horn which waxed exceeding great towards the south, towards the east, and towards honorableness, and even to the host of heaven; and it cast down of the host and of the stars to the earth, and trampled them: yea, he extolled himself to the prince of the host, and took from him the daily sacrifice, and cast away the place of his sanctuary, for he cast down truth to the earth. And I heard one saint saying, how long shall this vision be, the daily sacrifice, and the wasting transgression, that both the holy place and the host should be given to be trodden under foot? And he said, even to the evening the morning, then shall the holy place be justified (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_8_2.htm">Daniel 8:2-14</a>). 
<p>That this vision is a prediction of the future states of the church is very evident, for it declares, that "the daily sacrifice was taken away from the prince of the host, the habitation of his sanctuary cast down, and the he-goat cast down truth to the earth"; moreover, that "a saint said, How long shall this vision be, that both the holy place and the host should be given to be trodden under foot?" and that this should be "even to the evening the morning, when the holy place shall be justified." By "the evening the morning" is meant the end of the old church, when a New Church commences. </p>

<p>83. BREVIS ANALYSIS.
<p>Apud Danielem leguntur haec "In visione vidi Arietem, cui duo cornua alta, sed altius ascendens posterius; et quod cornu feriret versus Occidentem, Septentrionem, et Meridiem, et Magnum se faceret. Dein vidi Hircum venientem ab Occidente super facies totius terrae, cui erat cornu inter Oculos; et quod cucurrerit ad Arietem cum furore roboris sui, et fregerit duo cornua ejus, et projecerit eum in terram, et conculcaverit eum: at quod fractum sit cornu magnum Hirci, et loco ejus ascenderint quatuor cornua; et quod ex uno eorum exiret cornu exiguum, quod crevit valde versus Meridiem, versus Ortum et versus Decus; et usque ad Exercitum Caelorum, et dejecit in terram de Exercitu, et de Stellis, et conculcavit ea: imo extulit se ad Principem excercitus, et ab Eo sublatum est Juge, et projectum Habitaculum sanctuarii Ejus, quia projecit Veritatem in terram. Et audivi unum Sanctum, dicentem, quousque Visio haec, Juge et Praevaricatio vastans, ut detur Sancti et Excercitus conculcatio; et dixit, usque ad vesperam mane, tunc justificabitur Sanctum," Cap. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_summaria-expositio_83/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_daniel_8_2-14" target=_top>8:2-14</a>. Quod Visio illa praedicat status Ecclesiae futuros, patet manifeste; nam dicitur quod a Principe exercitus sublatum sit Juge, projectum Habitaculum sanctuarii Ejus, et quod Hircus projecerit Veritatem in terram: tum quod Sanctus dixerit, quo usque Visio haec, ut detur Sancti et Excercitus conculcatio; et quod hoc esset ad vesperam mane, quando justificabitur Sanctum; per Vesperam mane enim intelligitur finis Ecclesiae Veteris(?) quando Nova. </p>
