<h3 align="center" class="ired">《新教会教义纲要》 第63节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>BE63.将人的属性归于上帝的原因在于一切属灵的悟性和启发唯独来自主。因为主是道或神性之理，是照亮所有人的真光（约翰福音1:9）；他还说他作为光来到这世上，凡信他的不住在黑暗里（约翰福音12:46）。这种光随着由此产生的悟性流入那些承认主为天地之上帝并单单仰望他的人；它不会流入那些接受三位上帝之观念的人，就像从基督徒教会开始被建立以来的情形。如此观念纯粹属世，除了属世之光外，不会被其它光接受；如此观念无法被打开以允许和接受属灵之光。这就是为什么人们在上帝身上看不到属世以外性质的原因。此外，如果他们看到这些属于人的性质与神圣本质有多么不协调，并且倘若将它们从有关称义的条款中删除，那么在为新教会指定的时日之前——届时将会发生真理的充满和复原——他们就已经完全背离那个从一开始就建立在三位上帝敬拜这一基础上的宗教了。</p>

<h4 align="center">A Brief Exposition of New Church Doctrine (Stanley translation 1953) 63</h4>
<p>63. The reason human properties have been ascribed to God is that all spiritual perception and illumination is from the Lord alone. For the Lord is the Word or Divine Truth,
<p>the true Light which lighteth every man. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_9.htm">9</a>.
<p>He also says:
<p>I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on Me should not abide in darkness. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_12_46.htm">John 12:46</a>.
<p>This light, with the perception thence derived, flows only into those who acknowledge the Lord as the God of heaven and earth, and approach Him alone; it does not flow into those who entertain an idea of three Gods, as has been the case from the time the Christian Church began to be established. Being merely natural, this idea is receptive of no other light than natural light; it cannot be opened to admit and receive spiritual light. This is the reason men have seen no other properties in God than such as are natural. Moreover, had they seen how incongruous these human properties are with the Divine Essence, and if they had removed them from the article concerning justification, they would then have departed entirely from their religion, which from the beginning was founded on the worship of three Gods, before the time appointed for the New Church, when there would be a fulness and restoration of truth. </p>
<h4 align="center">A Brief Exposition of New Church Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 63</h4>
<p>63. The reason why they have ascribed human properties to God, is, because all spiritual perception and illustration is from the Lord alone; for the Lord is the Word or the Divine truth, and: 
<p>He is the true light which enlighteneth every man (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_9.htm">John 1:9</a>). 
<p>He also says: 
<p>I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth in Me, may not abide in darkness (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_12_46.htm">John 12:46</a>). 
<p>And this light, and the perception thence derived, inflows with those who acknowledge Him as the God of heaven and earth and approach Him alone, and not with those who cherish an idea of three Gods, which has been the case from the time the Christian church began to be established. This idea of three Gods, being a merely natural idea, receives no other light than natural, and cannot be opened to the afflux and reception of spiritual light; hence it is, that they have seen no other properties in God, than natural. Furthermore, had they seen how incongruous these human properties are to the Divine essence, and had they removed them from the article of justification, they must then have entirely departed from the religion, which from the beginning was founded on the worship of three Gods, before the time appointed for the New Church, when the fullness and restoration will take place. </p> </p>
<h4 align="center">Summaria Expositio 63 (original Latin 1769)</h4>
<p>63. Causa quod Proprietates humanas addixerint Deo, est quia omnis Spiritualis perceptio et illustratio est a Solo Domino; est enim Dominus Verbum, seu Divinum Verum, et est Lux vera quae illuminat omnem hominem, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_summaria-expositio_63/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_1_1" target=_top>Johannes 1:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_summaria-expositio_63/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_1_9" target=_top>9</a>: et dicit, Ego Lux in Mundum veni, ut omnis qui credit in Me, in tenebris non maneat, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_summaria-expositio_63/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_12_46" target=_top>Johannes 12:46</a>. et haec Lux et inde Perceptio solum influit apud illos qui Ipsum pro Deo Coeli et Terrae agnoscunt, et Ipsum Solum adeunt, et non apud illos qui ideam trium Deorum fovent, quod factum ab initio instaurationis Ecclesiae Christianae: haec idea, quia est mere naturalis, non recipit aliam lucem quam naturalem, nec potest aperiri ad affluxum et receptionem lucis spiritualis; inde est, quod non viderint alias proprietates in Deo quam naturales. Praeterea si vidissent has Divinae Essentiae incongruas, et a Justificationis Articulo removissent, plane excidissent Religione super Cultu trium Deorum ab initio fundata, ita ante tempus praestitutum pro Nova Ecclesia, quando Plenitudo et Restauratio. </p>
