<h3 align="center" class="ired">《新教会教义纲要》 第84节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>BE84.在马太福音中这么说：人子对左边的山羊说、离开我、因为我饿了、你们不给我吃、渴了、你们不给我喝、我作客旅、你们不留我住、我赤身露体、你们不给我穿、我病了、我在监里、你们不来看顾我、这些人要往永刑里去（马太福音25:41-43，46）。明显看出，这里的山羊与绵羊与但以理书中的公山羊和公绵羊代表同样的人群。山羊代表当今固执于唯信称义者，可从以下事实看出：被列举出来与绵羊相关的那些義行，他们都做了；当同样的行为论到山羊时，就说他们没做到，因此他们受罚。当今固执于唯信称义者忽视行为，因为他们否认行为之中的有拯救或教会的任何东西。当義被这样除去，由義而来的好行为不再被人记起，再没有做出任何努力从十诫之法回想起它们。在宗教中有个普遍规则：任何人只要不意欲良善，并因此不行善，他就会意欲邪恶，并因此作恶；反之亦然，人只要不意欲邪恶，并因此不作恶，他就会意欲良善，并因此行善。后者是“绵羊”，前者是“山羊”。偌若所有恶人在那里被象征为“山羊”，取代他们未做的那些義行，他们所作诸恶恐怕就被明确列举出来了。</p>

<h4 align="center">A Brief Exposition of New Church Doctrine (Stanley translation 1953) 84</h4>
<p>84. In Matthew we read these words:
<p>Then shall the Son of Man say to the he-goats on the left hand, Depart from me. . . for I was hungry, and ye gave Me no meat; I was thirsty, and ye gave Me no drink; I was a stranger, and ye took Me not in; naked, and ye clothed Me not; sick and in prison, and ye visited Me not. . . . And these shall go away into ever lasting punishment. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_25_41.htm">Matthew 25:41-43</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_25_46.htm">46</a>.
<p>It is evident that the same persons are here meant by the he-goats and sheep as the he-goats and ram in Daniel. By he-goats are meant those who are in the present day belief in justification by faith alone, as appears from this, that works of charity are specified in connection with the sheep, and it is said that they did them; and that the same works of charity are mentioned to the he-goats, but it is said that they did them not, and that therefore they are condemned. For those who are in the present day belief in justification by faith alone neglect works, because they deny that there is anything of salvation, or of the Church in them. When charity is thus removed, good works which proceed from charity are forgotten, and even obliterated, so that they are no longer remembered, nor is any effort made to recall them to mind from the Law of the Decalogue.
<p>It is a general rule in religion that so far as anyone does not will good actions, and so does not do them, to that extent he wills evil actions, and so does them. On the other hand, so far as anyone does not will evil actions, and so does not commit them, to that extent he wills good actions, and so does them. The latter are the sheep, the former the he-goats. If every evil person had been meant there by the he-goats, the evils which they had done would have been specified instead of the works of charity which they had not done. </p>

<p>84. We read these words in Matthew: 
<p>Then shall the Son of man say to the he-goats on His left hand, depart from Me, for I was hungry, and ye gave Me no meat; I was thirsty, and ye gave Me no drink; I was a stranger, and ye took Me not in; I was naked, and ye clothed Me not, I was sick and in prison, and ye visited Me not; and these shall go away into eternal punishment. That the same are here meant by "he-goats" and "sheep" as by the "he-goat" and "ram" in Daniel, is very evident. That by "he-goats" are meant those who are in the present justifying faith, appears from this, that to the sheep are enumerated works of charity, and it is said that they did them; and that to the he-goats the same works of charity are enumerated, but it is said that they did them not, and that they are therefore condemned. For they who are in the present justifying faith, neglect works, because they deny them to have anything of salvation or of the church in them. When charity is thus removed, good works, which are of charity, slip away from the mind, and are obliterated; so that they are never remembered, nor is the least effort made to recall them to mind from the Law of the Decalogue. It is a general rule of religion, that as far as anyone does not will goods, and hence does not do them, so far he wills evils, and hence does them; and on the contrary, that as far as anyone does not will evils, and hence does not do them, so far he wills goods, and hence does them. These latter are the "sheep," but the former are the "he-goats." If all the evil had been there meant by the "he-goats," instead of the works of charity which they had not done, the evils which they had done would have been enumerated. </p>
<h4 align="center">Summaria Expositio 84 (original Latin 1769)</h4>
<p>84. Apud Matthaeum leguntur haec "Tunc Filius hominis dicet Hircis, qui a sinistris, discedite a Me, nam Esurivi et non dedistis Mihi quod ederem; Sitivi et non potastis Me; Peregrinus eram, et non collegistis Me; Nudus eram et non induistis Me; Aegrotus eram, et in, custodia, et non visitastis Me; et hi abibunt in paenam aeternam." Quod non alii per Hircos et per Oves hic intelligantur, quam qui per Hircum et per Arietem apud Danielem, patet manifeste; quod per Hircos intelligantur qui in hodierna fide justificante sunt, constat ex eo, quod ad Oves enumerentur Opera charitatis, et dicatur quod illa fecerint; et quod ad Hircos enumerentur eadem Opera charitatis, et dicatur quod illa non fecerint, et quod hi ideo damnentur; est enim apud illos qui in hodierna fide justificante sunt, omissio operum, ex negatione, quod nihil Salutis et Ecclesiae in illis sit; cum Charitas ita removetur, bona Opera, quae sunt charitatis, elabuntur mente, et obliterantur adeo, ut nusquam in recordationem, aut in aliquem conatum revocationis illorum ex Lege decalogi, amplius veniant. Communis norma religionis est, quod quantum quis non vult bona et inde non facit illa, tantum velit mala et inde faciat illa; et quoque vicissim, quod quantum quis non vult mala, et inde non facit, tantum velit bona et inde faciat illa; et hi sunt Oves, illi autem Hirci. Si omnes mali per Hircos ibi intellecti fuissent, non Opera charitatis, quae non fecerunt, sed Mala quae fecerunt, enumerata fuissent. </p>
