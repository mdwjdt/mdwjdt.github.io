<h3 align="center" class="ired">《新教会教义纲要》 第85节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>BE85.在灵界的经历清楚地向我表明，除了上述意义以外，山羊并不代表别的什么。灵界会出现了物界各样事物，例如房屋、宫殿、乐园、花园以及其中各种树木，还有田野、耕地、以及平原和青翠的草场，当中有羊群和牛群。所有这些都与我们地球上的类似；除了后者起源于属世而前者起源于属灵之外，再没有任何其他区别。我经常在那儿见到绵羊和山羊，它们之间也有争斗，正如但以理书第八章所述。我还见过有角向前和向后弯曲的山羊，它们愤怒地冲向绵羊。我也见过的山羊一些有两个角，有些有四个角，他们用这些角猛烈地攻击绵羊。当我想知道这意味着什么时，就见一些人在一起争论关于義信相合与義信分离的话题。由此可以清楚地看出，就本质而言，当今与義脱离的“唯信称义”之信就是“山羊”，与義相合之信就是“绵羊”。</p>

<h4 align="center">A Brief Exposition of New Church Doctrine (Stanley translation 1953) 85</h4>
<p>85. That no others than those described above are meant by the he-goats was made clear to me by experience in the spiritual world. In that world appear all things that are in the natural world, such as houses and palaces, paradises and gardens, and in them trees of every kind likewise fields and cultivated lands, also plains and green pastures together with flocks and herds. All these resemble those upon our earth; nor is there any other difference than that the latter are from a natural, and the former from a spiritual, origin. I have often seen sheep and he-goats there, also combats between them, like the combat described in Daniel, chapter viii. I have seen he-goats with horns bent forwards and backwards, rushing with fury upon the sheep. I have seen some he-goats with two horns, and others with four, with which they vehemently struck at the sheep; and, when I looked to see what this meant, I saw some persons disputing together concerning faith united to charity, and concerning faith separated from charity. From this it plainly appeared that the present day belief in justification by faith alone, which considered in itself is faith disjoined from charity, is the he-goat, and that faith united with charity is the sheep. </p>

<p>85. That no other than the above described are meant by the "he-goats," has been manifested to me by experience in the spiritual world. In that world there appear all things that are in the natural world, such as houses and palaces, paradises and gardens, with trees of every kind; likewise fields and fallow lands, as also plains and green pastures, and also herds and flocks; all resembling those upon our earth; nor is there any other difference, than that in the natural world they are from a natural origin, but in the spiritual world from a spiritual origin. There I have often seen sheep and he-goats, also combats between them, like that described in Daniel (chapter 8). I have seen he-goats with horns bent forwards and backwards. and rushing with fury upon the sheep; I have seen some he-goats with two, and others with four horns, with which they vehemently struck at the sheep; and when I looked to discover what this meant, I saw some persons disputing together about faith conjoined with charity, and faith separated from charity; from whence it plainly appeared, that the present justifying faith, which considered in itself is a faith disjoined from charity, is "the he-goat," and that faith conjoined with charity is "the sheep." </p>
<h4 align="center">Summaria Expositio 85 (original Latin 1769)</h4>
<p>85. Quod non alii quam illi per Hircos intellecti sint, patuit mihi ab Experientia in Mundo Spirituali; in hoc Mundo parent omnia, quae in Mundo naturali, apparent domus et palatia; apparent paradisi et horti, et in illis arbores omnis generis, apparent agri et novalia, tum campi et vireta; quoque armenta et greges; omnia in tali similitudine in qua super nostra Tellure; nec alia intercedit differentia, quam quod haec sint ex Origine naturali, illa autem ex Origine spirituali. Ibi saepius vidi Oves et Hircos, et quoque pugnas inter illos(?) similes illi pugnae, quae describitur apud <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_summaria-expositio_85/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_daniel_8_1-27" target=_top>Danielem 8</a> Cap.; vidi Hircos cum cornibus antrorsum et retrorsum flexis, ac illos cum furore irruentes in Oves; vidi Hircos cum duobus et cum quatuor cornibus, quibus cum vehementia ferierunt Oves; et cum aspexi, quid esset, vidi aliquos rixantes inter se de Fide conjuncta Charitati, et de fide disjuncta a Charitate; ex qua patuit, quod hodierna fides justificans, quae in se spectata est Fides disjuncta a Charitate, sit Hircus, et quod Fides conjuncta Charitati sit Ovis. </p>
