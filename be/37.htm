<h3 align="center" class="ired">《新教会教义纲要》 第37节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>BE37.从诸多因素可以看出，三位一体的观念违背了开明的理性。哪个有理智的人可以忍受听到三位上帝创造了世界，或者可以忍受听到创造和维持、救赎与拯救、改造与更新是三位上帝的工作，而不是一位？另一方面，哪个有理智的人不愿意听到那个创造我们的上帝也救赎了我们，并更新和拯救了我们？由于后一种观念而不是前一种观念与理性相符，因此，在全世界范围内，没有一个拥有宗教信仰和健全理智的国家不承认上帝的独一性。众所周知，伊斯兰教徒以及亚洲和非洲的某些国家拒绝基督教，就是因为他们认为基督教崇拜三位上帝。基督徒对此指控的唯一答案是：尽管是三位，但拥有同一本质，因而是一位上帝。凭着赐予我的理性，我可以肯定：我能清楚地看明，除非来自独一的上帝，无论世界，还是天使之天，还是教会，甚至其中的任何事物，都不可能存在。</p>

<h4 align="center">A Brief Exposition of New Church Doctrine (Stanley translation 1953) 37</h4>
<p>37. That a trinity of Gods is contrary to enlightened reason may appear from these considerations. What man of sound reason can bear to hear that three Gods created the world, or can bear to hear that creation and preservation, redemption and salvation, reformation and regeneration are the work of three Gods, not of One? On the other hand, what man of sound reason is unwilling to hear that the same God Who created us also redeemed us and regenerates and saves us? As the latter idea and not the former accords with reason, there is, therefore, no nation upon the whole earth, possessed of religion and sound reason, which does not acknowledge one God. As is well known, the Mohammedans, also certain nations in Asia and Africa, abhor Christianity, because they believe there is in it the worship of three Gods; and the only answer of the Christians to the charge is that for the three there is one essence, thus one God. I can affirm, from the faculty of reason which has been given me, that I can clearly see that neither the world, nor the angelic heaven, nor the church, nor anything therein, could have come into existence or could subsist but from one God. </p>
<h4 align="center">A Brief Exposition of New Church Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 37</h4>
<p>37. That a trinity of Gods is contrary to enlightened reason, may appear from many considerations. What man of sound reason can bear to hear that three Gods created the world; or that creation and preservation, redemption and salvation, together with reformation and regeneration, are the work of three Gods, and not of one God? And on the other hand, what man of sound reason is not willing to hear that the same God who created us, redeemed us, and regenerates and saves us? As the latter sentiment, and not the former, enters into the reason, there is therefore no nation upon the face of the whole earth, possessed of religion and sound reason, but what acknowledges one God. That the Mohammedans, and certain nations in Asia and Africa, abhor Christianity, because they believe that it worships three Gods, is known; and the only answer of the Christians is, that the three have one essence, and thus are one God. I can affirm, that from the reason which has been given me, I can clearly see, that neither the world, nor the angelic heaven, nor the church, nor anything therein, could have existed, nor can subsist, but from one God. </p>
<h4 align="center">Summaria Expositio 37 (original Latin 1769)</h4>
<p>37. Quod Trinitas Deorum sit contra rationem illustratam, constare potest ex multis; quis homo sanae rationis audire potest, quod Tres Dii creaverint mundum; aut audire potest, quod Creatio et Conservatio, Redemptio et Salvatio, ac Reformatio et Regeneratio, sint trium Deorum, et non unius Dei. Et vicissim, quis homo sanae rationis non vult audire, quod Deus qui creavit nos, redemerit nos, ac regeneret et salvet nos. Quoniam haec et non illa intrant in rationem, ideo non datur Gens in universo terrarum orbe, cui est religio et sana ratio, quae non agnoscit unum Deum. Quod Mahumedani, et quaedam Gentes in Asia et Africa, abhorreant Christianismum, quia credunt in illo esse Cultum trium Deorum, notum est; et quod Christiani ad increpationem modo respondeant, quod Tribus sit una Essentia, et sic Unus Deus. Asseverare possum, quod ex Ratione mihi donata, videre possim, quod nec Mundus, nec Caelum Angelicum, nec Ecclesia, nec quicquam in illis, existere potuerit, et subsistere possit, nisi ex uno Deo. </p>
