<h3 align="center" class="ired">《新教会教义纲要》 第62节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>BE62.已看出这些不过是人的属性与上帝并不相称（尽管被归与上帝）的那些人，为了捍卫曾经被构想出的称义体系，并以正直的表象来掩饰它，就声称发怒、报复、诅咒之类的话是基于他的公义，因此在圣经中的多处提及，可以说适于上帝。但是，在圣经中上帝之“怒”用来象征性表示世人里面的恶，因为它与上帝相背，所以被称为上帝之“怒”。因此，并非上帝向人发怒，而是那人里面的恶向上帝发怒。又因为恶与罚相随，善与赏相伴，所以，当恶惩罚作恶之人时，在恶人看来貌似上帝惩罚他。这种情形就像罪犯将刑罚归咎于法律，或者玩火者将烧伤归咎于火，或像指责一个人为保护自己而拔出的剑，因为他冲向剑尖时被刺伤。这是上帝的公义。更多内容可在《揭开启示》一书中看到，该书论到上帝中以及来自上帝的公平公义（AR668）。关于将发怒归于上帝的解读（AR635）；以及关于上帝报仇的解读（AR658）。但这仅是字面上的意思，因为文字是根据现象和对应写成的；从属灵意义的角度来看并非如此，因为灵义是真理在自身光明之中。我可以肯定地说，天使无论何时听到有人说上帝因愤怒而决定咒诅人类，并视人类为敌，还通过他儿子——就像通过从他自己生下的另一位上帝——而与人类和解，对他们的影响不亚于有人因肠胃紊乱而呕吐；他们惊呼：“将上帝说成这样，太疯狂了！”</p>

<h4 align="center">A Brief Exposition of New Church Doctrine (Stanley translation 1953) 62</h4>
<p>62. Those who have perceived that merely human properties are unworthy of God, though these are attributed to Him, have said, in order to defend the system of justification, once it was conceived, and to cover it over with an appearance of rectitude, that anger, revenge, damnation and the like are predicated of His justice, and are therefore mentioned in several places in the Word, and so are thus appropriated to God. But in the Word, the anger of God signifies evil in man which is called the anger of God because it is contrary to God. Thus, it is not that God is angry with man, but that man, from the evil in him, is angry with God; and, as evil carries with it its own punishment, as good does its own reward, therefore, while evil punishes the evil-doer, it appears to him as though he were being punished by God. The case is like that of a criminal who attributes his punishment to the law, or like a person who blames the fire for burning him when he puts his hand into it, or like one who blames a drawn sword in the hand of a man who is defending himself for wounding him when he rushes upon its point. Such is the justice of God.
<p>But more of this may be seen in THE APOCALYPSE REVEALED, where it treats of justice and judgment in God and from God,<a href="../ar/668.htm">THE APOCALYPSE REVEALED 668</a>. That anger is ascribed to Him may be seen in<a href="../ar/635.htm">THE APOCALYPSE REVEALED 635</a>; likewise revenge,<a href="../ar/658.htm">THE APOCALYPSE REVEALED 658</a>. But this is only in the literal sense, because that sense is written according to appearances and correspondences; it is not so in the spiritual sense where truth is in its own light. I can affirm that whenever the angels hear anyone say that God determined in anger the damnation of the human race, and, as an enemy, was reconciled by His Son, as by another God begotten from Himself, they are affected in a manner similar to those who, from a disturbance in their bowels and stomach, are reduced to vomiting; and they exclaim: "What insanity to be able to say such things about God!" </p>

<p>62. They who have seen that merely human properties are unworthy of God, and yet are attributed to Him, in order to defend the system of justification once conceived, and to veil that appearance, have said that anger, revenge, damnation, and the like, are predicated of His justice, and are therefore mentioned in many parts of the Word, and as it were appropriated to God. But by the anger of God in the Word, is signified evil in man, which, because it is against God, is called the anger of God; not that God is angry with man, but that man from his evil is angry with God; and because there is in evil its own punishment, as in good its own reward, therefore while evil punishes the evil-doer, it appears as if God did it. For this is like a criminal, who attributes his punishment to the law, or like one who blames the fire for burning him when he puts his hand into it, or a drawn sword for wounding him when he rushes upon the point of it, while in the hand of one defending himself. Such is the justice of God. But of this more may be seen in The Apocalypse Revealed, where it treats of justice and judgment in God and from God (<a href="../ar/668.htm">Apocalypse Revealed 668</a>). That anger is ascribed to Him, may be seen (<a href="../ar/635.htm">635</a>); as likewise revenge (<a href="../ar/658.htm">658</a>); but this is in the sense of the letter, because that sense is written by appearances and correspondences, yet not in the spiritual sense, wherein truth is in its own light. This I can affirm, that whenever the angels hear anyone say, that God from anger determined on the damnation of the human race, and as an enemy was reconciled by His Son, as by another God begotten from Himself, they are affected in a manner similar to those, who from an uneasiness in their bowels and stomach are excited to vomiting; saying, What can be more insane than to affirm such things of God? </p>
<h4 align="center">Summaria Expositio 62 (original Latin 1769)</h4>
<p>62. Illi, qui viderunt Proprietates mere humanas indignas Deo, et tamen Ipsi attributas, ad tutandum Systema Justificationis semel conceptum, et ad velandum illud apparentia, dixerunt quod ira, vindicta, damnatio, et similia alia, sint praedicationes Justitiae Ipsius, et quod ideo in Verbo pluries dicantur et sicut approprientur Deo. Sed per iram Dei in Verbo significatur malum apud hominem, quod quia contra Deum est, dicitur ira Dei, non quod Deus irascatur homini, sed quod homo ex malo suo irascatur Deo; et quia malo inest sua paena, sicut bono sua retributio, ideo dum malum punit illum, apparet sicut Deus; hoc enim est sicut maleficus tribuit legi quod puniatur, aut igni quod uratur si manum immittit, aut ensi extenso in manu tutantis dum in mucronem incurrit: talis est Justitia Dei. Sed de his plura videantur in APOCALYPSI REVELATA, de Justitia et Judicio in Deo et a Deo, n: <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_summaria-expositio_62/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_668" target=_top>668</a>. Quod tribuatur Ipsi Ira, n: [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_summaria-expositio_62/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_340" target=_top>340</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_summaria-expositio_62/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_525" target=_top>525</a>.] <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_summaria-expositio_62/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_635" target=_top>635</a>. [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_summaria-expositio_62/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_658" target=_top>658</a>.] Quod etiam Vindicta, n: <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_summaria-expositio_62/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_658" target=_top>658</a> [. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_summaria-expositio_62/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_806" target=_top>806</a>]; sed haec in sensu literae, quia ille sensus per apparentias et correspondentias conscriptus est, non autem in sensu Spirituali, in hoc est veritas in sua luce. Hoc possum asseverare, quod Angeli, dum audiunt aliquem dicentem, quod deus ex ira concluserit damnationem Generis humani, ac ut inimicus per Filium, ut alterum Deum a se genitum, reconcilietur, fiant sicut qui ex commotione viscerum et simul stomachi exciuntur ad egestionem, dicentes, quid insanius de Deo potest dici. </p>
