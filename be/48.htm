<h3 align="center" class="ired">《新教会教义纲要》 第48节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>BE48.简要分析：在证明这一点之前，我们首先说明義、信以及被称为“果子”的好行为的起源和性质。信就是理，信的教导就是理的教导，理的教导停留在知性层面，也就是在思维中，由此在言语中。因此，它教导了我们当意欲什么以及当做什么；因而教导诸恶莫作，并且具体不作哪些恶；并教导众善奉行，具体要行哪些善。当人出于信而行善时，众善就将它们自己与众理相联合，因为“意”于是与“知”相合——善属于意，理属于知。通过如此联合，产生对善的喜爱之情，就其本质而言，它就是義；并产生对理的喜爱之情，就其本质来说，它就是信；二者相合，如同婚姻之合。由此婚姻产生好行为，如同从树上结出果子；因此，它们是善的果子，还是理的果子；后后在圣经用“葡萄”来象征，前者以“橄榄”来象征。</p>

<p>48. BRIEF ANALYSIS
<p>Before this proposition is demonstrated, we will first explain the derivation and nature of charity, of faith, and of good works which are called fruits. Faith is truth; wherefore the doctrine of faith is the doctrine of truth, and the doctrine of truth is in the understanding, thence in the thought, thence in the speech. Wherefore, it teaches what should be willed and what should be done; thus, that evils are to be shunned, and which evils in particular; and that good actions are to be done, and which in particular. When man does good from faith, goods unite themselves with truths, because the will is then united with the understanding; for good belongs to the will and truth to the understanding. From this conjunction arises the affection of good, which in its essence is charity, and the affection of truth, which in its essence is faith; and these two united make a marriage. From this marriage good works are produced as fruits from a tree; whence they become the fruits of good and the fruits of truth. The latter are signified in the Word by grapes, the former by olives. </p>

<p>48. BRIEF ANALYSIS. 
<p>Before this is demonstrated, we shall first explain the origin and nature of charity, and the origin and nature of faith, and thus the origin and nature of good works, which are called fruits. Faith is truth, wherefore the doctrine of faith is the doctrine of truth; and the doctrine of truth is of the understanding, and thence of the thought, and from this of the speech; wherefore it teaches what we are to will and do, thus that evils and what evils are to be shunned, and that goods and what goods are to be done. When man does goods then goods thence conjoin themselves with truths, because the will is conjoined with the understanding, for good is of the will, and truth is of the understanding; from this conjunction the affection of good exists, which in its essence is charity, and the affection of truth, which in its essence is faith, and these two united together constitute a marriage. From this marriage good works are produced, as fruits from a tree; and hence they are the fruits of good, and the fruits of truth; the latter are signified in the Word by grapes, but the former by olives. </p>

<p>48. BREVIS ANALYSIS.
<p>Antequam hoc demonstratur, primum coram intellectu detegetur, unde et quid charitas, ac unde et quid fides, et sic unde et quid bona opera, quae vocantur fructus: Fides est veritas, quare doctrina fidei est doctrina veritatis; ac doctrina veritatis est intellectus et inde cogitationis, et ex hoc loquelae; quare illa docet quid volendum et agendum est ita quod mala et quae mala fugienda sunt, ac quod bona et quae bona facienda sunt; cum homo bona inde facit, tunc bona se conjungunt cum veris, quia voluntas cum intellectu, bonum enim est voluntatis, ac verum est intellectus; ex hac conjunctione existit affectio boni, quae in sua essentia est charitas, et affectio veri, quae in sua essentia est fides, et hae duae unitae faciunt conjugium; ex hoc conjugio nascuntur bona opera, sicut ex arbore fructus; et sunt inde fructus boni et fructus veri; hi in Verbo significantur per uvas, illi autem per olivas. </p>
