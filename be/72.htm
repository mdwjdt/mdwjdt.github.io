<h3 align="center" class="ired">《新教会教义纲要》 第72节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>BE72.该教会处于末期，不再有任何信之理，因而再无義之善，这是显而易见的。信仰的诸谬消灭了教义诸理，生活的诸恶烧毁了義之诸善。哪里有信仰的诸谬，哪里就是生活的诸恶；哪里有生活的诸恶，同样，哪里就有信仰的诸谬（在适当章节将会详细论证）。至于为何迄今为止人们不知道“世界（原文是：世代）的末了”乃是象征教会的末期，是由于当诸谬被教导，由诸谬导致的教义被相信并奉为正统时，不可能知道该教会已走到尽头，因为谬被视为理，理被视为谬，于是谬驳斥理并将其抹黑，就像墨汁倒进清水，或煤烟涂抹白纸。人们皆相信，并且当今世代的博学者皆声明他们沐浴在福音至明亮的光照下；但事实上，就福音的一切意义而言，他们陷入幽暗之中；因此，一块白班覆盖着他们双眼的瞳孔。</p>

<h4 align="center">A Brief Exposition of New Church Doctrine (Stanley translation 1953) 72</h4>
<p>72. It is self-evident that the Church is at an end when there are no longer any truths of faith, and so no goods of charity. Falsities of faith extinguish truths of doctrine, and evils of life consume goods of charity; for wherever there are falsities of faith, there, likewise, are evils of life also wherever there are evils of life, there, likewise, are falsities of faith. These points will be demonstrated separately in their proper place.
<p>The reason it has hitherto been unknown that by the consummation of the age is meant the end of the Church is that, when falsities are taught, and when the doctrine from them is believed and honoured as orthodox, it cannot possibly be known that the Church is to be brought to a consummation. For falsities are regarded as truths, and truths as falsities; and then falsity rejects truth and blackens it, as ink blackens clear water, or as soot blackens white paper. For it is believed and proclaimed by the most learned men of this age that they are in the clearest light of the Gospel, although they are in thick darkness as to its entire meaning; thus, a white spot has covered the pupils of their eyes. </p>
<h4 align="center">A Brief Exposition of New Church Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 72</h4>
<p>72. That the church is then at an end, when there are no longer any truths of faith, and thence neither any goods of charity, is self-evident. That falsities of faith extinguish the truths of doctrine, and evils of life burn up the goods of charity, and that where there are falsities of faith, there likewise are evils of life, and that where there are evils of life, there likewise are falsities of faith, will be demonstrated in detail in its own chapter. 
<p>The reason why it has been hitherto unknown that by "the consummation of the age" is meant the end of the church, is because when falsities are taught, and when the doctrine resulting from them is believed and honored as orthodox, then it cannot possibly be known that the church is to be brought to a consummation, for falsities are regarded as truths, and truths as falsities, and then the falsity explodes the truth and blackens it, like ink poured into clear water, or soot thrown upon white paper. For it is believed, and the most learned of the present age proclaim it, that they are in the clearest light of the Gospel, although as to the whole face they are in thick darkness; thus the white speck has covered over the pupils of their eyes. </p>
<h4 align="center">Summaria Expositio 72 (original Latin 1769)</h4>
<p>72. Quod tunc finis Ecclesiae sit, quando non amplius vera fidei et inde nec bona charitatis sunt, patet ex se: quod falsa fidei exstinguant vera doctrinae, ac mala vitae exurant bona charitatis; et quod ubi falsa fidei sunt, ibi etiam sint mala vitae, et quod ubi mala vitae etiam sint falsa fidei, singulariter in sua Transactione demonstrabitur. Quod hactenus latuerit, quod per Consummationem saeculi intellectus sit finis Ecclesiae, est causa, quia ubi falsa docentur, ac doctrina ex illis creditur et honoratur ut orthodoxa, nullatenus potest sciri, quod Ecclesia consummanda sit; falsa enim spectantur ut vera, ac vera ut falsa, et tunc falsum explodit verum, et denigrat illud, sicut atramentum aquam limpidam, aut fuligo chartam albam: creditur enim, et a Doctissimis hujus saeculi conclamatur, quod in clarissima luce Evangelii sint, tametsi quoad totam faciem in caligine; ita albugo obtexit pupillas oculorum. </p>
