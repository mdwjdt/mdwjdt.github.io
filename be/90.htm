<h4 align="center"></h4><p>BE90.为了让我可以确定并相信那些固执于当今唯信称义之信仰者也是“龙”的象征意义，我被允许看到成千上万这样的人聚集在一起，他们隔远看起来就像一条龙，尾巴很长，看起来满身像荆棘似的尖刺，这些象征诸谬。另一次还显现一条更大的龙，后身抬起，尾巴甚至向天举起，为要从天上拖下众星；众星象征诸理。</p>

<h4 align="center">A Brief Exposition of New Church Doctrine (Stanley translation 1953) 90</h4>
<p>90. In order that I might also be assured and convinced that those who have confirmed themselves in the present-day belief in justification by faith alone are also meant by the dragon, I was allowed to see many thousands of them assembled together, and then they appeared at a distance like a dragon with a long tail, seemingly full of spikes like thorns, signifying falsities. Once also there appeared a still greater dragon which, with raised back, lifted his tail even towards heaven, in the effort to draw down the stars from thence. The stars there signify truths. </p>
<h4 align="center">A Brief Exposition of New Church Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 90</h4>
<p>90. That I might also be confirmed and convinced, that they who have confirmed themselves in the present justifying faith, are meant by the dragon, it was given me to see many thousands of them assembled together, and they then appeared at a distance like a dragon with a long tail, which seemed full of spikes like thorns, which signified falsities. Once also there appeared a still greater dragon, which, raising up his back, lifted his tail towards heaven, and endeavored to draw down the stars from thence; "stars" there signify truths. </p>
<h4 align="center">Summaria Expositio 90 (original Latin 1769)</h4>
<p>90. Ut quoque confirmarer et convincerer, quod illi qui in hodierna fide justificante se confirmaverunt, etiam per Draconem intelligantur, datum est videre plura millia ex illis in Coetum collecta, et tunc e longinquo apparuerunt sicut Draco cum longa Cauda, quae visa est obsita spiculis sicut sentis, quae significabant falsitates. Semel etiam visus est Draco adhuc major, qui elato dorso erexit Caudam usque versus Caelum cum conatu detrahendi stellas inde; stellae ibi significant veritates. </p>
