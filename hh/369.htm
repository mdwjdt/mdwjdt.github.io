<h3 align="center" class="ired">《天堂与地狱》 第369节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>369、每个人，无论男女，都享有理智和意志。但对男人来说，理智占主导地位，对女人来说，意志占主导地位，而性格是由那占主导地位的决定的。然而，天堂的婚姻中并没有什么主导地位的，因为妻子的意志也是丈夫的意志，丈夫的理智也是妻子的理智，因此每一方都爱像对方那样去意愿和思考，也就是彼此相互地意愿和思考，因而结合在一起。这种结合是实实在在地结合，因为妻子的意志进入了丈夫的理智，丈夫的理智进入了妻子的意志，尤其是当他们互相注视对方脸的时候。正如前面反复所述的，天堂里有思想和情感的共享，尤其是夫妻之间，因为他们彼此互爱。由此可以确定什么是天堂里心智的结合、造就成婚姻并产生婚姻之爱，也就是说，彼此都相互地希望自己所拥有的也属于对方。</p>
<p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>369. 每个人, 无论男女, 都具有理解力和意愿. 但对男人来说, 理解力占主导地位; 对女人来说, 意愿占主导地位; 而性格是由那占主导地位者决定的. 然而, 天堂的婚姻并不存在什么主导地位; 事实上, 妻子的意愿也是丈夫的意愿, 丈夫的理解力也是妻子的理解力, 因为双方都愿意像对方那样去意愿和思考, 也就是相互意愿和思考. 他们就这样合而为一. 这种结合是实实在在的结合, 因为妻子的意愿进入丈夫的理解力, 丈夫的理解力进入妻子的意愿, 当他们互相注视对方的脸时, 尤其如此; 因为如前面频繁所述, 天堂有一种思维和情感的共享, 尤其是丈夫和妻子, 因为他们彼此相爱. 这一切清楚表明在天堂, 那构成婚姻并产生婚姻之爱的心智结合是何性质, 即: 双方都希望自己的福分也属于对方, 并且这是相互的. </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>369. 男人和女人皆有認知和意志。啟男人而言, 認知占主啟地位, 啟女人而言, 傾向于意志;人的性格如何啟乎哪个占主啟地位。不啟, 天國的婚姻中並不存在啟主啟啟;實際上, 妻子的意志屬於丈夫, 丈夫的認知屬於妻子, 因為兩者均願意像對方那樣運用意志和認知, 他們因此得合而為一。<br><br>這種結合是實實在在的結合:妻子的意志著實進入丈夫的思維, 丈夫的思維著實進入妻子的意志, 特別是兩者相互凝視的時候。因為正如前面所說, 在天國, 人的思維和情感是相通的。夫妻之間尤其如此, 因為他們彼此相愛。<br><br>由此可知使天國產生婚姻和婚愛的心靈的結合是何性質——就是二者皆希望自己的福分也屬於對方。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #369 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>369. Both man and woman are endowed with intellect and volition, but for men intellect tends to take the lead, while for women it is volition that does so; and people are characterized by what is in control. There is no controlling, though, in marriages in the heavens. The volition of the wife actually belongs to the husband and the intellect of the husband belongs to the wife. This is because each wants to intend and think like the other, mutually, that is, and reciprocally. This is how the two are united into one. <br><br>This is a truly effective union. The intent of the wife actually enters into the thinking of the husband, and the thinking of the husband enters into the intent of the wife, especially when they look each other in the face, since as already noted there is a sharing of thoughts and affections in the heavens. There is all the more sharing between a wife and a husband because they love each other. <br><br>We may gather from this what the union of minds is like that makes a marriage and that gives birth to marriage love in the heavens - it is that each wants his or her blessings to belong to the other, and that this is mutual. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #369 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p> 369. Everyone, whether man or woman, rejoices in understanding and will; but with the man the understanding predominates, and with the woman the will predominates, and the character is determined by that which predominates. Yet in marriages in the heavens there is no predominance; for the will of the wife is also the husband's will, and the understanding of the husband is also the wife's understanding, since each loves to will and to think as the other, that is, mutually and reciprocally. Thus are they conjoined into one. This conjunction is actual conjunction, for the will of the wife enters into the understanding of the husband, and the understanding of the husband into the will of the wife, and this especially when they look into one another's faces; for, as has been repeatedly said above, there is in the heavens a sharing of thoughts and affections, more especially with husband and wife, because they reciprocally love each other. From all this it can be established what the conjunction of minds is that makes marriage and produces conjugial love in the heavens, namely, that one wishes what is his own to be the other's, and this reciprocally. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #369 (Ager, 1900)</h4><p>369. Everyone, whether man or woman, possesses understanding and will; but with the man the understanding predominates, and with the woman the will predominates, and the character is determined by that which predominates. Yet in heavenly marriages there is no predominance; for the will of the wife is also the husband's will, and the understanding of the husband is also the wife's understanding, since each loves to will and to think like the other, that is mutually and reciprocally. Thus are they conjoined into one. This conjunction is actual conjunction, for the will of the wife enters into the understanding of the husband, and the understanding of the husband into the will of the wife, and this especially when they look into one another's faces; for, as has been repeatedly said above, there is in the heavens a sharing of thoughts and affections, more especially with husband and wife, because they reciprocally love each other. This makes clear what the conjunction of minds is that makes marriage and produces marriage love in the heavens, namely, that one wishes what is his own to be the others, and this reciprocally. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #369 (original Latin)</h4><p>369. Unusquisque tam vir quam mulier gaudet intellectu et voluntate, sed usque apud virum praedominatur intellectus, et apud mulierem praedominatur voluntas, et homo est secundum id quod praedominatur in conjugiis autem in caelis, non est aliquod praedominium est enim voluntas uxoris etiam mariti, et intellectus mariti etiam uxoris, quoniam unus amat velle et cogitare sicut alter, ita mutuo et vicissim inde conjunctio eorum in unum. Conjunctio illa est actualis conjunctio, intrat enim voluntas uxoris in intellectum mariti, et intellectus mariti in voluntatem uxoris, et hoc imprimis cum se spectant facie ad faciem; nam ut supra saepius dictum est, est communicatio cogitationum et affectionum in caelis, magis conjugis cum conjuge quia se mutuo amant. Ex his constare potest, qualis est conjunctio mentium, quae facit conjugium, et producit amorem conjugialem in caelis, quod nempe sit, quod unus velit ut sua sint alterius, et sic reciproce. </p>
