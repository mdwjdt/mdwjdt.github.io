<h4 align="center"></h4><p>496、然而，善灵会检查他们，以发现他们的品性，这事通过各种方式进行，因为在第一个状态下，恶人也能和善人一样讲真理、行善事，原因如前所述，即他们表面上也过着道德的生活，因为他们生活在政府管理之下，服从法律，由此获得公正和诚实的名声，赢得好感，升官发财。但恶灵与善灵的区别主要在于：当谈到外在事物时，恶灵都殷切关注；但当谈到内在事物、也就是教会和天堂的真理和良善时，却很少关注。他们在听这些事，却不用心也不喜乐；也可以通过这样的事实来区分他们：他们总是转向特定的方向，当剩下他们独处的时候，他们便沿着朝向那些方向的路行走。从他们所面对的区域和所走的道路就能知道是什么样的爱在引导着他们。</p>

<p>496. 最后, 善灵会检查他们, 以查明他们的性质. 这事以各种方式进行, 因为在第一个状态下, 恶人和善人一样讲真理, 行善事. 原因如前所述, 即: 和善人一样, 他们表面上也过着道德的生活, 因为他们生活在政府和法律之下, 由此获得公正, 诚实的名声, 赢得好感, 因而被提到高位, 取得财富. 但恶灵与善灵的区别主要在于: 当谈到外在事物时, 恶灵格外关注; 但当谈到内在事物, 也就是教会与天堂的真理与良善时, 却漠不关心. 他们的确听到这些事, 却不理会, 觉得索然无味. 这两类人也可通过他们始终朝向的特定区域被区分开, 当任由他们自己时, 他们便沿着朝向那些区域的道路走. 从他们所面对的区域和所走的道路就能知道是什么样的爱在引导他们. </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>496. 最後, 會有善靈前來審視他們, 以確認他們的秉性。這事通過各種途徑進行, 因為在第一個狀態下, 惡人能像善人一樣宣說真理, 與人為善。正如前面所解釋的, 他們也曾過著道德的生活, 因為他們生活在政府管治和法律約束之下, 加之道德的生活能讓他們贏得誠實公平的名聲, 取得人們的信任, 因而獲得地位和財富。但是, 惡靈與善靈還是很容易分辨出來。因為惡靈特別注意外在的事物, 對教會和天國之理與善漠不關心。在這些事上, 他們充耳不聞, 漫不經心, 覺得索然無味。另外, 一個人的秉性也能從他恒常面對的特定區域辨別出來。獨處時, 他就朝那地方走去。所以, 從一個人所面對的區域和所選擇的道路, 也可判斷他是受怎樣的欲望所主導。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #496 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>496. Eventually, good spirits examine them to determine their nature. This is done in various ways because in this first state evil people can say true things and do good things just the way good people do. As I have already explained, this is because they have lived just as morally in outward form because they were living under governments and laws, and because this gained them a reputation for fairness and honesty, won people over to them, and raised them to high office and wealth. However, one can tell evil spirits from good ones particularly by the fact that the evil ones pay close attention when the conversation is about external concerns and little attention when it is about more inward matters, about the true and good principles of the church and heaven. They do hear such things, but without any real attention or pleasure. One can also identify them by the fact that they consistently turn toward certain regions, and when they are left to themselves follow paths that lead to them. One can tell what love is leading them from the regions they face and the paths they follow. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #496 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p> 496. Such, however, are explored by good spirits to discover what they are, and this in various ways; since in this, the first state, the evil equally with the good utter truths and do good acts, and for the reason mentioned above, that, like the good, they have lived morally in outward respects, since they have lived under governments, and subject to laws, and have thereby acquired a reputation for justice and honesty, and have gained favour, and thus been raised to honours, and have acquired wealth. But evil spirits are distinguished from good spirits chiefly by this, that the evil give eager attention to whatever is said about external things, and but little attention to what is said about internal things, which are the truths and goods of the Church and of heaven. These they listen to, but not with attention and joy. They are also distinguished by their turning repeatedly in specific directions, and following, when left to themselves, the paths that lead in those directions. From such turning to certain quarters and going in certain ways it is known what is the kind of love that leads them. </p><p align="center">------------</p>

<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #496 (original Latin)</h4><p>496. Explorantur usque a bonis spiritibus quales sunt, et hoc variis modis; quoniam in primo hoc statu mali aeque vera loquuntur, ac bona agunt, sicut boni; ex causa, de qua supra, quia aeque moraliter vixerunt in externa forma, quoniam in regiminibus, et sub legibus, et quoniam per id aucupaverunt famam justi et sinceri, et captaverunt animos, et sic evecti sunt ad honores, et lucrati opes. Internoscuntur vero mali spiritus a bonis imprimis per id, quod mali cupide attendant ad illa quae dicuntur de externis, et parum quae de internis, quae sunt vera et bona ecclesiae et caeli; haec quidem audiunt, sed non cum attentione et gaudio: internoscuntur etiam per id, quod frequenter se convertant ad certas plagas, et cum sibi relicti sunt, quod eant vias quae illuc tendunt. Ex conversione ad plagas, et ex progressione per vias, noscitur qualis est amor qui ducit. </p>
