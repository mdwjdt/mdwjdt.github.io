<h3 align="center" class="ired">《天堂与地狱》 第79节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>79、我的很多经验都证明了这一点。下面我就谈这些事。<br><br>
在天堂里，从来就没有一位天使感知上帝是以人形以外的任何形像而存在的。值得注意的是，高层天堂的天使甚至不能以任何其它的形像来思考上帝。他们必须以这种方式来思考，是由于流入的神性本身以及天堂的形像——他们四处扩散的思维与这形像和谐一致。每位天使的思维都在天堂里扩散，照着其扩散的程度他拥有相应的聪明和智慧。正因如此，天堂里所有天使都承认主，因为唯有在祂里面存在神性人身。不仅天使告诉了我这一切，而且当我被提升到天堂的内部时，我已经能够感知到这一切。由此可见，越聪明的天使越清楚地感知到这个真理，也因此他们看见主。主是以一位神性天使的形像、也就是人的形像而被看见的，看见祂的人是那些承认并相信一位可见的上帝的人，而那些相信一位不可见之神的人则看不见。因为前者能看见他们的上帝，而后者则不能。</p>
<p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>79. 大量经历向我证明, 事实的确如此, 下面容我谈谈某些经历. 天堂里的所有天使从来不以其它方式理解神性, 无不认为神性是人的形式; 值得注意的是, 高层天堂的天使不能以任何其它方式思想神性. 他们以这种方式思考的必要性, 出自所流入的神性本身, 以及与其四处发散的思维相一致的天堂形式. 因为一位天使的一切思维都发散到天堂, 他照着这种发散而拥有聪明和智慧. 正因如此, 天堂里的所有天使都承认主, 因为祂里面只有神性人身. 不仅天使告知我这一切, 而且当被提入天堂的内在气场时, 我还能觉察到它. 由此明显可知, 天使越有智慧, 就越能清楚觉知这个真理; 正因如此, 主向他们显现. 因为主以一个神性天使的形式, 也就是人的形式向那些承认并相信一位可见神性的人, 而非那些相信一位不可见神性的人显现. 事实上, 前者能看见他们的神性, 而后者则不能. </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>79. 大量經歷已向我證明這個事實:天國的天人無不以人的形相來看待上帝。更啟得一提的是, 高層天的天人無法將上帝想像為其它形相。他們如此思維, 是因為所流入他們裡面的神性及決定其思維延伸之天國的形態。事實上, 天人的思維都是向外延伸的, 延伸的程度決定了他們擁有聰明和智慧的程度, 這是天人皆承認主的原因。只有主才是神性之人, 這不僅是天人告訴我的資訊, 也是我被提至天國內層時所獲得的領悟。<br><br>由此可見, 越有智慧的天人, 對此越有清楚的覺悟。他們由此而看見主。對於承認和相信一位可見之上帝的人, 主以神聖天人的形相(也就是人的形相)向他們顯現, 反之則不然。前者能看見主的聖容, 後者不能。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #79 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>79. The truth of this has been witnessed to me by an abundance of experiences, some of which now follow. <br><br>None of the angels in the heavens ever sees the Divine in any form except the human form. Even more remarkably, angels in the higher heavens cannot think about what is divine in any other way. They are led into the necessity of thinking this way because of the essential divine that is flowing into them and also because of the form of heaven, which determines how their thoughts reach out around them. In fact, all the thought that angels have spreads out in heaven, and they have intelligence and wisdom in proportion to this outreach. This is why everyone there acknowledges the Lord, since the divine human exists only in him. I have not only been told this by angels, I have been allowed to perceive it when I was raised into a more inward sphere of heaven. <br><br>We can see, then, that the wiser angels are, the more clearly they perceive this, which is why the Lord is visible to them. The Lord does appear in a divine angelic form, which is a human form, to people who acknowledge and trust in a visible Divine Being, but not to people who acknowledge and trust in an invisible Divine Being. The former can see the Lord's divine [form], but the latter cannot. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #79 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p>79. That this is true has been proved to me by much experience, about which something will now be said. All the angels who are in the heavens never perceive the Divine in any other than a human form, and what is wonderful, those in the higher heavens are unable to think of the Divine in any other way. The necessity of their thinking in this way comes from the Divine Itself which inflows, and also from the form of heaven in accordance with which their thoughts extend around. For, every thought that an angel has, is extended into heaven, and he has intelligence and wisdom in accordance with that extension. It is in consequence of this that all in heaven acknowledge the Lord, because there is no Divine Human except in Him. Not only have I been told all this by angels, but when elevated into the inner sphere of heaven, I have been enabled also to perceive it. From this it is evident that the wiser the angels are, the more clearly do they perceive this truth; and it is as a result of this that the Lord appears to them. For the Lord appears in a Divine angelic form which is Human to those who acknowledge and believe in a visible Divine, but not to those who believe in an invisible one. For the former can see their Divine, but the latter cannot see theirs. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #79 (Ager, 1900)</h4><p>79. That this is true has been proved to me by much experience, about which something shall now be said. No angel in the heavens ever perceives the Divine as being in any other than a human form; and what is remarkable, those in the higher heavens are unable to think of the Divine in any other way. The necessity of thinking in this way comes from the Divine itself that flows in, and also from the form of heaven in harmony with which their thoughts spread forth. For every thought of an angel spreads forth into heaven; and the angels have intelligence and wisdom in the measure of that extension. It is in consequence of this that all in heaven acknowledge the Lord, because only in Him does the Divine Human exist. Not only have I been told all this by angels, but when elevated into the inner sphere of heaven I have been able to perceive it. From this it is evident that the wiser the angels are the more clearly they perceive this truth; and it is from this that the Lord is seen by them; for the Lord is seen in a Divine angelic form, which is the human form, by those who acknowledge and believe in a visible Divine Being, but not by those who believe in an invisible Divine. For the former can see their Divine Being, but the latter cannot. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #79 (original Latin)</h4><p>79. Quod ita sit, ex pluri experientia mihi testatum factum est, de qua aliquid in nunc sequentibus. Omnes angeli qui in caelis sunt, nusquam Divinum sub alia forma quam Humana percipiunt et quod mirum, qui in caelis superioribus sunt, non possunt aliter de Divino cogitare; feruntur in illam cogitandi necessitatem ex ipso Divino quod influit, et quoque ex forma caeli, secundum quam cogitationes illorum se circum extendunt omnis enim cogitatio, quae est angelis, extensionem habet in caelum, et secundum illam extensionem est illis intelligentia et sapientia inde est, quod omnes ibi agnoscant Dominum, quia Divinum Humanum non datur quam in Ipso. Haec mihi non solum ab angelis dicta sunt, sed etiam datum est percipere, dum elevatus in sphaeram interiorem caeli. Inde patet, quod quo sapientiores angeli sunt, eo clarius percipiant hoc et inde est, quod Dominus illis appareat; Dominus enim apparet in forma Divina Angelica, quae est Humana, illis qui Divinum visibile agnoscunt et credunt, non autem qui Divinum invisibile; illi enim videre suum Divinum possunt, hi autem non possunt. </p>
