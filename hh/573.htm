<h3 align="center" class="ired">《天堂与地狱》 第573节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>573、因为地狱之火意味着从自我之爱涌出的一切作恶的欲望，这火也意味着地狱中存在的折磨。因为这爱所产生的欲望就是加害那些不尊重、不顺服和不膜拜自己的人。与由此激起的愤怒，以及由此愤怒而产生的仇恨和复仇相称的是向他们发泄愤怒的欲望。当这种欲望在社群的每个人里面活跃、而且没有外在约束时（不再惧怕法律，害怕丧失名声、荣誉、利益和性命），每个人都会出于自身邪恶的冲动去攻击别人，只要获胜，就征服其余的人，使他们服从自己的统治，折磨不顺服的人，以此为乐。这种快乐是暴政之乐的密不可分，以至于它们具有同样的强度，因为伤害他人的快乐就包含在一切敌意、嫉妒、仇恨和报复中（如前文所述），它们都是那种爱的邪恶。所有的地狱都是这样的社群，因此，每个人都对他人心怀仇恨，并且只要力所能及，就残忍地迸发出来。地狱之火也表示这些残酷和折磨，因为它们是欲望的结果。</p>
<p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>573. 由于地狱之火表示从自我之爱流出的一切作恶的欲望, 所以这火也表示诸如存在于地狱中的那种折磨和痛苦. 因为这爱所产生的欲望是加害不崇敬, 尊重和敬拜自己之人的欲望; 并且随着这种狂怒, 以及出于这狂怒的仇恨和报复占上风, 还会有一种向他们发泄怒火的欲望. 当这种欲望在一个社群的每个人里面活跃, 并且没有外在约束, 如对法律, 丧失名声, 荣耀, 利益和生命的畏惧时, 每个人都会出于纯粹的恶意攻击别人. 强者得胜, 并将其余的人置于自己的统治之下, 以折磨凡不顺服的人为乐. 这种快乐与掌权的快乐联结得如此紧密, 以致它们具有同样的强度. 这是因为害人的快乐就包含在一切敌意, 嫉妒, 仇恨和报复中, 它们都是那爱的邪恶, 如前所述. 所有地狱都是这类社群; 因此, 那里的每个人都对他人心怀仇恨, 并且只要有能力, 就从仇恨爆发为残忍. 地狱之火也表示这些残忍和折磨的行为, 因为它们是欲望的结果. </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>573. 地獄之火既指從我欲所流出的一切邪惡的欲望, 自然也意味著地獄的種種痛苦。因為人被我欲驅動, 必意欲傷害一切不恭敬, 順從, 崇拜他的人。當憤怒, 仇恨, 報復之心爆發時, 他們就兇殘地攻擊別人。當社群內的每個人都懷有這些欲望, 又無外在的約束(對遭受法律刑罰或喪失名聲, 地位, 利益, 生命的恐懼), 他們就以惡毒之心彼此攻擊傷害。強者將弱者置於自己的統治之下, 殘忍地折磨那些不願服從的人, 以此為樂。殘暴之樂與專制之樂是一體的, 表現出一樣的強度, 因為敵對, 妒忌, 仇恨, 報復之中含有殘暴。正如前面所說, 敵對, 妒忌, 仇恨, 報復都是殘暴之性的表現。<br><br>所有地獄的社群都是這樣, 每個人都懷著仇恨, 只要力所能及, 就顯出殘暴之性。<br><br>地獄之火就意味著這種殘暴, 折磨的行徑, 因為它們是欲望的必然反應。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #573 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>573. Since hellfire means all the craving to do evil that flows from love for oneself, that same fire also means the kind of torment that occurs in the hells. This is because the impulses that arise from that love are urges to wound people who do not offer respect and deference and reverence. To the extent that rage takes charge, and the hatred and vengefulness that come from rage, people are driven to attack others viciously. When this impulse is inherent in everyone in a community where there are no external restraints, no fears of the law or of loss of reputation or position or profit or life, everyone attacks everyone else out of sheer malice. The strong conquer and subject the rest to their tyranny, cheerfully torturing any who do not surrender. This latter delight is integral to the delight in tyranny to the point that they are of equal intensity. This is because sadism is inherent in hostility, envy, hatred, and vengefulness, which as already noted are the evils of a love of cruelty. <br><br>All the hells are communities like this, so everyone there cherishes hatred toward others in her or his heart and bursts out in savagery whenever there is the strength to do so. <br><br>These acts of savagery and torture are what are meant by hellfire, because they are the results of their obsessions. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #573 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p>573. Because infernal fire means every lust for doing evil that flows forth from the love of self; this fire means also such torment as exists in the hells. For the lust from that love is a lust for injuring others who do not honour, venerate and worship oneself; and in proportion to the anger thereby excited, and the hatred and revenge from that anger, is there a lust for venting one's rage upon them. When such lust is active in everyone in a society where no external bonds restrain, such as the fear of the law, and of the loss of reputation, honour, gain, and life, everyone from the impulse of his own evil rushes upon another; and, so far as he prevails, subjugates the rest and subjects them to his dominion, and vents his rage with delight upon those who do not submit themselves. This delight is so intimately united with the delight of bearing rule that they exist in the same measure, since the delight of doing harm is contained in all enmity, envy, hatred, and revenge, which, as said above, are the evils of that love. All the hells are such societies, and in consequence every one there in his heart hates the other, and from hatred bursts forth into cruelty so far as he has power. These cruelties and their torments are also meant by infernal fire, for they are the effects of lusts. </p><p align="center">------------</p>

<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #573 (original Latin)</h4><p>573. Quia per ignem infernalem intelligitur omnis cupiditas malum faciendi profluens ex amore sui, inde etiam per eundem ignem intelligitur cruciatus qualis est in infernis: nam cupiditas ex illo amore est cupiditas nocendi aliis, qui se non honorant, venerantur et colunt; et quantum irae inde capiunt, et ex ira quantum odii et vindictae, tanta cupiditas est saeviendi in illos: et cum talis cupiditas inest unicuivis in societate, ubi non vincula externa coercent, quae sunt timores pro lege, proque jactura famae, honoris, lucri, et vitae, tunc quisque ex suo malo ruit in alterum, et quantum valet etiam subjugat, ac subjicit reliquos suo dominio et in illos qui se non submittunt, ex jucundo saevit. Hoc jucundum prorsus conjunctum est cum jucundo imperandi, usque adeo ut in simili gradu sint, quoniam jucundum nocendi inest inimicitiae, invidiae, odio et vindictae, quae sunt mala illius amoris, ut supra dictum est. Omnia inferna tales societates sunt; quare ibi quisque corde gerit odium contra alterum, ac ex odio erumpit in saeva, quantum valet. Hae saevitiae et inde cruciatus intelliguntur etiam per ignem infernalem, nam sunt effectus cupiditatum. </p>
