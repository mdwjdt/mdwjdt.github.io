<h3 align="center" class="ired">《天堂与地狱》 第534节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>534、通往天堂和地狱的道路曾展现在我的面前。有一条通向左边或北边的宽阔大道，只见有许多灵人走在上面。在远处，只见一块巨石在那道路的尽头。大道在巨石这里，分为两条路，一条向左，一条向右，方向正好相反。左边的是窄路或狭窄，从西方到南方，从而进入天堂之光中；右边的是宽路或宽阔，向下倾斜朝向地狱。刚开始时，所有人似乎都走在同一条大路上，直到岔路口的大石头前。一到这里，他们便分道扬镳：善人转向左边，进入通往天堂的窄路；恶人看不见岔路口的石头，跌倒在上面受了伤，他们起来后，向着右边朝向地狱的宽路奔跑。<br><br>
[2]后来，这一切的意义都向我解释：也就是说，第一条大路，许多善人和恶人一起走在上面，如同朋友那样彼此交谈，因为他们之间看上去没有什么明显的分别，这表示那些外表上过着相似的诚实、公正生活的人，彼此似乎没有什么不同；岔路口或拐角处的石头，恶人在此跌倒并由此沿着通往地狱的路奔跑，表示神性真理，它被那些注视地狱的人所拒绝。在最高的意义上，这石头表示主的神性人身。但那些同时承认神性真理和主之神性的人则被引到通往天堂的路上。这些事情再次表明，表面上看，恶人和善人过着同样的生活，或者走着同样的路，也就是说，这种人和那种人一样容易。然而，那些发自内心承认上帝的人，尤其是教会中那些承认主之神性的人，被引向天堂。不承认的人则被引向地狱。<br><br>
[3]在来世，路表示从人的意图或意志发出的思想。路完全依照这些意图的思想而显现在那里；每个人所走的路线，都与出于他意图的思想相一致。因此，从灵人所走的路就能知道灵人及其思想的品性。这些也清楚地说明了主的话的意思：<br><br>
你们要进窄门。因为引到灭亡，那门是宽的，路是大的，进去的人也多；引到永生，那门是窄的，路是小的，找着的人也少。（<a href="http://www.39-27.cn/太7.13.htm">马太福音7:13-14</a>）<br><br>
引到永生的路是窄的，不是因为它难走，而是因为找着的人少，正如此处经文所说的。我看到在那条大道尽头的拐角处，有一块大石头，由此分出方向截然相反的两条路，这说明了主的话的意思：<br><br>
你们没有读过经上所记的吗？“匠人所弃的石头已作了房角的头块石头，凡跌在那石头上的，必要跌碎。”（<a href="http://www.39-27.cn/路20.17.htm">路加福音20:17-18</a>）<br><br>
“石头”表示神性真理；“以色列的磐石”（<a href="http://www.39-27.cn/撒下23.3.htm">撒母耳记下23:3</a>）表示主的神性人身；“匠人”表示教会的信众；“房角的头块石头”是指分岔出那两条路的地方；“跌”并“跌碎”是指否认并灭亡。<a href="#a527">｛注1｝</a><br><br>
<a name="a527">｛注1｝</a>：“石头”表示真理（<a href="../ac/114.htm">114</a>，<a href="../ac/643.htm">643</a>，<a href="../ac/1298.htm">1298</a>，<a href="../ac/3720.htm">3720</a>，<a href="../ac/6426.htm">6426</a>，<a href="../ac/8609.htm">8609</a>，<a href="../ac/10376.htm">10376</a>）。因此，律法被刻写在石版上（<a href="../ac/10376.htm">10376</a>）。“以色列的磐石”表示主的神性真理和神性人身（<a href="../ac/6426.htm">6426</a>）。</p>

<p>534. 通往天堂的路和通往地狱的路曾被指给我看. 有一条大道伸向左边或北方, 只见许多灵人沿着这条道走; 但从远处看, 只见一块巨石在那条大道的尽头. 然后有两条路从这块巨石岔出, 一条向左, 一条向右, 方向正好相反. 左边的路又窄又小, 从西方绕到南方, 从而进入天堂之乐. 右边的路又宽又大, 倾斜而下, 通向地狱. 起初, 所有人似乎都走在同样的路上, 直到他们来到两条路尽头的巨石之处. 一到此处, 他们便分道扬镳; 善人转向左边, 踏上通向天堂的窄路; 而恶人因看不见交叉口的巨石而跌倒在上面并跌伤了; 起来以后, 他们沿着大道朝通往地狱的右边狂奔.<br><br>后来, 这一切的意义被解释给我. 第一条路, 也就是那条大道, 上面既有善人, 也有恶人, 他们一起行走, 如朋友那样彼此交谈, 并且他们之间看上去没有什么区别, 这代表从表面上看, 人们都过着诚实, 公义的生活, 并且他们之间似乎没有什么区别. 将恶人绊倒, 使他们由此奔向通往地狱之路的交叉口或拐角处的石头代表神性真理, 那些注视地狱的人弃绝这神性真理; 就至高意义而言, 这石头表示主的神性人身. 但那些承认神性真理, 也承认主的神性之人则沿着通往天堂的路走. 这再次向我表明, 就外在而言, 恶人和善人过着一样的生活, 或走在同样的路上, 也就是说, 这种人和那种人一样容易; 然而, 那些发自内心承认神性的人, 尤其教会中那些承认主的神性之人被引向天堂; 而那些不承认的人则被引向地狱.<br><br>在来世, 路代表从人的意图和意愿发出的思维; 路在那里照着这些意图的思维而显为可见; 每个人所走的路线, 都沿着他从意图所发出的思维. 因此, 灵人及其思维的品质从他们的路径就能得知. 这也清楚表明主的这些话是什么意思:<br><br>你们要进窄门, 因为引到灭亡, 那门是宽的, 路是大的, 进去的人也多; 引到永生, 那门是窄的, 路是小的, 找着的人也少. (<a href="3927/matthew_7_13.htm">马太福音 7:13-14</a>)<br><br>引到永生的路是窄的, 不是因为它难走, 而是因为找着的人少, 如此处经上所说的. 我所看到在共同所走的那条大道尽头的拐角处, 并由此岔出方向截然相反的两条路的那块巨石, 说明了主的这些话是什么意思:<br><br>经上记着: 匠人所弃的石头已作了房角的头块石头, 凡跌在那石头上的, 必要跌碎. (<a href="3927/luke_20_17.htm">路加福音 20:17-18</a>)<br><br>“石头”表示神性真理, “以色列的磐石”(<a href="3927/2-samuel_23_3.htm">撒母耳记下 23:3</a>)表示主的神性人身; “匠人”表示属教会的人; “房角的头块石头”是指那两条路所在之地; “跌”并“跌碎”是指否认并灭亡.<br><br>注: “石头”表示真理(<a href="../ac/114.htm">天国的奥秘 114</a>, <a href="../ac/643.htm">643</a>, <a href="../ac/1298.htm">1298</a>, <a href="../ac/3720.htm">3720</a>, <a href="../ac/6426.htm">6426</a>, <a href="../ac/8609.htm">8609</a>, <a href="../ac/10376.htm">10376</a>节). 因此, 律法被刻写在石版上(<a href="../ac/10376.htm">天国的奥秘 10376</a>节). “以色列的磐石”表示主的神性真理和神性人身(<a href="../ac/6426.htm">天国的奥秘 6426</a>节). </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>534. 我曾被指示通往天國和通往地獄的路。有一條大道延向左方或北方。有許多靈走在大道上。在遠處, 我看到大路的盡頭有一塊很大的石頭。路在石頭處分為兩條, 一條通向左, 一條通向右。通向左邊的是一條窄路, 從西方繞到南方, 引入天國的光明之中。通向右邊的是一條寬路, 傾斜而下, 引向地獄。<br><br>起初, 每個人都走同一條路, 直到交叉口的大石頭處, 然後分道揚鑣。善人轉向左, 沿著通向天國的窄路前進。惡人甚至看不見交叉口的大石頭而撞傷自己, 起來以後, 他們沿著通向地獄的寬路快速前進。<br><br>後來, 這些事的寓意被解釋於我。善人和惡人一起沿大道前進, 相互交談, 如同朋友, 看似無任何分別, 象徵人們從表面看來, 都過著誠實公平的生活, 沒有分別。交叉口的石頭象徵神性真理, 否認真理, 注視地獄的惡人在此跌倒, 奔向通往地獄的路。在至高的意義上, 石頭象徵主神聖之人。承認神性真理和主的神聖之人者, 則被引入通往天國的路。<br><br>這同樣說明, 表面看來, 惡人和善人過著一樣的生活, 沿著同樣的路前進。然而, 從心裡承認上帝, 特別是教內承認主的神聖之人者, 被引向天國, 反之則被引入地獄。<br><br>在心靈世界, 道路象徵從目標和意圖所流出的思維。心靈世界所顯現的路, 與目標所流出的思維相應。人所取的路, 與目標所流出的思維一致。正因如此, 從靈所走的路, 可洞察其思維的品質。這也讓我明白了主的話, 祂說:"你們要進窄門, 因為引到滅亡, 那門是寬的, 路是大的, 進去的人也多;引到永生, 那門是窄的, 路是小的, 找著的人也少。"(<a href="3927/matthew_7_13.htm">馬太福音7:13-14</a>)引到永生的路是窄的, 不是因為它難走, 而是因為找著的人少, 正如主所說的。我看到大路盡頭有一塊石頭, 兩條路從此分出, 通往兩個不同的方向。這也讓我明白了主的話, 祂說:"匠人所棄的石頭已作了房角的頭塊石頭, 凡掉在那石頭上的, 必要跌碎。"(<a href="3927/luke_20_17.htm">路加福音20:17-18</a>)"石頭"表神性真理,"以色列的磐石"表示主的神性之人,"匠人"表教會的信徒,"在房角的頭塊石頭上跌碎"表示因否認真理<br><br>而滅亡。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #534 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>534. I was once shown the way to heaven and the way to hell. There was a broad path leading off to the left or north. There seemed to be a great many spirits traveling along it. In the distance, though, I could see a fairly large boulder where the broad path ended. Then two paths led off from the boulder, one to the left and the other, on the other side, to the right. The path to the left was narrow and confined, leading around through the west to the south, and therefore into the light of heaven. The path to the right was broad and open, leading obliquely down toward hell. <br><br>At first, everyone was clearly following the same path as far as the large boulder at the fork; but at that point they parted company. The good turned to the left and started along the confined path that led to heaven. The evil did not even see the boulder at the fork but fell over it and hurt themselves. When they got up, they rushed along the broad path to the right that led toward hell.<p> </p><p>[2] Later, the meaning of all this was explained to me. The first path, the broad one where so many good and evil people were traveling together, chatting with each other like friends with no visible difference between them, pictured people who live similarly honest and fair outward lives, with no visible difference between them. The stone at the fork or corner where the evil people stumbled, from which they rushed along the path to hell, pictured divine truth, which is denied by people who are focusing on hell. In the highest sense this stone meant the Lord's divine human nature. However, people who acknowledge divine truth and the divine nature of the Lord as well were taken along the path that led to heaven. <br><br>This showed me again that both evil and good people live the same life outwardly, or travel the same path, one as readily as the other. Yet the ones who at heart acknowledge the Divine, especially those within the church who acknowledge the Lord's divine nature, are led to heaven; while those who do not acknowledge it are led to hell.<p> </p><p>[3] Paths in the other life picture the thoughts that flow from our aims or intentions. The paths that are presented to view there answer exactly to the thoughts of our aims, and our course follows the thoughts that flow from our aims. This is why you can tell the quality of spirits and of their thoughts from their paths. This also showed me the meaning of the Lord's words, "Enter through the narrow gate, for broad is the gate and open the way that leads to destruction, and there are many who walk along it; confined is the path and narrow the gate that leads to life, and there are few who find it" (<a href="3927/matthew_7_13.htm">Matthew 7:13-14</a>). The way that leads to life is not narrow because it is difficult but because so few people find it, as stated. <br><br>The boulder I saw at the corner where the broad, common path ended and the two ways seemed to lead in opposite directions showed me the meaning of the Lord's words, "Have you not read what is written, 'The stone that the builders rejected has become the head of the corner'? Whoever falls over this stone will be shattered" (<a href="3927/luke_20_17.htm">Luke 20:17-18</a>). The stone means divine truth, and the rock of Israel means the Lord in regard to his divine human nature. The builders are the people of the church. The head of the corner is where the fork is, and to fall and be shattered is to deny and perish. <sup>1</sup><br><br><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br><div><p>1.&nbsp;A stone means truth: <a href="../ac/114.htm">Arcana Coelestia 114</a>, <a href="../ac/643.htm">643</a>, <a href="../ac/1298.htm">1298</a>, <a href="../ac/3720.htm">3720</a>, <a href="../ac/6426.htm">6426</a>, <a href="../ac/8609.htm">8609</a>, <a href="../ac/10376.htm">10376</a>.

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #534 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p>534. The way that leads to heaven, and the way that leads to hell were once represented to me. There was a broad way tending towards the left or the north, and many spirits were seen going in it; but at a distance a quite large stone was seen where the broad way came to an end. From that stone two ways there branched off, one to the left and one in the opposite direction to the right. The way that went to the left was narrow or restricted, leading through the west to the south, and thus into the light of heaven; the way that went to the right was broad and spacious, leading obliquely downwards towards hell. All at first seemed to be going the same way until they came to the large stone at the place where two ways met. When they reached that point they were separated; the good turned to the left and entered the restricted way that led to heaven; while the evil, not seeing the stone at the fork of the ways, fell upon it and were hurt; and when they rose up they ran on in the broad way to the right which went towards hell. <p> </p><p>[2] What all these things signified was afterwards explained to me: namely, that by the first way which was broad, wherein many both good and evil went together and talked with each other as friends, because there was no visible difference between them, were represented those who in externals live alike honestly and justly, and between whom seemingly there is no difference. By the stone where the two ways met or at the corner, upon which the evil fell and from which they then ran along the way leading to hell, was represented the Divine Truth, which is rejected by those who look towards hell; and in the highest sense by this stone was signified the Lord's Divine Human. But those who at the same time acknowledged the Truth and the Divine of the Lord were borne along the way that led to heaven. From these things again it was clear that in externals the evil lead the same kind of life as the good, or go the same way, that is, one as readily as the other; and yet that those who from the heart acknowledge the Divine, especially those within the Church who acknowledge the Divine of the Lord, are led to heaven; while those who do not are borne to hell. <p> </p><p>[3] The thoughts of man that proceed from his intention or will are represented in the other life by ways; and ways are visibly presented there in exact accord with those thoughts of intention; and in accord with his thoughts that proceed from intention everyone walks. For this reason the character of spirits and their thoughts are known from their ways. From these things also it is clear what is meant by the Lord's words: <br><br>Enter ye in through the narrow gate; for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction, and many are those who walk along it; for straitened is the way and narrow the gate that leadeth to life, and few be they who find it. <a href="3927/matthew_7_13.htm">Matthew 7:13-14</a>. <br><br>The way that leads to life is straitened not because it is difficult but because there are few who find it, as is said here. By the stone seen at the corner where the broad and common way ended, and from which two ways were seen to lead in opposite directions, is illustrated what is signified by these words of the Lord: <br><br>Have ye not read what is written? The stone which the builders rejected was made the head of the corner. Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken. <a href="3927/luke_20_17.htm">Luke 20:17-18</a>. <br><br>"Stone" signifies Divine Truth, and "the stone of Israel" the Lord in respect of His Divine Human; the "builders" are those who are of the Church; "the head of the corner" is where the two ways are; "to fall" and "to be broken" is to deny and perish. <sup>1</sup><br><br><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br><div><p>1.&nbsp;"Stone" signifies truth (<a href="../ac/114.htm">Arcana Coelestia 114</a>, <a href="../ac/643.htm">643</a>, <a href="../ac/1298.htm">1298</a>, <a href="../ac/3720.htm">3720</a>, <a href="../ac/6426.htm">6426</a>, <a href="../ac/8609.htm">8609</a>, <a href="../ac/10376.htm">10376</a>). <br><br>For this reason the law was inscribed on tables of stone (<a href="../ac/10376.htm">Arcana Coelestia 10376</a>). <br><br>"The stone of Israel" means the Lord in respect of the Divine Truth and His Divine Human (<a href="../ac/6426.htm">Arcana Coelestia 6426</a>). </p></div><p align="center">------------</p>

<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #534 (original Latin)</h4><p>534. Repraesentata mihi quondam est via quae ducit ad caelum, et quae ducit ad infernum. Erat via lata tendens sinistrorsum seu versus septentrionem; apparebant multi spiritus qui illam ibant: sed ad distantiam visus est lapis satis magnus, ubi via lata terminabatur. Ex illo lapide dein binae viae abibant, una ad sinistrum, et una ex opposito ad dextrum. Via quae tendebat ad sinistrum erat angusta seu stricta, ducens per occidentem ad meridiem, et sic in lucem caeli via quae tendebat ad dextrum erat lata et spatiosa, ducens oblique deorsum versus infernum. Omnes primum visi sunt eandem viam ire, usque ad lapidem magnum in bivio; sed cum illuc venerunt, separati sunt; boni deflectebant ad sinistrum, et intrabant viam strictam quae ducebat ad caelum; at mali non videbant lapidem in bivio. et cadebant super illum, ac laesi sunt, et cum surrexerint percurrebant viam latam ad dextrum, quae tendebat ad infernum.<br><br> <br>[2] Postea explicatum est mihi, quid omnia illa significabant: quod nempe per viam primam, quae lata, quam multi tam boni quam mali simul ibant, et colloquebantur inter se sicut amici, quia nullum discrimen inter illos apparebat ad visum, repraesentati sint qui in externis sincere et juste similiter vivunt, et qui non dignoscuntur ad visum: per lapidem bivii seu anguli, in quem ceciderunt mali, et a quo dein percurrebant viam ducentem ad infernum, repraesentatum est Divinum Verum, quod negatur ab illis qui spectant ad infernum; in supremo sensu per eundem lapidem significabatur Divinum Humanum Domini qui autem agnoscebant Verum, et simul Divinum Domini, illi ferebantur per viam quae ducebat ad caelum. Ex his iterum patuit, quod mali aeque ac boni eandem vitam agant in externis, seu eandem viam eant, ita tam facile unus quam alter; et tamen quod illi qui agnoscunt Divinum ex corde, imprimis intra ecclesiam, qui agnoscunt Divinum Domini, ducantur ad caelum; et qui non agnoscunt, ferantur ad infernum.<br><br> <br>[3] Hominis cogitationes quae procedunt ex intentione seu voluntate, repraesentantur in altera vita per vias: sistuntur etiam viae ad apparentiam ibi prorsus secundum cogitationes intentionis, et quoque unusquisque secundum cogitationes suas quae procedunt ex intentione ambulat.
