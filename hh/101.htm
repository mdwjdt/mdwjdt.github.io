<p>101. 尤其必须清楚的是, 与天堂的一切对应就是与主的神性人身的对应, 因为天堂来自主, 祂就是天堂, 这在前面的章节已经说明. 事实上, 若神性人身不流入天堂的一切事物, 并照对应流入尘世的一切事物, 无论天使还是世人, 都不可能存在. 由此再次明显可知主为何变成人, 并从初至末给祂的神性披上一个人身. 这是因为在主降世之前, 作为天堂源头的神性人身已不足以支撑万物, 因为作为天堂根基的人类破坏并摧毁了秩序. 至于主降世前存在的神性人身的性质和品质, 以及那时天堂的状况, 可参看前一章的摘录. </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>101. 有必要知道, 一切與天國的對應都是與主的神性之人對應, 因為天國源於主, 主就是天國, 這在前面已作解釋。若非主的神性之人流入天國的一切細節之處, 又照對應流入人間的每一處, 就不會有天國天人, 也不會有世上凡人。<br><br>由此可知主為何要降世成為一個人, 始終以人性披掛於神性之外。原因在於主降臨以前, 作為天國之根基的人類已逐漸損害乃至摧毀了神性設計之規則(稱為"聖規"), 導致天國所依賴的神性之人已不足以維繫萬有。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #101 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>101. It is absolutely necessary to realize, though, that all correspondence with heaven is correspondence with the Lord's divine human, because heaven is from him and because he is heaven, as has been explained in the preceding chapters. For unless the divine human flowed into every bit of heaven and, in accord with correspondences, into every bit of our world, there would be no angels and none of us. <br><br>Again then, we can see from this why the Lord became an individual on earth and clothed his divine nature with a human nature from first to last. This happened because the divine human on which heaven depended before the Coming of the Lord was no longer adequate to sustain everything, since we, the foundation of heaven, had undermined and destroyed the design. <br><br>In the passages referred to at the close of the preceding chapter you may see what the divine human before the Coming of the Lord was and what its nature was, as well as the quality of the state of heaven then. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #101 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p>101. A truth that must by all means be known is that all correspondence with heaven is with the Lord's Divine Human, because heaven is from Him and He is heaven, as has been shown in previous sections. For if the Divine Human did not inflow into all things of the world, there would be neither angel nor man. From this, again, it is evident why the Lord became Man, and clothed His Divine with a Human from first to last. It was because the Divine Human which was the source of heaven before the Lord's coming was no longer sufficient to sustain all things, for the reason that man, who is the foundation of the heavens, had weakened and destroyed order. The nature and quality of the Divine Human which was before the coming of the Lord, and what the condition of heaven was at that time, may be seen in collected extracts appended to the preceding section. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #101 (Ager, 1900)</h4><p>101. Especially it must be understood that all correspondence with heaven is with the Lord's Divine Human, because heaven is from Him, and He is heaven, as has been shown in previous chapters. For if the Divine Human did not flow into all things of heaven, and in accordance with correspondences into all things of the world, no angel or man could exist. From this again it is evident why the Lord became Man and clothed His Divine from first to last with a Human. It was because the Divine Human, from which heaven existed before the Lord's coming, was no longer sufficient to sustain all things, for the reason that man, who is the foundation of the heavens, had subverted and destroyed order. What the Divine Human was before the Lord's coming, and what the condition of heaven was at that time may be seen in the extracts appended to the preceding chapter. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #101 (original Latin)</h4><p>101. Verum omnino sciendum est, quod omnis correspondentia, quae cum caelo, sit cum Divino Humano Domini, quoniam ab Ipso est caelum, et Ipse est caelum, ut in articulis praecedentibus ostensum est; nam nisi Divinum Humanum influeret in omnia caeli, et secundum correspondentias in omnia mundi, non daretur angelus, nec daretur homo. Inde iterum patet, cur Dominus factus est Homo, ac induit Divinum suum Humano a primo ad ultimum, quod fuerit, quoniam Divinum Humanum, ex quo caelum ante adventum Domini, non amplius suffecit ad sustentandum omnia, quia homo, qui basis caelorum, labefactavit et destruxit ordinem. Quid et quale Divinum Humanum, quod ante adventum Domini fuit, et qualis status caeli tunc, vide in Collectis ad caput praecedens. </p>
