<h3 align="center" class="ired">《天堂与地狱》 第596节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>596、天堂分为两个国度，即属天的国度和属灵的国度（参看第<a href="../hh/20.htm">20</a>-<a href="../hh/28.htm">28</a>节）；同样地，地狱也分为两个国度，一个与属天的国度对立，另一个与属灵的国度对立。与属天的国度对立的地狱在西方，住在那里的被称为“魔鬼”；与属灵的国度对立的地狱在北方和南方，住在那里的被称为“恶灵”。（参见第<a href="../hh/123.htm">123</a>节注释）<br><br>
属天国度的人都处在对主的爱中，与该国度对立的地狱之人都沉溺在自我之爱中；而属灵国度的人都处在对邻舍的爱中，与该国度对立的地狱之人则沉溺在世界之爱中。显然，对主的爱和对自我的爱是对立面；同样地，对邻舍的爱和对世界的爱是对立面。主始终确保，没有任何东西从与主的属天国度对立的地狱里流向住在属灵国度的人，因为如果不这样，属灵的国度就会灭亡，原因如前所述（参见第<a href="../hh/578.htm">578</a>-<a href="../hh/579.htm">579</a>节）。这是主不断维持的两个普遍的平衡。</p>
<p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>596. 天堂被分为两个国度, 即属天国度和属灵国度(参看<a href="20.htm">20-28</a>节). 地狱同样被分为两个国度, 一个与属天国度对立, 一个与属灵国度对立. 与属天国度对立的地狱在西方, 住在那里的人被称为魔鬼; 与属灵国度对立的地狱在北方和南方, 住在那里的人被称为灵人. 凡在属天国度的人都处于对主之爱, 凡在对立于该国度的地狱之人都陷入自我之爱; 而凡在属灵国度的人都处于对邻之爱, 凡在对立于该国度的地狱之人则陷入尘世之爱. 我由此看出, 对主之爱和自我之爱是对立面; 同样, 对邻之爱和尘世之爱是对立面. 主始终确保与主的属天国度对立的地狱所流出之物, 无一流向住在属灵国度的人. 如果真有这种事发生, 属灵国度必要灭亡, 原因如前所述(<a href="../ac/578.htm">天国的奥秘 578-579</a>节). 这些就是主不断维持的两个基本平衡. </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>596. 天國分為兩類國度, 一為仁智天國, 一為義信天國。照樣, 地獄也分為兩類國度, 一類與仁智對立, 一類與義信對立。前者位於西方, 住在那裡的靈被稱為"惡魔;"後者位於北方和南方, 住在那裡的靈被稱為"邪靈"。<br><br>仁智天人都專注於對主之仁, 與之對立的地獄惡魔皆沉迷于愛自己(即我欲);義信天人都專注於對人之義, 與之對立的地獄邪靈則沉迷於愛世界(即物欲)。由此我看出, 對主之仁和自我之欲是對立的, 對人之義與對物質之欲是對立的。<br><br>主始終確保與仁智天國對立的地獄之氣流不致流向義信天國的天人, 要是那樣的話, 義信天國必要毀滅。<br><br>這就是主始終保守的兩個主要的平衡。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #596 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>596. The heavens are differentiated into two kingdoms, the heavenly kingdom and the spiritual kingdom (see above, <a href="20.htm">20-28</a>). Similarly, the hells are differentiated into two kingdoms, one opposite to the heavenly kingdom and one opposite the spiritual kingdom. The one opposite to the heavenly kingdom is in the western quarter, and the people who live there are called demons; while the one that is opposite to the spiritual kingdom is in the northern and southern quarter, and the people who live there are called spirits.<br><br>All the people in the heavenly kingdom are involved in a love for the Lord, and all the people in the hells opposite to that kingdom are involved in love for themselves. All the people who are in the spiritual kingdom are involved in love for their neighbor, and all the people who are in the hells opposite to that kingdom are involved in love of the world. This has enabled me to see that love for the Lord and love for oneself are opposites, as are love for our neighbor and love of the world.<br><br>The Lord is constantly taking care that nothing should flow out from the hells opposite to the Lord's heavenly kingdom toward the people who are in the spiritual kingdom. If this were to happen, the spiritual kingdom would be destroyed, for the reasons given in <a href="578.htm">578-579</a> above. <br><br>These are the two general balances that the Lord is constantly keeping intact. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #596 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p> 596. There are two kingdoms into which the heavens are distinguished, namely, the celestial kingdom and the spiritual kingdom (of which see above, <a href="20.htm">20-38</a>). In like manner the hells are distinguished into two kingdoms, one of which is opposite to the celestial kingdom and the other opposite to the spiritual kingdom. That which is opposite to the celestial kingdom is in the western quarter, and those who are in it are called genii; and that which is opposite to the spiritual kingdom is in the northern and southern quarters, and those who are in it are called spirits. All who are in the celestial kingdom are in love to the Lord, and all who are in the hells opposite to that kingdom are in the love of self; while all who are in the spiritual kingdom are in love towards the neighbour, and all who are in the hells opposite to that kingdom are in the love of the world. Evidently, then, love to the Lord and the love of self are opposites; and in like manner love towards the neighbour and the love of the world are opposites. The Lord continually provides that there shall be no outflowing from the hells that are opposite the Lord's celestial kingdom towards those who are in the spiritual kingdom; for if this were done the spiritual kingdom would perish (for the reason given above, <a href="578.htm">578-579</a>). These are the two general equilibria that are unceasingly maintained by the Lord. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #596 (Ager, 1900)</h4><p>596. There are two kingdoms into which the heavens are divided, the celestial kingdom and the spiritual kingdom (of which see (Heaven and Hell above, n.<a href="20.htm">20-28</a>). In like manner the hells are divided into two kingdoms, one of which is opposite to the celestial kingdom and the other opposite to the spiritual kingdom. That which is opposite to the celestial kingdom is in the western quarter, and those who are in it are called genii; and that which is opposite to the spiritual kingdom is in the northern and southern quarters, and those which are in it are called spirits. All who are in the celestial kingdom are in love to the Lord, and all who are in the hells opposite to that kingdom are in the love of self; while all who are in the spiritual kingdom are in love towards the neighbor, and all who are in the hells opposite to that kingdom are in love of the world. Evidently, then, love to the Lord and the love of self are opposites; and in like manner love towards the neighbor and love of the world are opposites. The Lord continually provides that there shall be no outflowing from the hells that are opposite the Lord's celestial kingdom towards those who are in the spiritual kingdom; for if this were done the spiritual kingdom would perish (for the reason given above , n.<a href="578.htm">578, 579</a>). These are the two general equilibriums that are unceasingly maintained by the Lord. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #596 (original Latin)</h4><p>596. Sunt duo regna, in quae caeli distincti sunt, nempe regnum caeleste et regnum spirituale (de quibus videatur supra, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_596/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_20" target=_top>20-28</a>). Similiter sunt duo regna in quae inferna distincta sunt; unum horum regnorum est oppositum regno caelesti, et alterum est oppositum regno spirituali. Illud quod oppositum est regno caelesti est in plaga occidentali, et illi, qui ibi sunt, vocantur genii; id autem quod oppositum est regno spirituali est in plaga septentrionali et meridionali, et illi, qui ibi sunt, vocantur spiritus. Omnes qui in regno caelesti sunt, in amore in Dominum sunt et omnes qui in infernis illi regno oppositis sunt, in amore sui sunt: at omnes qui in regno spirituali sunt, in amore erga proximum sunt at omnes qui in infernis illi regno oppositis sunt, in amore mundi sunt. Inde patuit, quod amor in Dominum et amor sui sint oppositi; similiter amor erga proximum et amor mundi. Providetur jugiter a Domino, ut non aliquid effluat ex infernis oppositis regno caelesti Domini versus illos qui in regno spirituali sunt; nam si hoc fieret, periret regnum spirituale; causa videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_596/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_578" target=_top>578</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_596/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_579" target=_top>579</a>). Haec duo communia aequilibria sunt, quae a Domino jugiter sarta conservantur. </p>
