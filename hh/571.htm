<h3 align="center" class="ired">《天堂与地狱》 第571节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>571、由于“地狱之火”表示出于自我之爱和世界之爱的作恶的欲望，而且是地狱里所有人的欲望（如前一节所述），所以，当地狱被打开时，会出现冒烟的火，就像在火灾中所看到的大火。炽烈的火焰是从自我之爱所统治的地狱升起的，闪烁的火焰是从世界之爱所统治的地狱升起的。然而，当地狱被关上时，这火就不见了，取而代之的是一种朦胧，像是由浓烟凝聚而成。火仍在里面肆虐，这能从它散发出的热气看出来，就像火灾后烧毁的废墟散发出的热气，有的地方像是从炽热的火炉散发出的热气，另一些地方像是热水浴的热气。当这热气流进人里面时，会激起人的欲望，使恶人满怀仇恨和报复，使病态的人变得疯狂。处于上述爱中的人有这样的火或这样的热，是因为他们的灵附属于那些地狱，甚至生活在肉身时就这样了。但应该知道的是，那些在地狱里的人不是在火里，火是一种表象。那里的人没有燃烧的感觉，只有他们在世时所感受到的那种温暖。显为火是由于对应，因为爱与火对应，在灵界所看到的一切事物都是依照对应看到的。</p>

<p>571. 由于地狱之火表示出于爱自己, 爱世界的作恶欲望, 并且这种欲望是地狱里所有人的特性(如前一章所述), 所以当地狱被打开时, 人就会看见那种冒烟的火, 就像在火灾中所看到的火. 烈火是从自我之爱所盛行的地狱冒出来的, 闪烁的火是从尘世之爱所盛行的地狱冒出来的. 不过, 当地狱被关闭时, 这火就不见了, 取而代之的是某种像是由浓烟制成的幽暗之物. 然而, 火仍在里面迅速蔓延; 对此, 你能从所散发出的热看出来. 它就像火灾过后从烧毁的废墟中冒出的热气, 有时像烧热的火炉冒出的热气, 有时像热澡水冒出的热气. 当这热流入人时, 它会激起人的欲望; 激起恶人里面的仇恨和报复, 以及病态者里面的疯狂. 这种火或热就是那些陷入上述两种爱之人的特征, 因为就其灵而言, 他们活在肉身时就已经与地狱相通. 不过, 需要知道的是, 地狱里的人并非真的在火里; 火只是一种表象. 他们也并非真的感受到任何焚烧, 只感受到他们在世时所知道的一种温暖. 火的这种表象是由于对应, 因为爱对应于火, 灵界所看到的一切事物都照对应显为可见. </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>571. 正因地獄之火象徵我欲和物欲所驅動的作惡的欲望, 且是地獄所有人的特性(參上一章), 是故當地獄之門被打開的時候, 就有煙霧和火焰冒出來。從我欲盛行的地獄所冒出的是濃烈的火, 從物欲盛行的地獄所冒出的是閃爍的火。<br><br>當地獄之門重新封上時, 火就不見了, 只見一片黑暗, 好像一團濃密的煙霧。但是, 火依然在裡面燃燒, 因為它冒著熱氣, 有時像火災過後從廢墟中冒出的熱氣, 有時像燃燒的火爐所冒出的熱氣, 有時像熱水浴所冒出的熱氣。當它流入人心時, 就激起人的欲望。惡人生起仇恨和報復, 愚昧人則變得瘋狂。<br><br>這火(或熱)是所有陷入愛自己和愛世界者的共同特徵, 因為即使在肉身之時, 他們的靈魂已與地獄相通。<br><br>只是我們要知道, 地獄之人並非真的在火中焚燒。火只是表像。他們也沒有被火焚燒的痛楚, 所感受的只是在人間已熟知的欲火。烈火燃燒之相是出於對應, 因為欲與火對應。不僅如此, 心靈世界所現的一切相都是出於對應。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #571 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>571. Because hellfire means the urge to do the evils prompted by love for oneself and the world, and because this kind of urge is characteristic of everyone in hell (see the preceding chapter), when the hells are opened one sees the kind of smoky fire you get in conflagrations. An intense fire rises from the hells where love for oneself rules, and a flickering one from the hells where love of the world rules. <br><br>When the hells are closed, though, this fire is not visible. Instead, there is something dark, as though made from thickened smoke. Still, that fire is raging inside, as you can tell from the radiating heat. It is like the heat of ruins after a conflagration, or in some instances like the heat of an active furnace, or in others like that of a hot bath. When this heat flows into us it rouses our cravings - hatred and vengefulness in evil people, and dementia in the ill. <br><br>This kind of fire or heat is characteristic of people who are engrossed in the aforementioned loves because in spirit they are in touch with these hells even while they are still living in their bodies. <br><br>It does need to be known, though, that the people in the hells are not actually in fire. The fire is an appearance. They do not actually feel any burning, only the kind of warmth they knew in the world. The reason there seems to be fire is correspondence, since love corresponds to fire, and everything we see in the spiritual world has its visible form from its correspondence. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #571 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p> 571. Because the lust of doing the evils that are from the love of self and of the world is meant by "infernal fire", and because such is the lust of all in the hells (as shown in the foregoing section) therefore also when the hells are opened there is an appearance of fire with smoke, such as is seen in conflagrations, a dense fire from the hells where the love of self reigns, and a flaming fire from the hells where love of the world reigns. When, however, the hells are closed, this fiery appearance is not seen, but in its place there is a kind of obscurity like the condensation from smoke; yet the fire still rages within, as can be seen by the heat exhaling therefrom, which is like the heat from the burnt ruins after a fire, and in some places like the heat from a heated furnace, in others like the heat from a hot bath. When this heat inflows with man it excites lusts in him, and with evil men hatred and revenge, and with the sick insanities. They who are in the above-mentioned loves have such a fire or such a heat since as to their spirit they are attached to those hells, even while living in the body. But it ought to be known that those who are in the hells are not in fire; the fire is an appearance. Those there are conscious of no burning, but only of a warmth like that which they had felt when in the world. This appearance of fire is from correspondence, for love corresponds to fire, and all the things seen in the spiritual world are seen in accordance with correspondences. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #571 (Ager, 1900)</h4><p>571. As the lust of doing the evils that are from the love of self and of the world is meant by "infernal fire," and as such is the lust of all in the hells (as shown in the foregoing chapter) so when the hells are opened there is an appearance of fire with smoke, such as is seen in conflagrations, a dense fire from the hells where the love of self prevails, and a flaming fire from the hells where love of the world prevails. But when the hells are closed this fiery appearance is not seen, but in its place there is a kind of obscurity like a condensation of smoke; although the fire still rages within, as can be seen by the heat exhaling therefrom, which is like the heat from the burnt ruins after a fire, and in some places like the heat from a heated furnace, in others like the heat from a hot bath. When this heat flows into man it excites lusts in him, and in evil men hatred and revenge, and in the sick insanities. Such is the fire or such the heat that affects those who are in the above-mentioned loves, because in respect to their spirit they are attached to those hells, even while living in the body. But it must be understood that those who are in the hells are not in fire; the fire is an appearance; those there are conscious of no burning, but only of a warmth like that which they had felt when in the world. This appearance of fire is from correspondence, since love corresponds to fire, and all things seen in the spiritual world are seen in accordance with correspondences. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #571 (original Latin)</h4><p>571. Quia cupiditas faciendi mala, quae sunt ex amore sui et mundi, intelligitur per "ignem infernalem," et quia talis cupiditas est omnium in infernis, (videatur praecedens articulus,) ideo quoque cum inferna aperiuntur, apparet sicut igneum cum fumo, quale solet esse in incendiis; igneum densum ex infernis ubi amor sui regnat, ac flammeum ex infernis ubi amor mundi. Cum autem clausa sunt, non apparet id igneum, sed loco ejus sicut obscurum quid condensatum a fumo: aestuat usque igneum illud intus, quod etiam apperceptum est ex calore inde exhalato, qui calor est sicut ex combustis post incendium, alicubi sicut ex fornace incalescente, et alibi sicut ex calido balnei; quod calidum cum influit apud hominem, excitat apud illum cupiditates, et apud malos odia et vindictas, et apud aegrotos insanias. Talis ignis aut talis calor est illis qui in supradictis amoribus sunt, quoniam alligati sunt quoad spiritus suos illis infernis, etiam cum vivunt in corpore. Sed sciendum est, quod illi, qui in infernis sunt, non in igne sint, sed quod ignis sit apparentia non enim aliquam ustionem ibi sentiunt, sed modo calorem qualem prius in mundo. Quod ignis appareat, est ex correspondentia nam amor correspondet igni: et omnia quae in mundo spirituali apparent, secundum correspondentias apparent. </p>
