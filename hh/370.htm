<h3 align="center" class="ired">《天堂与地狱》 第370节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>370、天使告诉我，配偶双方越亲密地结合，就越在婚姻之爱中，也在同样的程度上处在聪明、智慧和幸福中，因为，作为一切聪明、智慧和幸福源头的神性真理和神性良善主要流入婚姻之爱中，因此，婚姻之爱，由于它同时是良善和真理的婚姻，是神性流注的真正平面。因为这爱，正如它是理智与意志的结合，也是真理和良善的结合，因为理智接受神性真理并由真理形成，意志接受神性良善并由良善形成。因为人所意愿的，对他来说就是良善；人所理解的，对他来说就是真理；因此，无论你说理智和意志的结合，还是说真理和良善的结合，都是一样的。真理和良善的结合造就了天使，也造成就了他的聪明、智慧和幸福；天使之所以成为天使，取决于他里面的真理与良善的结合和良善与真理的结合，换言之，取决于他的爱与信的结合和信与爱的结合。</p>

<p>370. 天使告诉我, 配偶双方越结合, 就越处于婚姻之爱, 同时越处于聪明, 智慧和快乐. 因为作为一切聪明, 智慧和快乐源头的神性真理和神性良善主要流入婚姻之爱; 因此, 婚姻之爱是神性流注的本质层面, 因为它本身是良善与真理的婚姻. 事实上, 这爱因是理解力与意愿的结合, 故也是真理与良善的结合, 因为理解力接受神性真理, 从真理形成, 意愿接受神性良善, 从良善形成. 事实上, 凡人所意愿的, 对他来说就是良善; 凡他所理解的, 对他来说就是真理. 因此, 无论你说理解力与意愿的结合, 还是说真理与良善的结合, 意思都一样. 真理与良善的结合构成天使, 也构成他的聪明, 智慧和快乐. 天使的实际性质取决于在他们里面, 真理如何被联结于良善, 良善又如何被联结于真理. 换句话说, 天使的性质取决于他们的爱如何被联结于他们的信, 他们的信又如何被联结于他们的爱. </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>370. 天人告訴我, 配偶雙方結合越深, 婚愛就越濃, 聰明, 智慧,<br><br>快樂的程度也越高。因為聖理與聖善作啟一切聰明, 智慧, 快樂的源頭流入婚愛之中, 也就是說, 婚愛是神性流注的主要載體, 因為它本身就是真理與良善的結合(婚姻之愛是認知與意志的結合, 因而也是真理與良善的結合)。因為認知是聖理的載體, 從真理而成形;意志是聖善的載體, 從良善而成形。事實上, 對每個人而言, 凡其所意志皆被視為善, 凡其所認知皆被認為理。所以, 或說認知與意志結合, 或說真理與良善結合, 兩者是一致的。<br><br>真理與良善的結合成就了天人, 也構成了天人的聰明, 智慧及快樂。天人的品性, 取決於真理與良善結合的程度。換言之, 天人的品性取決於仁與信結合的程度。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #370 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>370. I have been told by angels that the more two spouses are engaged in this kind of union, the more they are caught up in marriage love and, at the same time, in intelligence, wisdom, and happiness. This is because divine truth and divine good, the source of all intelligence, wisdom, and happiness, flow primarily into marriage love. This means that marriage love is the essential matrix for the divine inflow because it is itself a marriage of the true and the good. This in turn is because the nature of the union of intellect and volition determines the nature of the union of the true and the good because the intellect is a receptor of divine truth, being formed from truths, while volition is a receptor of divine good and is actually formed from things good. In fact, whatever we intend is good in our estimation, and whatever we understand is true for us. This is why it is all the same whether you talk about the union of intellect and intent or the union of the true and the good. <br><br>The union of the true and the good makes an angel, and also makes angels' intelligence, wisdom, and happiness. The actual nature of angels depends on how what is true in them is united to what is good, and what is good is united to what is true. In other words, the nature of angels depends on the way their love is united to their faith and their faith to their love. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #370 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p>370. I have been told by angels that so far as a married pair are so conjoined they are in conjugial love, and also to the same extent in intelligence, wisdom and happiness, because Divine Truth and Divine Good, which are the source of all intelligence, wisdom, and happiness, flow chiefly into conjugial love; consequently conjugial love, since there is at the same time a marriage of good and truth, is the very plane of Divine influx. For that love, as it is a conjunction of the understanding and will, is also a conjunction of truth and good, since the understanding receives Divine Truth and is formed out of truths, and the will receives Divine Good and is formed out of goods. For what a man wills is to him good, and what he understands is to him truth; therefore it is the same whether you say conjunction of understanding and will or conjunction of truth and good. Conjunction of truth and good is what makes an angel; it also makes his intelligence, wisdom, and happiness; for an angel is an angel accordingly as good in him is conjoined with truth and truth with good; or what is the same, accordingly as the love pertaining to him is conjoined with faith and faith with love. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #370 (Ager, 1900)</h4><p>370. I have been told by angels that so far as a married pair are so conjoined they are in marriage love, and also to the same extent in intelligence, wisdom and happiness, because Divine truth and Divine good which are the source of all intelligence, wisdom, and happiness, flow chiefly into marriage love; consequently marriage love, since it is also the marriage of good and truth, is the very plane of Divine influx. For that love, as it is a conjunction of the understanding and will, is also a conjunction of truth and good, since the understanding receives Divine truth and is formed out of truths, and the will receives Divine good and is formed out of goods.

<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #370 (original Latin)</h4><p>370. Dictum mihi est ab angelis, quod quantum duo conjuges in tali conjunctione sunt, tantum in amore conjugiali sint, et simul tantum in intelligentia, sapientia et felicitate, ex causa quia Divinum Verum ac Divinum Bonum, ex quibus omnis intelligentia, sapientia et felicitas, principaliter influit in amorem conjugialem proinde quod amor conjugialis sit ipsum planum influxus Divini, quia simul est conjugium veri et boni nam sicut est conjunctio intellectus et voluntatis, ita quoque est conjunctio veri et boni, quoniam intellectus recipit Divinum Verum, formatur etiam ex veris, et voluntas recipit Divinum Bonum, et quoque formatur ex bonis quod enim vult homo hoc ei bonum est, et quod intelligit hoc ei verum est; inde est, quod idem sit, si"e dicas conjunctionem intellectus et voluntatis, sive dicas conjunctionem veri et boni. Conjunctio veri et boni facit angelum, et quoque ejus intelligentiam, sapientiam, et felicitatem talis enim est angelus, sicut bonum apud illum conjunctum est vero ac verum bono seu quod idem, talis est angelus sicut apud illum amor conjunctus est fidei, ac fides conjuncta amori. </p>
