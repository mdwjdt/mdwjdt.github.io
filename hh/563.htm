<h3 align="center" class="ired">《天堂与地狱》 第563节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>563、在西边朝南的区域，我看到一些灵人，他们说，在世时他们位高权重有尊严，现在也应该比其他人更受尊敬并统治他人。天使检查了他们的内层特性，发现他们在尘世的职位中只关心自己，不关心功用，这意味着他们将自己摆在功用之前。但是，由于他们急切地渴望，并再三地要求凌驾于他人之上，于是他们被允许加入一个正在讨论重大事务的小组。但人们认识到，他们无法考虑正在讨论的事务、或者从事物本身看问题，关于事物的功用他们什么也说不出，只是由着自己的自我禀性信口开河，目的是迎合自己的欲望。于是，他们被免职，到别处找工作。<br><br>
因此，他们往西走得更远，在各处被接纳，但所到之处都被告知，他们只想着自己，事不关己，无心关注。为此，他们都很愚蠢，就像是肉体感官的灵人。因此，他们无论去哪里，随后都被打发走了。一段时间后，人们看到他们沦落到穷困潦倒的境地，正乞求施舍。<a href="#a547">｛注1｝</a>由此清楚地看到，那些处在自我之爱中的人仅仅出于记忆而不是出于任何理性之光说话，无论他们在世上是如何明智地、好像是从那爱的火焰中说话。在来世，当他们不再被允许检索属世的记忆时，就变得比其他人更愚蠢，因为他们与上帝分离了。<br><br>
<a name="a547">｛注1｝</a>：【英307】相关内容更详细的叙述，请参阅《揭秘<启示录>》（Apocalypse Revealed）第<a href="../ar/153.htm">153</a>节。</p>

<p>563. 我在朝南的西部地区看到一些灵人, 他们说, 他们在世时曾身居要职, 所以应比其他人更受尊敬, 并统治其他人. 天使检查了他们的内层性质, 发现他们在尘世的职位中只关注自己, 不关注功用; 这意味着他们将自己置于功用之前. 他们急切渴望, 并再三要求管理别人, 于是被允许加入那些正在讨论重大事务之人的小组. 但你会发现, 他们并不能思想正在讨论的真正议题, 看问题也没有任何深度, 也不能谈论事物的功用, 只能谈论他们自己的自我形像. 其行为的动机是迎合自己的欲望; 所以他们被免职, 离开到别的地方谋职. 于是他们继续往西走, 时不时被接纳; 但每每被告知, 他们只想着自己, 根本不思想手头的事务, 除非涉及他们自己. 因此, 他们都很愚蠢, 就像纯感官肉体灵. 无论走到哪里, 他们总是被人弃绝. 一段时间后, 只见他们陷入赤贫, 正乞求施舍. 由此清楚看出, 那些陷入自我之爱的人在世时出于这爱之火说起话来无论如何智慧, 都只是凭记忆, 而非任何理性之光来说的. 故在来世, 当他们不再被允许检索属世记忆时, 就变得比其他人还要愚蠢, 因为他们与神性隔绝了. </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>563. 我看到西方偏南的地方有一些靈, 他們說, 在世之時, 他們曾享有尊貴的地位, 故在這裡, 他們也配得享受尊貴的地位, 高人一等。天人審視他們的內在秉性, 結果證明, 在人間的崗位上, 他們並不關心服務, 只關心自己, 將自己置於服務之上。由於他們渴望獲得提拔, 就被允許加入一個社群, 參與討論一些重要的事務。事實證明, 他們並不關心所商議的正事, 看問題也沒有深度, 不能提出建設性的建議, 發言都帶著自我的印記。他們的行為只是為了滿足自己的欲望, 於是被打發離開。他們繼續向西方進發, 不時受到接納, 但每次都被告知, 他們考慮的只是自己, 並不關心事務本身。這表示他們是愚癡的, 和執著於身體與感官的靈沒有兩樣, 乃至無論走到哪裡, 總是被人厭棄。經過一些時日, 他們變得一無所有, 只好乞求施捨。<br><br>由此也能看出, 為我欲之火所激勵的人, 不論其談吐在世人眼前顯得多麼睿智, 卻總歸只是出於呆板的記憶, 不是出於理性之光。所以, 在靈界, 當他們不能從自然的記憶存取訊號時, 就變得極為愚癡, 因為他們已經與上帝切斷了聯繫。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #563 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>563. Some spirits appeared to me in the western region, toward the south, who said they had been granted high honor in the world and deserved to be promoted over others and to lord it over them. They were examined by angels to discover what they were like inwardly, and it turned out that in their earthly offices they had paid no attention to service but only to themselves, which meant that they had put themselves before service. Still, since they were aflame with ambition to be promoted, they were allowed to join a group of people who were discussing some rather important matters. You could tell, though, that they were unable to pay any attention to the real issues that were being discussed and could not see the matters in any depth. They did not say anything on the basis of the constructive effects of the discussion, but talked only on the basis of their own self-image. Their behavior was motivated by a desire to ingratiate themselves; so they were dismissed from the task and left to seek office elsewhere. So they went farther westward, where they were accepted here and there; but in every case they were told that they were not thinking about anything but themselves, that they were not thinking about the business at hand except in terms of themselves. This meant that they were stupid, just like sensual, carnal spirits. Wherever they arrived, then, they were rejected. After a while they were utterly bankrupt and were asking for handouts. <br><br>Once more I could see from this that no matter how wisely people may seem to talk in the world from the fire of self-love, still it is just a matter of rote memory and not of any rational light. So in the other life, when they are no longer allowed to retrieve things from their natural memory, they are more stupid than other people because they are cut off from the Divine. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #563 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p> 563. Certain spirits appeared to me in the western quarter towards the south, saying that they had been in positions of great dignity in the world, and that they deserved to be more highly esteemed than others and to rule over them. Their interior character was explored by angels, and it was found that in their offices in the world they had not looked to uses but to themselves, and thus that they had set themselves before uses. But as they were very eager and importunate to be set over others, they were allowed to associate with those who were consulting about matters of great importance; but it was perceived that they were unable to give any thought to the business under discussion, or to see matters as they are in themselves, or to speak with reference to the use of the thing, but were able to speak only from the proprium, and that they wished to act from what is pleasing on the ground of favour. They were therefore dismissed from that duty, and left to seek employment for themselves elsewhere. Therefore they went further into the western quarter, where they were received here and there, but everywhere were told that they thought only of themselves, and of no business except with reference to self; and for this reason were stupid and merely like sensual corporeal spirits. On this account, wherever they went, they were sent away. Some time afterwards, they were seen reduced to a destitute state and asking alms. Thus it was clear that those who are in the love of self speak merely from the memory, and not from any rational light, no matter how wisely they may seem to speak in the world from the fire of that love. Therefore in the other life, when they are no longer permitted to bring forth the things of the natural memory, they are more stupid than others, and for the reason that they are separated from the Divine. </p><p align="center">------------</p>

<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #563 (original Latin)</h4><p>563. Apparebant aliqui spiritus mihi in occidentali plaga versus meridionalem, qui dicebant se in magna dignitate constitutos fuisse in mundo, et quod mererentur praeferri aliis ac illis imperare. illi explorati ab angelis quales intus essent; et comperti quod in muniis suis in mundo non spectaverint ad usus, sed ad semet, et sic quod se usibus praetulerint; verum quia ambiebant et impense flagitabant praefici aliis, etiam datum est interesse illis qui consultabant de rebus dignioris negotii; sed perceptum est, quod nihil ad negotia, de quibus agebatur, possent attendere, et non videre res intus in se, et quod locuti sint non ex usu rei, sed ex proprio, et quoque quod vellent agere ex beneplacito secundum favorem; quapropter ex functione illa emissi sunt, ac relicti ut alibi sibi munia quaererent. Pergebant itaque ulterius in plagam occidentalem, ubi hic et ibi recepti sunt, sed ubivis illis dictum est, quod non cogitent nisi quam de se, et non de aliqua re nisi ex se; ita quod stupidi essent, et modo sicut sensuales corporei spiritus: quapropter relegati ubicunque venerunt. Post aliquod tempus visi sunt, quod ad incitas redacti sint, et quaererent stipem. Inde quoque patuit, quod qui in amore sui sunt, utcunque ex igne sui amoris sicut sapienter videantur loqui in mundo, usque id sit solum ex memoria et non ex aliqua luce rationali; quare in altera vita, cum res memoriae naturalis non reproduci amplius permittitur, sunt aliis stupidiores, et hoc ex causa, quia separati a Divino. </p>
