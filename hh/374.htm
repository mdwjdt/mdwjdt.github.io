<h3 align="center" class="ired">《天堂与地狱》 第374节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>374、我听到一位天使这样描述真正的婚姻之爱及其属天的快乐：它是主在天堂的神性，也就是神性良善与神性真理在两人中如此亲密地连合，以至于他们不再是二，而是一。他说，在天堂，配偶双方就是婚姻之爱，因为就心智和身体而言，每个人都是他自己拥有的良善和真理，身体是心智的一个形像，因为身体照着它的样式形成的。由此可得出如下的结论：神性显像在处在真正的婚姻之爱中的配偶中。由于神性如此被显像，故天堂也是如此被显像，因为整个天堂就是从主发出的神性良善和神性真理。这就是为什么天堂的一切事物都铭刻在婚姻之爱上，并伴随着数不清的祝福和快乐。天使用数不胜数这个词来表达这个数字。令天使感到惊讶的是，教会的人对此竟然一无所知，教会本是主在地上的天堂，而天堂是良善和真理的婚姻。他说，一想到在教会里，犯奸淫很普遍甚至合理化，这种行径甚至比教会之外还严重，他简直目瞪口呆。就灵义来说，因而在灵界，奸淫的快乐本身无非就是伪谬与邪恶苟合之爱的快乐，这种快乐是地狱的快乐，因为它与天堂的快乐截然对立，而天堂的快乐是真理与良善结合之爱的快乐。</p>

<p>374. 我曾听一位天使以这种方式描述真正的婚姻之爱及其属天的快乐: 它是主在天堂的神性, 也就是说, 神性良善与神性真理在两人里面如此结合, 以致他们不再是二, 而是一. 他说, 在天堂, 配偶双方就是婚姻之爱, 因为无论就心智还是身体而言, 每个人都是他自己的良善和自己的真理. 事实上, 身体是心智的一个形像, 因为它照其样式而形成. 由此可得出以下结论, 神性在处于真正的婚姻之爱的二者里面成像; 由于神性如此成像, 故天堂也是如此成像, 因为整个天堂就是从主发出的神性良善和神性真理. 这就是为何天堂的一切事物被铭刻在婚姻之爱上, 所伴随的祝福和快乐不计其数. 天使以一个涉及无数的词来表达这个数字. 令他感到震惊的是, 教会之人对此竟然一无所知, 教会本是主在地上的天堂, 而天堂是良善与真理的婚姻. 他说, 一想到在教会里, 犯奸淫, 甚至将其合理化的行径甚至比在教会之外还严重, 他简直目瞪口呆; 因为根据灵义, 因而在灵界, 奸淫的快乐本身无非是爱与邪恶苟合的虚假的快乐; 这种快乐是地狱的快乐, 因为它与天堂的快乐截然对立; 而天堂的快乐是爱与良善结合的真理的快乐. </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>374. 我曾聽一位天人如此描述真正的婚愛及其屬天的快樂:它是主在天國的神性, 即聖善與聖理, 在兩人身上結合, 以致兩人不再是二, 而是一。他說在天國, 夫妻就是那愛, 因為每個人皆是他(或她)自己在心靈與身體上的良善與真理。因為身體是心靈的外在形相, 照其樣式而成形。所以, 對於專注於真正婚愛的夫妻, 神性映現在他們身上。神性既映現出來, 天國也就映現出來, 因為整個天國由主所發的聖善和聖理構成。正因如此, 天國的一切皆有婚愛印於其中, 伴隨著無以數計(天人將之描述為千千萬萬)的幸福和快樂。對於教會的信徒對此一無所知, 他感到奇怪, 因為教會本是主在地上的天國, 而天國是良善與真理的結合。一想到教會的信徒竟然行淫, 甚至為之辯護, 比教外人更甚, 天人簡直目瞪口呆。因為從靈義上說(故對心靈世界而言), 行淫的快樂無非是邪惡與偽謬的苟合之樂。這是地獄之樂, 因為它與天國之樂正好相對;天國之樂是真理與良善結合之樂。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #374 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>374. I once heard an angel describe true marriage love and its heavenly pleasures along these lines: It is the Lord's divine nature in the heavens, that is, divine good and divine truth, united in two individuals to the point that they are no longer two but one. The angel said that two spouses in heaven are that love because each is her or his own good and truth in both mind and body. This is because the body is the outward model of the mind, having been formed as its image. It follows that the Divine is imaged in two people who are immersed in true marriage love; and because the Divine is imaged, so is heaven, since the totality of heaven is divine good and divine truth emanating from the Lord. This is why everything heavenly has this love engraved upon it, along with so many blessings and pleasures that they cannot be numbered. Expressing the number with a word that suggested ten thousands times ten thousands, the angel was astonished that church people do not know anything about this when the church is the Lord's heaven on earth and heaven is a marriage of the good and the true; and the angel described being dumbfounded at the thought that adultery was practiced and even rationalized more within the church than outside it, because spiritually understood (and therefore in the spiritual world), the pleasure of adultery is essentially nothing but the pleasure of a love of the union of what is false and what is evil. This is a hellish pleasure, because it is diametrically opposed to the pleasure of heaven, which is the pleasure of a love of what is true united to the good. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #374 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p> 374. I heard an angel describing truly conjugial love and its heavenly delights in this manner: That it is the Lord's Divine in the heavens, which is Divine Good and Divine Truth so united in two persons, that they are not as two but as one. He said that in heaven the two consorts are that love, since everyone is his own good and his own truth both as to mind and body, the body being an image of the mind because it is formed after its likeness. From this he drew the conclusion that the Divine is imaged in a pair who are in truly conjugial love; and as the Divine is so imaged, so is heaven, because the entire heaven is Divine Good and Divine Truth going forth from the Lord; and this is why all things of heaven are inscribed on that love with blessings and delights beyond number. He expressed the number by a term that involved myriads of myriads. He wondered that the man of the Church knows nothing about this, seeing that the Church is the Lord's heaven on the earth, and heaven is a marriage of good and truth. He said he was astounded to think that within the Church, even more than outside it, adulteries are committed and even justified; the delight of which in itself is nothing else in a spiritual sense, and consequently in the spiritual world, than the delight of the love of falsity conjoined to evil, which delight is infernal delight, because it is the direct opposite of the delight of heaven, which is the delight of the love of truth conjoined with good. </p><p align="center">------------</p>

He expressed the number by a term that involved myriads of myriads.

<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #374 (original Latin)</h4><p>374. Audivi angelum describentem amorem vere conjugialem et caelestes ejus jucunditates, tali modo; quod sit Divinum Domini in caelis, quod est Divinum Bonum et Divinum Verum, unitum in duobus, usque ut non duo sint sed ut unum: dicebat, quod duo conjuges in caelo sint ille amor, quia unusquisque est suum bonum et suum verum, tam quoad mentem quam quoad corpus, nam corpus est mentis effigies, quia formatum ad ejus instar. Inducebat inde, quod Divinum sit effigiatum in duobus, qui in amore vere conjugiali sunt et quia Divinum, quod etiam effigiatum sit caelum, quia universum caelum est Divinum Bonum et Divinum Verum procedens a Domino, et quod inde sit quod omnia caeli illi amori inscripta sint, ac tot beatitudines et jucunditates ut excedant numerum. Exprimebat numerum per vocem quae involvit myriades myriadum. Miratus est quod homo ecclesiae nihil de hoc sciat, cum tamen ecclesia est caelum Domini in terris, et caelum est conjugium boni et veri. Dicebat quod obstupescat quum cogitat quod, intra ecclesiam plus quam extra illam, patrentur et quoque confirmentur adulteria, quorum tamen jucundum in se non aliud in spirituali sensu et inde in spirituali mundo est quam jucundum amoris falsi conjuncti malo, quod jucundum est jucundum infernale, quia prorsus oppositum jucundo caeli, quod est jucundum amoris veri conjuncti bono. </p>
