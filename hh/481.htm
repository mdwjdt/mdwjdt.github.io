<h4 align="center"></h4><p>481、第三，拥有属天和属灵之爱的人进入天堂，而拥有属肉体和世俗之爱、没有属天和属灵之爱的人则进入地狱。我所见过的所有被提入天堂和被投入地狱的人，都向我证明了这一点。那些被提入天堂的人的生命源于属天和属灵的爱，而那些被投入地狱的人的生命则源于属肉体和世俗的爱。属天的爱在于因良善、诚实、公正而热爱良善、诚实和公正的事物，并且出于这爱去做这些事。有这种爱的人有善良、诚实、公正的生活，这就是属天的生活。那些热爱良善、诚实和公正是因着它们本身的缘故、并行出或活出它们的人，爱主胜过一切，因为它们出于主；他们也爱邻舍，因为这些事物是应当被爱的邻舍。<a href="#a499">｛注1｝</a>但属肉体的爱就是热爱良善、诚实、公正是为了自私的缘故，而不是为了它们本身的缘故，因为它们被用来获取名利地位。在这种情况下，人在良善、诚实、公正的事上，关注的是自私和世俗，而不是主和邻舍，并以欺诈为乐。源于欺诈和邪恶的“良善、诚实和公正”就是邪恶、不诚实和不公正，这些才是此等人实践“良善、诚实和公正”时心里真正所爱的。<br><br>
[2]由于每个人的生命都是由这些不同种类的爱所决定的，所以一旦人死后进入灵人界，他们就会被检查以发现他们的品性，并与那些处于类似的爱中的人联结。在属天之爱中的人与天堂里的人联结，在属肉体之爱中的则与地狱里的人联结。此外，在经过第一和第二状态之后，这两种人彻底分开，以至于不再看见或认识彼此，因为每个人都变成了他自己的爱，既在属于心智的内心，也在属于脸、身体和言语的外表，每个人都成为自己的爱的形象，甚至在外表上。沉溺于肉体之爱中的人显得粗野、暗淡、黝黑和丑陋；处在属天之爱中的人则显得清新、明亮、白皙和美丽。他们在心智和思想上也完全不同，天堂之爱的人聪明、智慧，而肉体之爱的人则愚昧，可以说很愚蠢。<br><br>
[3]当被允许去观看天堂之爱中的人的思想和情感时，他们的内层看起来像光，有的看似火焰的光，而他们的外层则呈现出彩虹般美丽的色彩。但那些处在肉体之爱中的人的内层则看上去是黑色的，因为它们被关闭了；一些内心充满恶毒欺诈的人，其内层看似一团暗火，而外层则显为肮脏的颜色，不堪入目（在灵界，若主乐意，心智和性情的内层和外层都可以显现出来）。<br><br>
[4]在肉体之爱中的人在天堂之光中什么也看不见，对他们来说，天堂之光就是浓密的黑暗，而像燃煤之光的地狱之光在他们看来则是清明的光。此外，在天堂之光中，他们的内在视觉如此的黑暗，以至于他们变得疯狂。因此，他们躲避这光，藏在兽窝和洞穴之中，或深或浅，其深度和他们里面源于邪恶的伪谬相一致。另一方面，那些在属天之爱中的人，越内在地深入天堂之光，就越清楚地看见万物，万物也越发地向他们显出美丽，他们也更聪明、智慧地感知真理。<br><br>
[5]那些处在肉体之爱中的人根本无法在天堂之热中存活，因为天堂之热就是天堂之爱。但他们能活在地狱之热中，也就是残忍地对待异己的爱中。这种爱的乐趣是对他人的蔑视、敌意、仇恨和报复，当他们在这些乐趣中时，他们就在自己的生活中，不知道出于良善本身和为了良善本身的缘故对他人行善，只知道出于邪恶和为了邪恶的缘故而行善。<br><br>
[6]那些处在肉体之爱中的人在天堂无法呼吸。当任何恶灵被带入天堂时，他就像战斗中的人挣扎着喘气；而那些在属天之爱中的人，越是进入天堂的内部，越是有更自由地呼吸和更丰满的生命。<br><br>
从这些事情可以证实，对人来说，属天和属灵的爱就是天堂，因为天堂的一切事物都被铭刻在这爱上；而脱离属天和灵性之爱的肉体和世俗的爱则是地狱，因为地狱的一切事物都被铭刻在这爱上。由此可见，人的爱是属天和属灵的，他就进入天堂；人的爱是属肉体的和世俗的，远离了属天和属灵的爱，他就进入地狱。<br><br>
<a name="a499">｛注1｝</a>：从最高的意义上说，主就是邻舍，因为爱主高于一切；而爱主就是爱从祂来的，因为祂自己在出自祂的一切的里面，因而就是爱良善和真理（<a href="../ac/2425.htm">2425</a>，<a href="../ac/3419.htm">3419</a>，<a href="../ac/6706.htm">6706</a>，<a href="../ac/6711.htm">6711</a>，<a href="../ac/6819.htm">6819</a>，<a href="../ac/6823.htm">6823</a>，<a href="../ac/8123.htm">8123</a>）。热爱出自主的良善和真理，就是依照良善和真理生活，这就是爱主（<a href="../ac/10143.htm">10143</a>，<a href="../ac/10153.htm">10153</a>，<a href="../ac/10310.htm">10310</a>，<a href="../ac/10336.htm">10336</a>，<a href="../ac/10578.htm">10578</a>，<a href="../ac/10645.htm">10645</a>）。每个人和每个社群，国家和教会，以及普遍意义上主的国度，都是邻舍；出于对良善的爱、依据它们的状态向它们行善，就是爱邻舍。这意味着它们的当受到重视的福祉，就是邻舍（<a href="../ac/6818.htm">6818</a>-<a href="../ac/6824.htm">6824</a>，<a href="../ac/8123.htm">8123</a>）。道德的良善，即诚实，和公民的良善，即公正，也是邻舍。出于对诚实和公正的爱而诚实、公正地行事，就是爱邻舍（<a href="../ac/2915.htm">2915</a>，<a href="../ac/4730.htm">4730</a>，<a href="../ac/8120.htm">8120</a>-<a href="../ac/8123.htm">8123</a>）。因此，对邻舍的仁爱延伸到人生活的各个方面，爱邻舍就是做良善、公正的事，在每个职能和工作中，从心里诚实地行事（<a href="../ac/2417.htm">2417</a>，<a href="../ac/8121.htm">8121</a>，<a href="../ac/8124.htm">8124</a>）。古教会的教义是仁爱的教义，他们从中获得智慧（<a href="../ac/2385.htm">2385</a>，<a href="../ac/2417.htm">2417</a>，<a href="../ac/3419.htm">3419</a>，<a href="../ac/3420.htm">3420</a>，<a href="../ac/4844.htm">4844</a>，<a href="../ac/6628.htm">6628</a>）。</p>

<p>481. ⑶拥有属天和属灵之爱的人进入天堂, 而拥有物质和世俗之爱, 没有属天和属灵之爱的人则进入地狱. 这一点从我所见过的所有被提入天堂和被投入地狱的人向我显明. 被提入天堂之人的生命源于属天和属灵之爱, 而被投入地狱之人的生命则源于物质和世俗之爱. 天堂之爱在于因良善, 诚实, 公正而热爱良善, 诚实, 公正, 并出于这爱而行之. 正因如此, 那些拥有这爱的人便拥有良善, 诚实, 公正的生命, 这就是天堂的生命. 那些热爱良善, 诚实, 公正是为了它们本身的缘故, 并行出或活出它们的人, 则爱主高于一切, 因为它们出自主. 它们也是邻舍, 因为这就是那当爱的邻舍. 但物质的爱就是热爱良善, 诚实, 公正是为自我, 而非它们本身的缘故, 因为它们被用来获取名声, 地位, 利益. 在这种情况下, 人在良善, 诚实, 公正中关注的是自己和世界, 而非主和邻舍, 并以欺诈为乐. 源于欺诈的良善, 诚实, 公正就是邪恶, 不诚实和不公正. 这些就是此等人在实践良善, 诚实, 公正中所爱的.<br><br>由于每个人的生命都取决于这些不同种类的爱, 所以人死后一进入灵人界, 就接受检查以查明他们的品质, 并与那些处于类似的爱之人联结; 人若专注于天堂之爱, 便与天堂里的人联结, 若专注于物质之爱, 则与地狱里的人联结. 此外, 第一和第二个状态结束后, 这两种人就被分开, 以至于不再看见或认识彼此. 事实上, 每个人都变成他自己的爱, 无论在其属于心智的内层方面, 还是在其属于脸, 身体和言语的外层方面. 因为每个人都变成他自己的爱之形像, 甚至在外在事物上也是. 那些成为物质之爱的人显得粗鄙, 黯淡, 黝黑和畸形; 而那些成为天堂之爱的人则显得活泼, 明亮, 白皙和美丽. 他们在心智和思维上也完全不同, 那些成为天堂之爱的人聪明, 智慧, 而那些成为物质之爱的人则迟钝, 可以说很愚蠢.<br><br>当被恩准审视那些处于天堂之爱的人之思维和情感的内层和外层时, 他们的内层看似光, 有的看似火焰之光, 而他们的外层则显为各种美丽的色彩, 就像彩虹. 相比之下, 那些处于物质之爱的人之内层则看似昏暗, 因为它们被关闭了; 一些从内在处于恶毒欺诈之人的内层看似一团暗火, 而他们的外层则显为一种丑陋的色彩, 不堪入目(在灵界, 若主乐意, 心智和灵的内层和外层都显为可见).<br><br>那些处于物质之爱的人在天堂之光中什么也看不见; 对他们来说, 天堂之光就是黑暗; 而如同炭火的地狱之光在他们看来, 则如同白昼. 事实上, 在天堂之光中, 他们的内在视觉如此黑暗, 以致他们变得疯狂. 因此, 他们躲避这光, 藏在兽窝和洞穴之中, 其深度取决于他们里面源于其邪恶的虚假. 另一方面, 那些处于天堂之爱的人越内在地深入天堂之光, 就越清楚地看见所有事物, 所有事物也向他们显得越发美丽, 他们越聪明, 智慧地理解真理.<br><br>再者, 那些处于物质之爱的人根本无法在天堂之热中存活, 因为天堂之热就是天堂之爱. 但他们能活在地狱之热, 也就是对残忍对待不支持他们之人的爱中. 这爱的快乐就是蔑视他人, 敌意, 仇恨和报复, 当这种人吸收这些快乐时, 他们才觉得是真正地活着, 完全不知道什么叫出于良善本身并为了良善本身的缘故向他人行善, 只知道什么叫出于邪恶并为了邪恶的缘故行善.<br><br>那些处于物质之爱的人在天堂无法呼吸. 当有恶灵被带入天堂时, 他就像痛苦挣扎的人那样喘气. 而那些处于天堂之爱的人随着更深入地进入天堂, 却有更自由的呼吸和更丰富的生命. 这一切表明, 对人来说, 属天和属灵之爱就是天堂, 因为天堂的一切事物都被铭刻在这爱上; 而脱离属天和属灵之爱的物质和世俗之爱则是地狱, 因为地狱的一切事物都被铭刻在这爱上. 由此可见, 凡拥有属天和属灵之爱的人, 都进入天堂, 凡拥有物质和世俗之爱, 没有属天和属灵之爱的人, 都进入地狱.<br><br>注: 就至高意义而言, 主就是邻舍, 因为祂被高于一切地爱着; 而爱主就是爱出自祂之物, 因为祂自己在出自祂的一切事物中, 因而爱邻舍就是爱良善与真理(<a href="../ac/2425.htm">天国的奥秘 2425</a>, <a href="../ac/3419.htm">3419</a>, <a href="../ac/6706.htm">6706</a>, <a href="../ac/6711.htm">6711</a>, <a href="../ac/6819.htm">6819</a>, <a href="../ac/6823.htm">6823</a>, <a href="../ac/8123.htm">8123</a>节). 爱出自主的良善与真理就是照良善与真理生活, 这就是爱主(<a href="../ac/10143.htm">天国的奥秘 10143</a>, <a href="../ac/10153.htm">10153</a>, <a href="../ac/10310.htm">10310</a>, <a href="../ac/10336.htm">10336</a>, <a href="../ac/10578.htm">10578</a>, <a href="../ac/10645.htm">10645</a>节). 每个人和每个社群, 国家和教会, 以及广泛意义上主的国度, 都是邻舍; 出于对良善的爱照自己的状态向它们行善, 就是爱邻舍. 这意味着它们当受到重视的福祉就是邻舍(<a href="../ac/6818.htm">天国的奥秘 6818-6824</a>, <a href="../ac/8123.htm">8123</a>节). 道德的良善, 即诚实, 和社会的良善, 即公正, 也是邻舍; 出于对诚实, 公正的爱而行事诚实, 公正就是爱邻舍(<a href="../ac/2915.htm">天国的奥秘 2915</a>, <a href="../ac/4730.htm">4730</a>, <a href="../ac/8120.htm">8120-8123</a>节). 因此, 对邻之仁延伸到人生活的各个方面, 爱邻舍就是行事良善, 公正, 并在一切职业和工作中发自内心诚实行事(<a href="../ac/2417.htm">天国的奥秘 2417</a>, <a href="../ac/8121.htm">8121</a>, <a href="../ac/8124.htm">8124</a>节). 古教会的教义是仁之教义, 这是他们智慧的源头(<a href="../ac/2385.htm">天国的奥秘 2385</a>, <a href="../ac/2417.htm">2417</a>, <a href="../ac/3419.htm">3419</a>, <a href="../ac/3420.htm">3420</a>, <a href="../ac/4844.htm">4844</a>, <a href="../ac/6628.htm">6628</a>节). </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>481. 人之欲若是天國的和心靈的, 就進入天國, 若是肉體的和物質的, 毫無天國的和心靈的成分在內, 就進入地獄;這一結論得自我見過的所有被提入天國和被投入地獄的人。被提入天國的人, 曾過著與天國和心靈之欲相應的生活;被投入地獄的人, 曾過著與肉體和物質之欲相應的生活。天國之欲是因善良, 誠實, 公平本身的緣故而熱愛善良, 誠實, 公平, 並因為熱愛而切實踐行。正因如此, 他們擁有善良, 誠實, 公平的生活, 這是一種天國的生活。人若因善良, 誠實和公平本身的緣故而熱愛之, 實踐之, 就是愛主高於一切, 因為它們皆出於主;也是愛鄰舍如己, 因為它們就是所當愛的"鄰舍"。肉體與物質之欲熱愛善良, 誠實, 公平, 卻不是為它們本身的緣故, 而是為利己的緣故, 因為它們只是用來獲得名利地位的工具。此等人在踐行善良, 誠實, 公平時, 所注重的不是主和鄰舍, 而是自己和物質世界, 並從欺詐中求取快樂。當動機是欺詐時, 一切看似善良, 誠實, 公平的事, 其實都是不善良, 不誠實, 不公平的, 這些才是他心裡真正所愛的。<br><br>正因為人的生命由這些各種不同的欲望所決定, 所以人死後, 一進入靈界, 其秉性就受到審視, 並被安排與有著類似欲望的人聯結起來。活在天國之欲中的, 就被安排與天國的人聯結起來。沉迷於物質之欲, 就被安排與地獄的人聯結起來。當第一個, 第二個狀態結束以後, 兩種類型之人彼此分開, 不再相見, 也不再相識。事實上, 人成為各自之欲, 不僅是在內在思想上, 也是在外在的面貌, 身體, 語言上, 因而成了主導欲的形相, 直至外表。沉迷於物質之欲者顯得粗鄙, 黯淡, 黝黑, 扭曲, 專注于天國之欲者則顯得活潑, 清晰, 光明, 美麗。在靈魂和思想上, 兩者也截然不同。專注于天國之欲者聰明睿智, 沉迷於物質之欲者頑固愚癡。<br><br>專注于天國之欲者, 當他的思想與情感的內與外被允許審視時, 其內看似由光明所構成(有的好像火焰之光), 其外顯出各種美麗的色彩, 猶如彩虹。反之, 沉迷於物質之欲者, 其內看似昏暗(因為是閉合的)。對於內心充滿惡毒詭詐者, 其內看似一團冒著濃煙的火, 其外顯出醜陋之色, 不堪入目。(在靈界, 若蒙主許可, 思想和靈魂的內與外皆可顯為可見。)沉迷於物質之欲者在天國之光中一無所見。對他們來說, 天國之光乃是黑暗, 形如炭火的地獄之光卻反如白晝。事實上, 在天國之光中, 他們的內視失去功能, 因失去光明而變得瘋狂, 故而到處啟避, 藏於洞穴之中。"洞穴"與源自其惡欲的偽謬是相對應的。專注于天國之欲者恰恰相反, 他們越是進入天國之光, 就越發看得分明, 周圍的境界也越發顯得美麗, 對真理的領悟也越發充滿聰明和智慧。<br><br>沉迷於物質之欲者無法忍受天國之熱, 因為天國之熱乃是天國之仁。他們適應於地獄之熱, 地獄之熱乃是遷怒異己的欲望, 此欲之樂在於蔑視, 敵對, 仇恨, 報復。得此快樂, 就是他們所要的生活。至於什麼是出於善並為了善而行善, 他們一無所知, 只知道出於惡並為了惡而行善。<br><br>沉迷於物質之欲者在天國無法呼吸。因此當惡靈被帶入天國時, 其呼吸將變得困難。反之, 專注于天國之欲者越是深入天國, 其呼吸就越自由越有力。<br><br>由此可見, 與人同在的天國, 其實就是天國與心靈之欲, 因為天國的一切都銘記於此欲之上。缺乏天國和心靈之欲的肉體和物質之欲就是地獄, 因為地獄的一切寫在那欲望之上。<br><br>由此我們看出, 擁有天國和心靈之欲者, 進入天國;擁有肉體和物質之欲而缺乏天國和心靈之欲者, 進入地獄。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #481 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>481. We come into heaven if our love is heavenly and spiritual and into hell if our love is carnal and worldly without any heavenly and spiritual dimension. My evidence for this conclusion is all the people I have seen raised into heaven and cast into hell. The ones who were raised into heaven had lives of heavenly and spiritual love, while the ones who were cast into hell had lives of carnal and worldly love. Heavenly love is loving what is good, honest, and fair because it is good, honest, and fair, and doing it because of that love. This is why they have a life of goodness, honesty, and fairness, which is a heavenly life. If we love these things for their own sakes and do or live them, we are also loving the Lord above all because they come from him. We are also loving our neighbor, because these things are our neighbor who is to be loved. <sup>1</sup>Carnal love, though, is loving what is good and honest and fair not for their own sakes but for our own sake, because we can use them to gain prestige, position, and profit. In this case we are not focusing on the Lord and our neighbor within what is good and honest and fair but on ourselves and the world, and we enjoy deceit. When the motive is deceit, then whatever is good and honest and fair is actually evil and dishonest and unfair. This is what we love within [the outward appearance].<p> </p><p>[2] Since these loves define our lives, we are all examined as to our quality immediately after death, when we arrive in the world of spirits, and we are put in touch with people of like love. If we are focused on heavenly love, we are put in touch with people in heaven; and if we are focused on carnal love, we are put in touch with people in hell. Further, once the first and second states have been completed the two kinds of people are separated so that they no longer see or recognize each other. We actually become our own love not only as to the deeper levels of our minds but outwardly as well, in face, body, and speech, since we become images of our love even in outward things. People who are carnal loves look coarse, dim, dark, and misshapen; while people who are heavenly loves look lively, clear, bright, and lovely. They are completely different in spirit and in thought as well. People who are heavenly loves are intelligent and wise, while people who are carnal loves are dense and rather silly.<p> </p><p>[3] When leave is given to examine the inner and outer aspects of the thoughts and affections of people engaged in heavenly love, the inner reaches look as though they were made of light, in some cases like the light of a flame; and their outer manifestations are of various lovely colors, like a rainbow. In contrast, the inner reaches of people who are engaged in carnal love look gloomy because they are closed in, in some cases like a smoky fire for people who were inwardly maliciously deceptive. Their outer manifestations have an ugly color, depressing to look at (both the inner and outer aspects of the mind and spirit are presented visually in the spiritual world whenever it so pleases the Lord).<p> </p><p>[4] People who are engaged in carnal love do not see anything in heaven's light. Heaven's light is darkness to them, while hell's light, which is like the light of glowing embers, is like daylight to them. In fact, in heaven's light their inner sight is deprived of light to the point that they become insane. As a result, they run away from it and hide in caves and caverns of a depth that corresponds to the false convictions that stem from their evil intentions. Exactly the reverse is true for people who are engaged in heavenly love, though. The deeper or higher they enter into heavenly light, the more clearly they see everything and the lovelier it all looks, and the more intelligently and wisely they grasp what is true.<p> </p><p>[5] There is no way that people who are engaged in carnal love can live in heaven's warmth, because heaven's warmth is heavenly love. They can live in hell's warmth, though, which is a love of cruelty toward people who do not support them. The pleasures of this love are contempt for others, hostility, hatred, and vengefulness. When they are absorbed in these they are in their very life, with no knowledge whatever of what it means to do good for others out of sheer goodness and for the sake of the good itself. All they know is how to do good out of malice and for the sake of malice.<p> </p><p>[6] People who are engaged in carnal love cannot breathe in heaven either. When evil spirits are taken there, they draw breath like someone who is struggling painfully. On the other hand, people who are engaged in heavenly love breathe more freely and feel more alive the deeper into heaven they come. <br><br>We may gather from this that a heavenly and spiritual love is heaven for us because everything heavenly is written on that love; and that carnal and worldly love apart from heavenly and spiritual love is hell for us because everything hellish is written on that love. <br><br>We can see, then, that people come into heaven who have a heavenly and spiritual love, and people come into hell who have a carnal and worldly love without a heavenly and spiritual one. <br><br><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br><div><p>1.&nbsp;In the highest sense, the Lord is our neighbor because he is to be loved above all; however, loving the Lord is loving what comes from him because he is in everything that comes from him, so [our neighbor is] whatever is good and true: <a href="../ac/2425.htm">Arcana Coelestia 2425</a>, <a href="../ac/3419.htm">3419</a>, <a href="../ac/6706.htm">6706</a>, <a href="../ac/6711.htm">6711</a>, <a href="../ac/6819.htm">6819</a>, <a href="../ac/6823.htm">6823</a>, <a href="../ac/8123.htm">8123</a>.

Every individual and community, our country and church, and in the broadest sense the Lord's kingdom, is our neighbor; and loving our neighbor is helping them from a love for their good in keeping with their state.

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #481 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p>481. The man whose love is heavenly and spiritual comes into heaven; while the man whose love is corporeal and worldly with no heavenly and spiritual love goes to hell. This has been confirmed for me from all whom I have seen taken up into heaven or cast into hell. The life of those taken up into heaven had been derived from a heavenly and spiritual love, while the life of those cast into hell had been derived from a corporeal and worldly love. Heavenly love consists in loving what is good, honest, and just, because it is good, honest and just, and in doing this from that love; and those who have this love have a life of goodness, honesty, and justice, which is the heavenly life. Those who love these things for their own sake, and who do them or live them, love the Lord above all things, because they are from Him; they also love the neighbour, because these things are the neighbour who is to be loved. <sup>1</sup>But corporeal love is loving what is good, honest, and just, not for its own sake but for the sake of self, because reputation, honour, and gain can thus be acquired. Such, in what is good, honest, and just, do not look to the Lord and to the neighbour, but to self and the world, and feel delight in fraud; and the goodness, honesty and justice derived from fraud are evil, dishonesty, and injustice, and these are what are loved by such in their practice of goodness, honesty, and justice. <p> </p><p>[2] As the life of everyone is determined by these different kinds of love, as soon as men after death enter the world of spirits they are examined to discover their quality, and are joined to those who are in a like love; those in heavenly love to those who are in heaven, and those in corporeal love to those who are in hell. Also after they have passed through the first and second state they are so separated as to see or know each other no longer; for each one becomes his own love, both in respect of his interiors pertaining to his mind, and in respect of his exteriors pertaining to his face, body, and speech; for each becomes an image of his own love, even in externals. Those who are corporeal loves appear gross, dusky, black and misshapen; while those who are heavenly loves appear fresh, bright, fair and beautiful. Also in their minds and thoughts they are wholly unlike, those who are heavenly loves being intelligent and wise, while those who are corporeal loves are stupid and, as it were, foolish. <p> </p><p>[3] When it is granted to behold the interiors and exteriors of thought and affection of those who are in heavenly love, their interiors appear like light, and some like a flamy light, while their exteriors appear in various beautiful colours like rainbows. But the interiors of those who are in corporeal love appear as if black, because they are closed up; and the interiors of some who were interiorly in malignant deceit appear like a dusky fire. But their exteriors appear of a dirty colour, and disagreeable to the sight. (The interiors and exteriors of the mind and "animus" are made visible in the spiritual world whenever the Lord pleases.) <p> </p><p>[4] Those who are in corporeal love see nothing in the light of heaven; to them the light of heaven is thick darkness; but the light of hell, which is like light from burning coals, is to them as clear light. Moreover, in the light of heaven their interior sight is so darkened that they become insane; consequently, they shun that light and hide themselves in dens and caverns, more or less at a depth in accordance with the falsities with them derived from their evils. On the other hand, those who are in heavenly love, the more interiorly and deeply they come into the light of heaven, see all things more clearly and all things appear more beautiful to them, and they perceive truths more intelligently and wisely. <p> </p><p>[5] It is impossible for those who are in corporeal love to live at all in the heat of heaven, for the heat of heaven is heavenly love; but they can live in the heat of hell, which is the love of raging against others who do not favour them. The delights of that love are contempt of others, enmity, hatred and revenge; and when they are in these delights they are in their life, and have no idea what it is to do good to others from good itself and for the sake of good itself, knowing only what it is to do good from evil and for the sake of evil. <br><br> </p><p>[6] Those who are in corporeal love are unable to breathe in heaven. When any evil spirit is brought into heaven he draws his breath like one struggling in combat; while those who are in heavenly love have a freer respiration and a fuller life the more interiorly they are in heaven. From these things it can be confirmed that heaven with man is heavenly and spiritual love, because on that love all things of heaven are inscribed; also that corporeal love and worldly love apart from heavenly and spiritual love, are hell with man, because on such loves all things of hell are inscribed. From these things it is clear that he whose love is heavenly and spiritual comes into heaven, and he whose love is corporeal and worldly apart from heavenly and spiritual love comes into hell. <br><br><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br><div><p>1.&nbsp;In the highest sense, the Lord is the neighbour, because He is to be loved above all things; but loving the Lord is loving what is from Him, because He Himself is in everything that is from Him, thus it is loving what is good and true (<a href="../ac/2425.htm">Arcana Coelestia 2425</a>, <a href="../ac/3419.htm">3419</a>, <a href="../ac/6706.htm">6706</a>, <a href="../ac/6711.htm">6711</a>, <a href="../ac/6819.htm">6819</a>, <a href="../ac/6823.htm">6823</a>, <a href="../ac/8123.htm">8123</a>). <br><br>Loving what is good and true which is from the Lord is living in accordance with good and truth, and this is loving the Lord (<a href="../ac/10143.htm">Arcana Coelestia 10143</a>, <a href="../ac/10153.htm">10153</a>, <a href="../ac/10310.htm">10310</a>, <a href="../ac/10336.htm">10336</a>, <a href="../ac/10578.htm">10578</a>, <a href="../ac/10645.htm">10645</a>). <br><br>Every man and every society, also one's country and the Church, and in a universal sense the Lord's kingdom, are the neighbour, and doing good to these from a love of good in accord with their state is loving the neighbour; that is, their good that should be consulted is the neighbour (<a href="../ac/6818.htm">Arcana Coelestia 6818-6824</a>, <a href="../ac/8123.htm">8123</a>). <br><br>Moral good also, which is honesty, and civil good, which is justice, are the neighbour; and to act honestly and justly from the love of honesty and justice is loving the neighbour (<a href="../ac/2915.htm">Arcana Coelestia 2915</a>, <a href="../ac/4730.htm">4730</a>, <a href="../ac/8120.htm">8120-8123</a>). <br><br>Thus charity towards the neighbour extends to all things of the life of man, and loving the neighbour is doing what is good and just, and acting honestly from the heart, in every function and in every work (<a href="../ac/2417.htm">Arcana Coelestia 2417</a>, <a href="../ac/8121.htm">8121</a>, <a href="../ac/8124.htm">8124</a>). <br><br>The doctrine in the Ancient Church was the doctrine of charity, and from that they had wisdom (<a href="../ac/2385.htm">Arcana Coelestia 2385</a>, <a href="../ac/2417.htm">2417</a>, <a href="../ac/3419.htm">3419-3420</a>, <a href="../ac/4844.htm">4844</a>, <a href="../ac/6628.htm">6628</a>). </p></div><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #481 (Ager, 1900)</h4><p>481. (iii) The man who has heavenly and spiritual love goes to heaven; while the man who has corporeal and worldly love and no heavenly and spiritual love goes to hell. This has been made evident to me from all whom I have seen taken up into heaven or cast into hell. The life of those taken up into heaven had been derived from a heavenly and spiritual love, while the life of those cast into hell had been derived from a corporeal and worldly love. Heavenly love consists in loving what is good, honest, and just, because it is good, honest and just, and in doing this from love; and those that have this love have a life of goodness, honesty, and justice, which is the heavenly life. Those that love what is good, honest, and just, for its own sake, and who do this or live it, love the Lord above all things, because this is from Him; they also love the neighbor, because this is the neighbor who is to be loved. <sup>1</a></sup>But corporeal love is loving what is good, honest, and just, not for its own sake but for the sake of self, because reputation, honor, and gain can thus be acquired. Such, in what is good, honest, and just, do not look to the Lord and to the neighbor, but to self and the world, and find delight in fraud; and the goodness, honesty and justice that spring forth from fraud are evil, dishonesty, and injustice, and these are what are loved by such in their practice of goodness, honesty, and justice.<br><br>[2] As the life of everyone is determined by these different kinds of love, as soon as men after death enter the world of spirits they are examined to discover their quality, and are joined to those that are in a like love; those that are in heavenly love to those that are in heaven, and those that are in corporeal love to those that are in hell; and after they have passed through the first and second state they are so separated as to no longer see or know each other; for each one becomes his own love, both in respect to his interiors pertaining to his mind, and in respect to his exteriors pertaining to his face, body, and speech; for everyone becomes an image of his own love, even in externals. Those that are corporeal loves appear gross, dusky, black and misshapen; while those that are heavenly loves appear fresh, bright, fair and beautiful. Also in their minds and thoughts they are wholly unlike, those that are heavenly loves being intelligent and wise, while those that are corporeal loves are stupid and as it were silly.<br><br>[3] When it is granted to behold the interiors and exteriors of thought and affection of those that are in heavenly love, their interiors appear like light, and some like a flamy light, while their exteriors appear in various beautiful colors like rainbows. But the interiors of those that are in corporeal love appear as if black, because they are closed up; and the interiors of some who were interiorly in malignant deceit appear like a dusky fire. But their exteriors appear of a dirty color, and disagreeable to the sight. (The interiors and exteriors of the mind and disposition are made visible in the spiritual world whenever the Lord pleases.)<br><br>[4] Those that are in corporeal love see nothing in the light of heaven; to them the light of heaven is thick darkness; but the light of hell, which is like light from burning coals, is to them as clear light. Moreover, in the light of heaven their inward sight is so darkened that they become insane; consequently they shun that light and hide themselves in dens and caverns, more or less deeply in accordance with the falsities in them derived from their evils.

When any evil spirit is brought into heaven he draws his breath like one struggling in a contest; while those that are in heavenly love have a freer respiration and a fuller life the more interiorly they are in heaven. All this shows that heaven with man is heavenly and spiritual love, because on that love all things of heaven are inscribed; also that hell in man is corporeal and worldly love apart from heavenly and spiritual love, because on such loves all things of hell are inscribed.

<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #481 (original Latin)</h4><p>481. [(iii.)] Quod homo in caelum veniat, cui amor coelestis et spiritualis est; ac in infernum cui amor corporeus et mundanus absque caelesti et spirituali, constare mihi potuit ex omnibus quos vidi in caelum sublatos, et in infernum conjectos. illis, qui in caelum sublati sunt, vita fuerat ex amore caelesti ac spirituali illis autem, qui in infernum conjecti sunt, vita fuerat ex amore corporeo et mundano. Amor caelestis est amare bonum, sincerum, et justum, quia est bonum, sincerum, et justum, et ex illo amore facere illa inde illis vita boni, sinceri et justi, quae est vita caelestis. Qui illa amant propter illa, ac faciunt illa seu vivunt illa, etiam amant Dominum supra omnia, quia ab Ipso sunt; et quoque amant proximum, quia illa sunt proximus qui amandus. <sup>1</sup>Amor autem corporeus est amare bonum, sincerum et justum non propter illa, sed propter semet, quia per illa aucupant famam, honores et lucra illi in bono, sincero et justo non spectant Dominum et proximum, sed se et mundum, ac jucundum in fraude sentiunt; ac bonum, sincerum, ac justum ex fraude, est malum, insincerum et injustum, quae in illis amant.<br><br> <br>[2] Quia amores ita determinant vitam cujusvis, ideo omnes, ut primum post mortem in mundum spirituum veniunt, explorantur quales sunt, et alligantur illis qui in simili amore sunt; qui in amore caelesti, illis qui in caelo, et qui in amore corporeo illis qui in inferno. Et quoque post exactum statum primum et secundum, separantur ita ut non se amplius videant, nec se cognoscant fit enim unusquisque suus amor, non modo quoad interiora quae mentis sunt, sed etiam quoad exteriora quae faciei, corporis; et loquelae sunt nam quisque fit sui amoris effigies, etiam in externis. Qui amores corporei sunt, illi apparent crassi, obscuri, nigri, et deformes qui autem amores caelestes sunt, apparent vegeti, lucidi, candidi, et pulchri: sunt etiam prorsus dissimiles animis et cogitatiotionibus qui amores caelestes sunt, etiam sunt intelligentes et sapientes; qui autem amores corporei sunt, stupidi et quasi fatui sunt.<br><br> <br>[3] Cum datur inspicere interiora et exteriora cogitationis et affectionis illorum qui in amore caelesti sunt, apparent interiora instar lucis, quorundam instar lucis flammeae et exteriora in vario colore pulchro sicut irides: at interiora illorum qui in amore corporeo sunt, apparent sicut nigrum, quia clausa sunt, et quorundam sicut obscurum igneum, qui sunt qui in dolo maligno interius fuerunt exteriora autem apparent in colore tetro, et ad aspectum tristi. (Interiora et exteriora quae mentis et animi sunt, in mundo spirituali sistuntur videnda, quoties Domino beneplacet.)<br><br> <br>[4] Qui in amore corporeo sunt, nihil vident in luce caeli: lux caeli illis est caligo; at lux inferni, quae est sicut lux ex ignitis carbonibus, est illis sicut clara lux; in luce caeli etiam obtenebratur visus eorum interior, usque ut insaniant, quapropter fugiunt illam, et recondunt se in antris et cavernis, profunde secundum falsa ex malis apud eos vicissim autem illi, qui in amore caelesti sunt, quo interius seu superius in lucem caeli veniunt, eo clarius omnia vident, et quoque pulchriora omnia, ac eo intelligentius et sapientius percipiunt vera.<br><br> <br>[5] Qui in amore corporeo sunt, nequaquam vivere possunt in calore caeli, nam calor caeli est caelestis amor, sed in calore inferni, qui est amor saeviendi in alios qui sibi non favent. Contemptus aliorum, inimicitiae, odia, vindictae, sunt illius amoris jucunda; in quibus cum sunt, in sua vita sunt; prorsus non scientes quid sit bonum facere aliis ex ipso bono, et propter ipsum bonum, sed modo bonum ex malo et propter malum.<br><br> <br>[6] Qui in amore corporeo sunt, nec respirare possunt in caelo: cum aliquis malus spiritus illuc fertur, trahit animam sicut qui laborat in agone; qui autem in caelesti amore sunt, eo liberius respirant, et plenius vivunt, quo interius in caelo. Ex his constare potest, quod amor caelestis et spiritualis sit caelum apud hominem, quia illi amori omnia caeli inscripta sunt; et quod amor corporeus et [amor] mundanus absque caelesti et spirituali sint infernum apud hominem, quia illis amoribus omnia inferni inscripta sunt. Ex his patet, quod in caelum veniat, cui amor caelestis et spiritualis est, ac in infernum cui amor corporeus et mundanus absque caelesti et spirituali est.<br><br> <br><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br><div class="footnote-section"><br>1.&nbsp;Quod Dominus in supremo sensu sit Proximus, quia Ille super omnia amandus est;
