<h3 align="center" class="ired">《天堂与地狱》 第487节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>487、人死后，其属世的快乐会转变成不同种类和性质的属灵的快乐，要了解这些，唯有通过对应的知识。总的来说，这种知识告诉我们，若没有相对应的属灵事物，属世事物就无法存在。尤其是，它教导所对应的事物的本质和性质。因此，任何有这种知识的人，只要他知道自己的爱是什么，以及它与上面所说的普遍的主导爱有什么样的关系（所有的爱都与这主导爱有关系），他就能查明并知道自己死后的状态。然而，那些在自我之爱中的人不可能知道他们的主导爱是什么，因为他们爱自己的一切，并称他们的邪恶为良善，将他们的趋向邪恶、确认邪恶的伪谬称为真理。然而，如果他们愿意的话，他们可能会从其他有智慧的人那里知道自己的主导爱，因为智者看到了他们自己看不到的东西。但对那些深受自我之爱诱惑、摒弃智者的一切教导的人来说，这是不可能的。<br><br>
[2]另一方面，那些在天堂之爱中的人却接受教导，一旦他们被带到与生俱来的邪恶中，他们就会凭真理中看清它们，因为真理会使邪恶显现出来。凭借源于良善的真理，任何人都能看清邪恶及其伪谬；但凭借邪恶，没有人能看清何为良善和真理，因为邪恶的伪谬是黑暗，并对应于黑暗。因此，那些在源于邪恶的伪谬中的人就像瞎子，看不见光明中的事物，而是像猫头鹰一样躲避它们。<a href="#a502">｛注1｝</a>但源于良善的真理是光，并对应于光明（参看<a href="../hh/126.htm">126</a>-<a href="../hh/134.htm">134</a>节），所以那些在来自良善的真理中的人拥有视觉和睁开的双眼，并能分辨属于光明和阴暗的事物。<br><br>
[3]经历也向我证实了这一点。天堂里的天使既能看见也能感知到自己里面有时出现的邪恶和伪谬、以及灵人界中与地狱相连的灵人里面的邪恶和伪谬，尽管这些灵人无法看见自身的邪恶和伪谬。这些灵人不理解天堂之爱的良善、良心的良善、诚实和公正的良善，除非是为了自我的缘故而去行的。他们也不理解何为被主引导。他们说，这些东西不存在，因而无关紧要。我说这一切是为了使人能检查自己，能通过自己的快乐认识自己的爱，这样就能根据所把握的对应的知识，可以知道自己死后的生命状态。<a href="#a503">｛注2｝</a><br><br>
<a name="a502">｛注1｝</a>：根据对应，圣经中的“黑暗”表示伪谬，“幽暗”表示邪恶的伪谬（<a href="../ac/1839.htm">1839</a>，<a href="../ac/1860.htm">1860</a>，<a href="../ac/7688.htm">7688</a>，<a href="../ac/7711.htm">7711</a>）。在恶人看来，天堂之光就是浓密的黑暗（<a href="../ac/1861.htm">1861</a>，<a href="../ac/6832.htm">6832</a>，<a href="../ac/8197.htm">8197</a>）。在地狱的人被说成是在黑暗中，因为他们在邪恶的伪谬中；其中一些（<a href="../ac/3340.htm">3340</a>，<a href="../ac/4418.htm">4418</a>，<a href="../ac/4531.htm">4531</a>）。在圣经中，“瞎子或瞎眼的”表示那些在伪谬中而不愿受教的人（<a href="../ac/2383.htm">2383</a>，<a href="../ac/6990.htm">6990</a>）。<br><br>
<a name="a507">｛注2｝</a>：【英277】瑞典伯格鼓励自我反省，将其作为通向救赎的灵性成长的必不可少的第一步，也是他所谓的“真正的悔改”的一部分。参见《属天的奥秘》（<a href="../ac/1608.htm">1608</a>:2和<a href="../ac/7178.htm">7178</a>节）；尤其是《真实的基督教》（<a href="../tcr/535.htm">535</a>、<a href="../tcr/461.htm">461</a>和<a href="../tcr/563.htm">563</a>节）。</p>
<p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>487. 要知道死后每个人的属世快乐所转化的属灵快乐的种类和品质, 唯有通过对应的知识. 总的来说, 这种知识教导, 属世事物若离开与其相对应的属灵事物, 就无法存在. 具体来说, 它教导凡如此对应之物的本体和性质. 这意味着凡拥有这种知识的人都能查明并洞悉自己死后的状态, 只要他知道自己的爱是什么, 以及它与刚才所说的普遍主导爱有什么样的关系, 因为一切爱都可追溯到这主导爱. 然而, 那些陷入自我之爱的人不可能知道他们的主导爱是什么, 因为他们爱自己的一切, 并称自己的邪恶为良善; 称他们所倾向并用来确认其邪恶的虚假为真理. 不过, 他们若愿意, 就能从智慧人那里得知自己的主导爱, 因为智慧人能看到他们自己看不到的东西. 然而, 对那些受自我之爱诱惑, 以至于鄙弃智者的一切教导之人来说, 这是不可能的.<br><br>另一方面, 那些处于天堂之爱的人却接受教导, 一被带入他们与生俱来的邪恶, 他们就凭真理看清它们, 因为真理使邪恶显现. 凭源于良善的真理, 谁都能看清邪恶及其虚假; 但凭邪恶, 没有人能看清何为良善与真理. 因为邪恶的虚假是黑暗, 并对应于黑暗. 所以, 那些陷入源于邪恶的虚假之人就像瞎子, 看不见光明中的事物, 而是避开它们, 就像夜鸟. 但源于良善的真理是光明, 并对应于光明(参看<a href="126.htm">126-134</a>节), 所以那些处于源于良善的真理之人拥有视觉和睁开的双眼, 并能分辨属于光明和阴暗的事物.<br><br>这一点也通过经历向我证明了. 天堂里的天使既能看见也能察觉到自己里面不时产生的邪恶与虚假, 以及灵人界中与地狱相联的灵人里面的邪恶与虚假, 尽管这些灵人本身无法看见自己的邪恶与虚假. 若非为了自己的缘故, 这类灵人根本不明白天堂之爱的良善, 良心, 诚实和公正; 也不明白什么叫被主引导. 他们说, 这些东西不存在, 因而无足轻重. 我说这一切, 是为了叫人检查自己, 通过自己的快乐认识自己的爱, 因而尽可能凭对应的知识将它辨别出来, 从而知道自己死后的生命状态.<br><br>注: 根据对应关系, 在圣言中, “黑暗”表示虚假, “幽暗或漆黑”表示邪恶的虚假(<a href="../ac/1839.htm">天国的奥秘 1839</a>, <a href="../ac/1860.htm">1860</a>, <a href="../ac/7688.htm">7688</a>, <a href="../ac/7711.htm">7711</a>节). 在恶人看来, 天堂之光就是黑暗(<a href="../ac/1861.htm">天国的奥秘 1861</a>, <a href="../ac/6832.htm">6832</a>, <a href="../ac/8197.htm">8197</a>节). 之所以说那些身处地狱的人陷入黑暗, 是因为他们陷入源于邪恶的虚假; 一些讨论(<a href="../ac/3340.htm">天国的奥秘 3340</a>, <a href="../ac/4418.htm">4418</a>, <a href="../ac/4531.htm">4531</a>节). 在圣言中, “瞎子或瞎眼的”表示那些陷入虚假, 不肯受教的人(<a href="../ac/2383.htm">天国的奥秘 2383</a>, <a href="../ac/6990.htm">6990</a>节). </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>487. 要瞭解人死後其物質之樂將如何轉化為心靈之樂, 唯一的途徑是通過對應的學問。籠統而言, 對應學指出凡物質之物皆有心靈之物相對應;具體而言, 它指明各對應的細節和性質。這意味著熟悉對應知識的人可洞悉他死後的狀態, 只要他瞭解自己的欲望以及他的欲望與主導欲的關係。<br><br>不過, 陷於我欲的人無法瞭解自己的主導欲, 因為他愛自身的一切, 視自己的惡為善, 自己的謬為理, 因為他們用謬見來將自己的惡欲合理化。但不管怎樣, 只要他們願意, 還是可以從智者認清自己的主導欲, 因為智者能看透他們所不能看透的。唯有為惡欲所引誘, 鄙視智者訓誨的人, 終究不能認識自己。<br><br>反之, 擁有天國之仁的人願意接受指教, 被惡欲引誘時, 他們也能洞察自己的稟性之惡。他們能以理來審視自己的欲望和行為, 因為理能將惡顯明出來。事實上, 任何人皆可通過善之理看清惡與謬。但是, 沒有人能透過邪惡的視角洞明善與理。因為邪惡所生的偽謬乃是黑暗, 或者說對應於黑暗。所以, 陷入邪惡所生之偽謬的人好比白天一無所見的盲人, 或如啟避光明的夜鷹。反之, 善所生的正見乃是光, 或與光對應。所以, 擁有善所生之正見的人目光如炬, 能分辨光明與陰暗的事物。<br><br>這也是我通過親身經歷所確證的事實。天國的天人既能照見也能察覺不時從自身所湧出的惡欲和謬見, 也能看透與地獄聯結之靈正處於怎樣的惡欲和謬見, 靈本身卻不能照見。他們不知天國之仁, 良心, 誠實, 公平有何美善(除非于己有利), 也不知被主引導是何含義。他們說這些都不存在, 故而沒有價啟。<br><br>我說這一切, 是要勉勵人們省察自身, 從快樂的角度認識自己的主導欲, 以便通過瞭解對應而洞悉自己死後的狀態。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #487 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>487. The only way to know the kinds and qualities of the spiritual pleasures into which natural pleasures turn after death is through a knowledge of correspondences. This teaches in general that there is nothing natural to which something spiritual does not answer, and it teaches specifically the identity and nature of whatever does so correspond. This means that people who are engaged in this knowledge can recognize and know their state after death provided they know their love and how it relates in its nature to the universally dominant love to which, as we have just stated, all loves go back. <br><br>However, people who are involved in self-love cannot know what their dominant love is because they love whatever is theirs and call their evils good. They also call false things true, the false notions that support them and that they use to rationalize their evils. If they were willing, though, they could still know [their dominant love] from other people who are wise, because these latter see what they themselves do not. This does not happen, though, in the case of people who are so enmeshed in their self-love that they have nothing but contempt for any teaching of the wise.<p> </p><p>[2] On the other hand, people who are in heavenly love do accept instruction and do see the evils into which they were born when they are led into them. They see them from truths because truths make evils obvious. Anyone can in fact see what is evil and the distortion it causes by seeing from the truth that arises from what is good; but no one can see what is good and true from an evil standpoint. This is because the false notions that arise from evil are darkness and correspond to it. So people who are caught up in false notions that arise from evil are like blind people who do not see things that are in the light, and they avoid them the way owls avoid daylight. <sup>1</sup>On the other hand, the true perceptions that arise from good are light and correspond to light (see above, <a href="126.htm">126-134</a>). So people who are focused on the true perceptions that arise from good are sighted and open-eyed and can differentiate between things that are in light and shade.<p> </p><p>[3] I have been granted confirmation of this too by experience. The angels who are in the heavens both see and grasp the evil and false promptings that well up in them from time to time; and they can also see the evil and false promptings that engage the spirits in the world of spirits who are in touch with the hells, though the spirits themselves cannot see their own evil and false promptings. They do not grasp what the virtue of heavenly love is, what conscience is, what is honest and fair (except as it is to their own advantage), or what it means to be led by the Lord. They say these things do not exist and therefore make no difference whatever. <br><br>All this has been presented to encourage people to examine themselves and to identify their dominant love on the basis of their pleasures, so that according to their grasp of the knowledge of correspondences, they may know their state of life after death. <br><br><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br><div><p>1.&nbsp;By reason of correspondence, darkness in the Word means falsities, and dense darkness or gloom means falsities that stem from evil: <a href="../ac/1839.htm">Arcana Coelestia 1839</a>, <a href="../ac/1860.htm">1860</a>, <a href="../ac/7688.htm">7688</a>, <a href="../ac/7711.htm">7711</a>.

People who are in the hells are said to be in darkness because they are engrossed in false notions that stem from evil; with some discussion: <a href="../ac/3340.htm">3340</a>, <a href="../ac/4418.htm">4418</a>, <a href="../ac/4531.htm">4531</a>.

<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #487 (original Latin)</h4><p>487. Quaenam et qualia sunt jucunda spiritualia, in quae vertuntur jucunda naturalia cujusvis post mortem, non aliunde sciri potest quam ex scientia correspondentiarum. Haec docet in genere, quod non aliquid naturale detur, cui non spirituale correspondet, et quoque docet in specie quodnam et quale id quod correspondet. Quapropter qui in illa scientia est, cognoscere potest ac scire statum suum post mortem, modo sciat suum amorem, et qualis ille est in amore universaliter regnante, ad quem omnes amores se referunt, ut mox supra dictum est. Sed amorem suum regnantem scire, impossibile est illis qui in amore sui sunt; quia amant sua, et mala sua vocant bona, ac simul falsa, quae favent, et per quae confirmant sua mala, vocant vera; at usque, si volunt, ex aliis, qui sapientes sunt, possunt scire, quoniam illi vident quae non ipsi.
