<h3 align="center" class="ired">《天堂与地狱》 第326节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>326、当非基督徒进入来世时，如果他们以一种图像或雕像、偶像的形式敬拜某个神，就会被介绍给特定的灵人以代替那些神祇或偶像，为了让他们摆脱幻想，这是很常见的事情。相处一些天后，他们的幻想就被抛弃了。也有人敬拜某个特定的人，有时就被带到他们所敬拜的那个人、或其他替代者面前。例如，许多犹太人被带到亚伯拉罕、雅各、摩西或大卫面前，当发现这些人和其他人一样，只是凡人，并不能给他们帮助时，他们感到羞愧，然后被带到与他们的生命相一致的、属于他们自己的地方。在天堂的非基督徒当中，非洲人最受厚爱，因为他们比其他人更容易接受天堂的良善和真理。他们特别希望被称为“顺服的”，而不是“忠信的”。他们说，基督徒拥有信之教义，可称作“忠信的”，但前题是接受该教义——或者，如非洲人所说的，有能力去接受这教义。<a href="#a404">｛注1｝</a><br><br>

<p>326. 经常发生的情形是, 当非基督徒进入来世时, 他们若以一种图像或雕像, 偶像的形式敬拜某个神, 就会被带到扮演他们的神或偶像的人面前, 好帮助他们摆脱幻想. 他们与这些人相处一些时日后, 这种幻想就被打消. 他们若敬拜某个人, 有时就被带到他们所敬拜的那个人, 或扮演他的人面前. 例如, 许多犹太人被带到亚伯拉罕, 雅各, 摩西或大卫面前; 当发现这些人和其他人一样, 只是凡人, 并不能给他们帮助时, 他们感到羞愧, 然后被带到与他们的生命相一致的地方. 在天堂里的非基督徒当中, 非洲人最可爱, 尤其被珍视, 因为他们比其他人更容易接受天堂的良善与真理. 他们特别希望被称为“顺从”, 而非“忠信”. 他们说, 基督徒拥有信之教义, 可称作“忠信”; 但他们必须接受该教义, 或如非洲人所说的, 能够接受该教义才行. </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>326. 通常, 非基督徒生前若敬拜神像(或雕像, 偶像), 以之為神明, 當他進入靈界以後, 將被帶到扮演其所拜之神明的人面前, 好說明他們擺脫錯誤的觀念。與之相處數日以後, 就被帶走。<br><br>他們若崇拜某個特定的人, 就被帶到他或扮演他的人面前。比如, 很多猶太人被帶到亞伯拉罕, 雅各, 摩西或大衛的面前, 等其發現他們也只是凡人, 並不能給予特別的恩典時, 他們感到十分窘迫, 然後被帶到與其生命一致的地方。<br><br>在天國的非基督徒當中, 屬非洲人最為可愛, 因為他們最樂於接受天國的良善與真理。他們特別喜歡被稱為"順服的,"而非"虔信的"。他們說基督徒可稱為"虔信的,"因為他們有一套關於信的教義, 不過他們必須接受該教義, 或如非洲人所說, 能接受該教義才行。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #326 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>326. It often happens that when non-Christians come into the other life, if they have worshiped some god in the form of an image or statue or idol, they are introduced to people who take on the roles of those gods or idols in order to help rid them of their illusions. After they have been with these people for a few days, they are taken away. <br><br>If they have worshiped particular individuals, then they are introduced either to those people themselves or to individuals who play their parts. Many Jews, for example, are introduced to Abraham, Jacob, Moses, or David; but when they realize that they are just as human as anyone else and that they have nothing special to offer them, they are embarrassed, and are taken off to whatever place is in keeping with their lives. <br><br>Of non-Christians, the Africans are especially valued in heaven. They accept the good and true things of heaven more readily than others do. They want especially to be called obedient, but not faithful. They say that Christians could be called "faithful," since they have a doctrine of faith, but only if they accept the doctrine - or, as the Africans say, if they can accept it. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #326 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p> 326. It is a common thing for gentiles who have worshipped any god under an image or statue, or any graven thing, to be introduced, when they come into the other life, to certain spirits in place of their gods or idols, in order that they may rid themselves of their fantasies. When they have been with these for some days, the fantasies are put away. Also those who have worshipped men are sometimes introduced to the men they have worshipped, or to others in their place-as many of the Jews to Abraham, Jacob, Moses, and David-but when they come to see that they are human the same as others, and that they can give them no help, they become ashamed, and are carried to their own places in accordance with their lives. Among the gentiles in heaven the Africans are most beloved, for they receive the goods and truths of heaven more readily than others. They especially wish to be called obedient, but not faithful. They say that Christians because they possess the doctrine of faith may be called faithful, but not they, unless they accept that doctrine, or, as they say, have the ability to accept it. </p><p align="center">------------</p>

<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #326 (original Latin)</h4><p>326. Commune est, quod Gentiles, qui adorarunt aliquem deum sub imagine aut statua, vel aliquod sculptile, dum in alteram vitam veniunt, introducantur ad quosdam, qui loco eorum deorum seu idolorum sunt, ex causa ut phantasias suas exuant; apud quos cum per aliquot dies fuerunt, inde auferuntur. Qui adorarunt homines, etiam quandoque ad eos, vel ad alios qui loco eorum, introducuntur; sicut plures ex Judaeis ad Abrahamum, Jacobum, Mosen, Davidem; sed cum appercipiunt quod tale humanum iis sit sicut aliis, et quod nihil opis ferre possint, pudefiunt; et ad sua loca secundum vitam feruntur Inter Gentes in caelo maxime diliguntur Africani; hi enim facilius reliquis recipiunt bona et vera caeli: volunt imprimis dici obedientes, non vero fideles. Dicunt, quod Christiani, quia fidei doctrinam habent, possint fideles nominari; ii vero [non] nisi illam recipiant, aut, ut dicunt, recipere possint. </p>
