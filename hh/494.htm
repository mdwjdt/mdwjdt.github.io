<h3 align="center" class="ired">《天堂与地狱》 第494节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>494、由于人的灵魂紧随其世上的生命是这样的状态，<a href="#a509">｛注1｝</a>此时，他在世时的朋友和认识的人都能认出他。因为灵人们不仅凭该人的面容和言语认出他，还在靠近他时通过他的生命气场来认出他。在来世，每当有人想到某人时，他就在脑海中回想这个人的脸，连同这个人生活的许多事，当他这样做时，对方就会出现，仿佛是被送来或召唤来的。在灵界之所以是这样的，是因为在那里思想都是共享的，也没有像尘世这样的空间（参看<a href="../hh/191.htm">191</a>-<a href="../hh/199.htm">199</a>节）。所以，所有人一进入来世，都被他们的亲朋好友和他所认识的人认出来。他们互相交谈，然后照他们在世上的友谊交往。我经常听说，那些从尘世来的人，为又见到自己的朋友们而喜出望外，而他们的朋友也为他们的到来感到高兴。<br><br>
夫妻重逢、欣喜相迎的情形非常普遍，他们继续在一起，时间的长短取决于他们在世上共同生活中的快乐。最终，除非他们被真正的婚姻之爱（出于属天之爱而彼此心智相结合）结合在一起，否则在一起一段时间后就会分开。如果他们的心智早已不和，内心互相排斥，就会爆发出公开的敌意，甚至互相厮打。尽管如此，他们在进入第二个状态前（稍后将要描述），仍不会分开。<br><br>
<a name="a509">｛注1｝</a>：【中】人生命的本质在于人的“灵”（spirit）而不是身体，在强调与身体同在时，习惯称为“灵魂”；当灵魂离开身体进入到灵界时，就称为“灵人”。</p>
<p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>494. 由于人在世上的生命结束后, 其随即到来的灵之状态是这样, <br><br>所以这时他在世时所认识的人都能认出他. 事实上, 灵人不仅凭人的脸和言语, 还凭他靠近时的生命气场认出他. 在来世, 每当有人想到另一人时, 他就在脑海中回想起这个人的脸, 连同其生活的许多细节; 当他如此行时, 对方就会出现, 仿佛被打发或召唤来. 像这样的事之所以发生在灵界, 是因为在那里, 思维都共享, 并且没有诸如自然界中的那种空间(参看<a href="191.htm">191-199</a>节). 所以, 一进入来世, 所有人都被他们的亲朋好友和无论以哪种方式所认识的人认出. 他们互相交谈, 然后继续照世上的友谊来往. 我经常听说, 那些从尘世来的人因又见到自己的朋友而喜出望外, 他们的朋友也为他们的到来感到高兴. 夫妻重逢欢喜互祝的情形非常普遍, 他们继续在一起, 时间的长短取决于他们在世上共同生活的快乐程度. 但是, 他们若没有被一种真正的婚姻之爱联结起来(这是一种出于天堂之爱的心智联结), 在一起一段时间后就会分开. 如果他们的心智早已不和, 互相排斥, 他们就会爆发为公开的敌意, 有时甚至互相攻击. 尽管如此, 他们在进入稍后所描述的第二个状态之前, 仍不会分开. </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>494. 既然人死後首先是進入這樣的狀態, 那麼他就能被死去的朋友和熟人認出來, 既可以通過面貌和聲音, 也可通過靠近時對方所發出的生命氣場。在靈界, 當我們想起任何人, 他的音容笑貌就出現在腦海, 同時還有他的生活情節。此時, 我們所想念的人就真的出現於眼前, 好像被差派過來或者把他叫過來。會發生這事, 是在於靈界中人們的思想是共通的, 這裡沒有物質世界那樣的空間。所以, 一進入靈界, 朋友眷屬就會立刻認出我們。我們互相交談, 繼續保持人間的交往。故友重逢歡喜交加的場面, 我見過很多。<br><br>夫妻重逢歡喜交加的情景也時常發生。他們繼續共同生活, 時間的長短取決於二人在人間快樂融洽的程度。最後, 除非他們是以真正的婚姻之愛, 就是因天國之仁而在思想上結合, 否則一段時間以後, 二人必要分離。<br><br>思想不合, 彼此厭惡的夫妻, 會將敵對情緒公然表現出來, 甚至互相掐架。但是, 在進入第二個狀態之前, 他們一般不會分開。關於第二個狀態, 我很快會加以描述。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #494 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>494. Since this is what we are like as spirits immediately after our life in the world, our friends and people we had known in the world then recognize us. Spirits perceive who we are not only from our faces and voices but also from the aura of our life when they come near. In the other life, whenever we think about someone, we call up that individual's face in our thought along with many details about her or his life; and when we do this, the other is called to us. Things like this happen in the spiritual world because thoughts are shared there and because space is not what it is in the natural world (see above, <a href="191.htm">191-199</a>). This is why as soon as we arrive in the other life, we are all recognized by our friends and relatives and by people we have known in one way or another. Further, we talk with each other and continue to see each other in keeping with our friendship in the world. I have heard many people who had just come from the world overjoyed to see their friends again, and their friends overjoyed that they had arrived. <br><br>It often happens that married partners meet and welcome each other joyfully. They stay together as well, but for a longer or shorter time depending on how happily they had lived together in the world. Ultimately, unless they had been united by real marriage love (which is a union of minds from heavenly love), they separate after having been together for a while. <br><br>If the minds of the partners disagreed, however, and if they were inwardly repellent to each other, they break out into open hostility and sometimes actually fight with each other. Still, they are not separated until they enter the second state, which will be described shortly. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #494 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p> 494. The state of man's spirit that immediately follows his life in the world being such, he is then recognized by his friends and by those he had known in the world; for this is something that spirits perceive not only from one's face and speech but also from the sphere of his life when they draw near. Whenever anyone in the other life thinks about another he brings his face before him in thought, and at the same time many things of his life; and when he does this the other becomes present, as if he had been sent for or called. This is so in the spiritual world because thoughts there are shared, and there is no such space there as in the natural world (see above, <a href="191.htm">191-199</a>). So all, as soon as they come into the other life, are recognized by their friends, their relatives, and those in any way known to them; and they talk with one another, and afterwards associate in accordance with their friendships in the world. I have often heard that those who have come from the world were rejoiced at seeing their friends again, and that their friends in turn were rejoiced that they had come. Very commonly husband and wife come together and congratulate each other, and continue together, and this for a longer or shorter time according to their delight in living together in the world. But if they had not been united by a truly conjugial love, which is a conjunction of minds by heavenly love, after remaining together for a while they separate. Or if their minds had been discordant and were inwardly adverse, they break forth into open enmity, and sometimes into combat; nevertheless they are not separated until they enter the second state, which will be treated of presently. </p><p align="center">------------</p>

<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #494 (original Latin)</h4><p>494. Quia spiritus hominis recens post vitam in mundo talis est, ideo tunc cognoscitur ab amicis, et ab illis quos in mundo notos habuit, id enim spiritus percipiunt non modo a facie et, loquela ejus, sed etiam a sphaera vitae ejus cum approximant. Unusquisque in altera vita, dum cogitat de altero, etiam sistit sibi ejus faciem in cogitatione, et simul plura quae ejus vitae sunt; et cum hoc facit, alter fit praesens sicut adscitus et vocatus. Tale existit in mundo spirituali ex eo, quod communicentur ibi cogitationes, et quod ibi spatia non sint qualia in mundo naturali (videatur supra, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_494/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_191" target=_top>191-199</a>). Inde est, quod omnes, dum primum in alteram vitam veniunt, agnoscantur a suis amicis, cognatis, et aliquo modo notis, et quoque quod loquantur inter se, ac dein consociantur secundum amicitias in mundo. Audivi pluries, quod illi, qui venerunt e mundo, gavisi sint, quod suos amicos iterum videant, et amici vicissim quod ad illos venerint. Hoc commune est, quod conjux conjugem conveniat, et congratulentur se mutuo; commorantur etiam una, sed diutius et brevius secundum cohabitationis jucundum in mundo; at usque, si non amor vere conjugialis eos conjunxerit, qui amor est conjunctio mentium ex amore caelesti, post aliquantam commorationem separantur. Si autem mentes conjugum dissederant <sup>1</sup>inter se, ac se interius aversatae fuerunt, erumpunt in apertas inimicitias, et quandoque inter se dimicant; et tamen usque non separantur, priusquam alterum statum, de quo in mox sequentibus, ineunt.<br><br> <br><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br><div class="footnote-section"><br>1.&nbsp;dissederant pro "dissiderant" </p>
