<h4 align="center"></h4><p>279、每一个正在重生的人也是这样。重生就是再生为属灵之人。人首先被引入童年的天真中，这包括从主而不是从自己认识真理、践行良善；因真理和良善本身的缘故而渴慕、寻求真理和良善。随着人年龄的增长，主便将良善和真理赐予他。一开始，他被引入良善和真理的知识中，然后从知识进入聪明，最后从聪明进入智慧，并且始终伴随着天真，如前所述，这包括凭自己不知道任何真理，也不能行任何良善，唯独靠主。没有这个信仰和感知，就没有人能接受天堂的任何事物。智慧的天真主要在于此。</p>

<p>279. 每一个正在重生的人差不多都是这样. 就属灵人而言, 重生就是再一次出生. 当人重生时, 他首先被引入孩童时的纯真, 也就是认识到人凭自己不知道任何真理, 也没有能力行出任何良善, 唯有靠主; 渴望并寻求真理与良善, 只是因为它是真理与良善. 后来, 随着人年龄增长, 主便将良善与真理赐予他. 一开始, 他被引入良善与真理的知识, 然后从知识进入聪明, 最后从聪明进入智慧, 并且始终伴随着纯真; 如前所述, 纯真就在于他凭自己不知道任何真理, 也没有能力行出任何良善, 唯有靠主. 没有这种信仰和觉知, 没有人能接受天堂的任何事物. 而天堂事<br><br>物是智慧纯真的主要成分. </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>279. 重生中的人, 情況與之相似。重生是人心靈的再生。重生中的<br><br>人首先被帶入孩子的天真, 承認自己在真理上的無知和在善行上的無能, 覺悟真理和良善都出於主, 並因真理和良善本身的緣故而熱愛之, 尋求之。隨著年歲的增長, 主將這些賜予我們。我們首先獲得相關的知識, 然後從知識進入聰明, 最後從聰明進入智慧, 在此過程中, 始終有天真攜手相隨。所謂"天真,"正如前面所說, 就是承認自己在真理上的無知和在善行上的無能, 覺悟真理和良善都出於主。無此信念和覺悟, 人無從承受天國。智慧的天真, 根本在此。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #279 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>279. It is much the same for everyone who is being regenerated. Regeneration is rebirth as a spiritual person. [When we are being regenerated,] we are brought first into the innocence of infancy, which is realizing that we know nothing of truth and are capable of nothing of good on our own, but only from the Lord, and that we long for and seek what is true and good simply because it is true and good. These gifts are granted by the Lord as we advance in age. We are led first into knowledge about them, then from knowledge into intelligence, and finally from intelligence into wisdom, always hand in hand with innocence, which is, as already noted, the recognition that we know nothing of truth and are capable of nothing of good on our own, but only from the Lord. No one can accept heaven without this belief and this perception. It is the prime component of the innocence of wisdom. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #279 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p>279. The same is true of every one who is being regenerated. Regeneration, as regards the spiritual man, is re-birth. Man is first introduced into the innocence of childhood, which consists in knowing what is true and doing what is good from the Lord only and not from himself, and in desiring and seeking truth only because it is truth, and good only because it is good. As man advances in age, good and truth are given him by the Lord. At first he is led into a knowledge of them, then from knowledge into intelligence, and finally from intelligence into wisdom, always accompanied by innocence which consists, as has been said, in his not being able to know anything of truth, or do anything of good from himself but only from the Lord. Without this faith and a perception of it no one can receive anything of heaven. Therein does the innocence of wisdom chiefly consist. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #279 (Ager, 1900)</h4><p>279. The same is true of everyone who is being regenerated. Regeneration, as regards the spiritual man, is re-birth. Man is first introduced into the innocence of childhood, which is that one knows no truth and can do no good from himself, but only from the Lord, and desires and seeks truth only because it is truth, and good only because it is good. As man afterwards advances in age good and truth are given him by the Lord. At first he is led into a knowledge of them, then from knowledge into intelligence, and finally from intelligence into wisdom, innocence always accompanying, which consists, as has been said, in his knowing nothing of truth, and being unable to do anything good from himself but only from the Lord. Without such a belief and such a perception of it no one can receive any thing of heaven. Therein does the innocence of wisdom chiefly consist. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #279 (original Latin)</h4><p>279. Similiter fit cum omni qui regeneratur. Regeneratio est renascentia quoad spiritualem hominem is primum introducitur in innocentiam infantiae, quae est quod nihil veri sciat et boni possit ex se, sed solum ex Domino, et quod desideret et appetat illa ex causa solum quia est verum et quia est bonum; dantur etiam illa a Domino, sicut progreditur aetate; ducitur ille primum in scientiam illorum, dein a scientia in intelligentiam, et demum ab intelligentia in sapientiam, semper comitante innocentia, quae est, ut dictum est, quod nihil veri sciat et nihil boni possit ex se sed ex Domino: absque hac fide et ejus perceptione nemo aliquid caeli recipere potest in eo praecipue consistit innocentia sapientiae. </p>
