<h4 align="center"></h4><p>436、我蒙允许从大量的亲身经历中得知，就人的内层来说，人是一个灵。如果我把这些经历都写出来，套用一句俗话，它们必是长篇累牍。我曾作为一个灵与灵人交谈，也曾作为一个在身体里的人与他们交谈。当我作为一个灵与他们交谈时，他们只知道我本人是一个灵人，有着和他们一样的人形。我的内层就这样出现在他们面前，因为当我作为一个灵人与他们交谈时，没有看见我的物质身体。</p>

<p>436. 我蒙允许从大量经历获知, 就其内层而言, 人是一个灵. 如果我真把这些经历都描述出来, 用一句俗话说, 它们必是长篇累牍. 我曾作为一个灵与灵人交谈, 也曾作为一个在肉体里的人与他们交谈. 当我作为一个灵与他们交谈时, 他们只知道我本人是一个灵人, 处在和他们一样的人形中. 我的内层便以这种方式在他们面前显现, 因为当我作为一个灵与他们交谈时, 他们看不见我的肉体. </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>436. 大量的親身經歷讓我明白, 就內在而言, 人是個靈。我若將所有經歷述說出來, 必能寫成一本大部頭的著作。作為一個靈, 我與其它靈交談;作為一個在肉身中的人, 也與他們交談。作為靈與他們交談時, 同樣視我為與他們一樣的某個靈, 有著和他們一樣的人形。在他們眼中, 我的內在就是這樣的形像, 因為我作為靈與他們交談時, 他們看不見我的肉身。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #436 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>436. A great deal of experience has taught me that we are spirits inwardly, experience that would fill whole volumes, as they say, if I were to include it all. I have talked with spirits as a spirit and I have talked with them as a person in a body. When I have talked with them as a spirit, they could not tell that I was not a spirit myself, in just as human a form as theirs. That is how my inner nature looked to them, because when I talked with them as a spirit, they could not see my material body. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #436 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p>436. That in respect of his interiors man is a spirit, it has been granted to me to know from much experience, which, to employ a common saying, would fill volumes if I were to describe it all. I have talked with spirits as a spirit, and I have talked with them as a man in the body; and when I talked with them as a spirit they did not know otherwise than that I myself was a spirit and in a human form as they were. Thus did my interiors appear before them, for when I talked with them as a spirit my material body was not seen. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #436 (Ager, 1900)</h4><p>436. That in respect to his interiors man is a spirit I have been permitted to learn from much experience, which, to employ a common saying, would fill volumes if I were to describe it all. I have talked with spirits as a spirit, and I have talked with them as a man in the body; and when I talked with them as a spirit they knew no otherwise than that I myself was a spirit and in a human form as they were. Thus did my interiors appear before them, for when talking with them as a spirit my material body was not seen. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #436 (original Latin)</h4><p>436. Quod homo sit spiritus quoad interiora sua, datum est mihi scire per multam experientiam, quam omnem si adducerem, impleret, <sup>1</sup>sicut dicitur, membranas. Locutus sum cum spiritibus ut spiritus, et locutus sum cum illis ut homo in corpore et cum locutus sum cum illis ut spiritus, non sciverunt aliter quam quod ipse spiritus essem, et quoque in humana forma sicut illi; ita apparuerunt interiora mea coram illis, quoniam cum locutus sum ut spiritus, materiale meum corpus non apparuit.<br><br> <br><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br><div class="footnote-section"><br>1.&nbsp;impleret pro "implerent" </p>
