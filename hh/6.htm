<h3 align="center" class="ired">《天堂与地狱》 第6节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>6、有些灵人<a href="#a35">｛注1｝</a>活在世上时，声称自己承认父，却只认为主是常人，因而他们不相信祂是天堂的上帝。为此，他们被允许到处漫游，可以随意询问有没有一个不属于主的天堂。他们寻访一些日子，一无所获。他们就是那些将天堂的幸福置于荣耀和权柄之中的人。他们得不到自己想要的，并且被告知，天堂里没有这样的事。他们就变得愤愤不平，并希望有一个天堂，在那里他们可以凌驾于他人之上，如同在世上一样显贵。<br><br>
<a name="a35">｛注1｝</a>：【中】“灵人”（spirit）还可以译为“灵魂”、“灵”，这里指在灵界的人（灵魂）。人死后，灵魂离开肉体，在灵界存在，处于此状态的灵魂，本书译为“灵人”；这也表示这些灵魂此时还不在天堂，因为瑞典伯格的著作中，凡在天堂的，称为“天使”。极有可能仍在天堂与地狱之间的中间灵界（可参阅下文第<a href="../hh/421.htm">421</a>节），这是人死后最先到的地方。人活着时，是有灵的活人，有灵魂和肉体，通常简称“灵与肉”，此时“灵”也表示“灵魂”，但由于灵魂一词歧义较多，本书多译为“灵”。</p>
<p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>6. 有些灵人活在世上时, 承认父, 却认为主和其他任何人一样, 因而不相信祂是天堂的神. 于是, 他们被允许四处游荡, 随意寻访, 看看除了主的天堂外, 是否还有任何其它天堂. 他们寻访数日, 无果而终. 这些灵人就在诸如将天堂的幸福置于荣耀和权柄的人之列; 他们因得不到自己想要的, 并被告知, 天堂并不在于这类事物, 故愤愤不平, 想要拥有一个他们能在那里统治他人, 如世上那样以荣耀为显赫的天堂. </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>6. 有些靈(人死後, 離開物質世界, 進入心靈世界, 稱為"靈"。)儘管已經承認父, 但他們對主的概念只限於:像其他人那樣, 祂是個人。這意味著他們不相信主是天國的上帝。由此緣故,<br><br>他們被允許周遊四方, 隨意尋訪, 看能否找到一個不屬於主的天國。他們尋訪多日, 無果而終。<br><br>此等人將幸福建立於榮譽和控制別人之上;由於不能如願, 且被告知這些欲望與天國無份, 他們就憤憤不平。希望有一個可以讓他們淩駕於別人之上的天國, 在此享受如同在世上那樣的榮華富貴。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #6 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>6. There were some spirits who had acknowledged the Father but whose only concept of the Lord had been that he was a human being like everyone else. This meant they did not believe that he was the God of heaven. As a result, they were allowed to travel here and there and to ask at will whether there was a heaven that did not belong to the Lord. They asked around for some days without finding any. <br><br>They were people who placed happiness in glory and in being in control, and since they could not get what they craved and were told that such feelings were not part of heaven, they felt insulted. They wanted a heaven where they could lord it over others and excel in the kind of glory they had had in this world. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #6 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p>6. There were certain spirits who, while they lived in the world, acknowledged the Father, without having any other idea of the Lord than as of another man, and who therefore did not believe that He was the God of heaven. For this reason they were permitted to wander about and enquire wherever they wished whether there were any other heaven than the Lord's heaven. They searched for several days but nowhere found any. These spirits were amongst such as placed the happiness of heaven in glory and in domination, and because they could not get possession of what they desired and were told that heaven does not consist of such things, they were indignant and wished to have a heaven where they could lord it over others and be eminent in a glory like that in the world. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #6 (Ager, 1900)</h4><p>6. There were certain spirits who while living in the world had professed to believe in the Father; but of the Lord they had the same idea as of any other man, and therefore did not believe Him to be the God of heaven. For this reason they were permitted to wander about and inquire wherever they wished whether there were any other heaven than the heaven of the Lord. They searched for several days, but nowhere found any. These were such as place the happiness of heaven in glory and dominion; and as they were unable to get what they desired, and were told that heaven does not consist in such things, they became indignant, and wished for a heaven where they could lord it over others and be eminent in glory like that in the world. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #6 (original Latin)</h4><p>6. Fuerunt quidam spiritus, qui, dum in mundo vixerunt, professi sunt Patrem, et de Domino non aliam ideam, quam sicut de alio homine habuerunt, et inde non crediderunt Ipsum esse Deum caeli; quapropter illis permittebatur circumvagari, et inquirere ubicunque vellent, num aliud caelum sit quam Domini; inquisiverunt etiam per aliquot dies, et nullibi invenerunt. Erant illi inter tales, qui felicitatem caeli ponebant in gloria ac in dominatu; et quia non potiri potuerunt quae cupiverunt, et dictum illis quod caelum non consistat in talibus, indignati sunt, et voluerunt caelum habere in quo possent dominari supra alios, et eminere gloria quali in mundo. </p>
