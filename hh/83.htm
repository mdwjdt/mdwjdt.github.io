<h4 align="center"></h4><p>83、因为这个原因，凡对天堂没有概念，也就是说，对创造天堂的神性没有概念的人，无法被提升至天堂的第一道门槛。一旦这样的人接近天堂，就感知到阻力和强烈的排斥。这是因为，他那原本应该接受天堂的内在因着没有处在天堂的形态，已经被关闭了。离天堂越近，关得越紧。这就是教会中否认主的人的命运，以及像苏西尼派（Socinians）那样否认主的神性的人的命运。至于那些出生于教会外的人，因没有圣经而不知道主，他们的结局容后再叙。<a href="#a135">｛注1｝</a><br><br>

<p>83. 因此缘故, 凡对天堂没有概念, 也就是对天堂所来自的神性没有概念的人, 无法被提升至天堂的第一道门槛. 他一接近天堂, 就感受到一种抵制和强烈的排斥. 这是因为, 他那原本接受天堂的内层已经因它们没有处在天堂的形式中而被关闭了; 他越接近天堂, 他的内层就关得越紧. 这就是教会中那些否认主的人, 以及那些如苏西尼派那样否认主的神性之人的命运. 至于那些出生于教会之外, 因没有圣言而不知道主之人的命运, 容后再述. </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>83. 因為這個緣故, 對創造天國的上帝缺乏正確觀念的人, 連跨入天國的門檻也不能。他們剛接近天國, 就感到一種明顯的排斥和強烈的抗拒。因為與天國的形態不合, 原本為接收天國而造的內在層次已經關閉。事實上, 他們越靠近天國, 內在層次就閉合得越緊。教會之中那些否認主或否認主的神性之人(如索齊尼派), 結局乃是如此。至於教外不承認主或不瞭解聖言的人, 他們的結局容後再敘。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #83 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>83. This is why people who do not share in heaven's concept (that is, in the concept of the Divine Being who makes heaven) cannot be raised even to the first threshold of heaven. The moment any such individuals arrive, they feel a perceptible opposition and forceful resistance. This is because the deeper levels of such people, levels that are intended to accept heaven, are actually closed because they are not in heaven's form. In fact, the nearer such people come to heaven, the more tightly their deeper levels are closed. <br><br>This is the lot of people within the church who deny the Lord and who, like the Socinians, deny his divinity. The lot of people who have been born outside the church and who have not acknowledged him or possessed the Word will be seen below. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #83 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p>83. For this reason, he who has no idea of heaven, that is, no idea of the Divine from Whom heaven exists, cannot be raised to the first threshold of heaven. As soon as he comes to it, a resistance and a strong repulsion is perceived. This is because in his case the interiors which should have been receptive of heaven, have been closed on account of their not being in the form of heaven. Indeed, the nearer he comes to heaven, the more tightly are his interiors closed up. Such is the lot of those within the Church who deny the Lord, and of those who, like the Socinians, deny His Divinity. The lot of those, however, who have been born outside the Church and who are ignorant of the Lord because they do not have the Word, will be seen in the pages that follow. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #83 (Ager, 1900)</h4><p>83. For this reason he that has no conception of heaven, that is, no conception of the Divine from which heaven is, cannot be raised up to the first threshold of heaven. As soon as such a one draws near to heaven a resistance and a strong repulsion are perceived; and for the reason that his interiors, which should be receptive of heaven, are closed up from their not being in the form of heaven, and the nearer he comes to heaven the more tightly are they closed up. Such is the lot of those within the church who deny the Lord, and of those who, like the Socinians, deny His Divinity. But the lot of those who are born out of the church, and who are ignorant of the Lord because they do not have the Word, will be described hereafter. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #83 (original Latin)</h4><p>83. Inde est, quod qui non in idea caeli est, hoc est, in idea Divini ex quo caelum, non possit ad primum limen caeli elevari; ut primum illuc venit, percipitur resistentia et fortis renisus: causa est, quia interiora apud illum, quae receptura essent caelum, clausa sunt, quoniam non in forma caeli immo illa, quo propius venit ad caelum, eo arctius clauduntur. Talis sors est illis intra ecclesiam, qui Dominum negant, et qui ut Sociniani Divinum Ipsius: qualis autem sors est illis qui extra ecclesiam nati sunt, quibus Dominus non est notus quia Verbum non habent, videbitur in sequentibus. </p>
