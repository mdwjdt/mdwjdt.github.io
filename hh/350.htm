<h4 align="center"></h4><p>350、凡为真理和良善的缘故而热爱真理和良善的人，都被接入天堂。因此，那些爱多的人被称为智慧人，而那些爱少的人被称为简单人。在天堂，智慧人在强光中，简单人在弱光中，取决于各自热爱良善和真理的程度。为了真理和良善的缘故而热爱真理和良善就是意愿并践行它们。因为意愿并践行的人就是那热爱的人，而不意愿并践行的人则是那不爱的人。前者就是爱主并为主所爱的人，因为良善和真理都来自主。由于良善和真理都来自主，所以主在良善和真理里面，因而也在这些人里面：他们通过意愿和实践，将良善和真理接入到他们的生活中。此外，当人在自己里面查看时，无非就是他自己的良善和真理，因为是其意志的本质，真理是其理智的本质，意志和理智的品质决定了这个人的品质。由此可见，在何等的程度上人的意志从良善形成、理智从真理形成，人就在何等的程度上为主所爱。为主所爱也就是爱主，因为爱是相互的。主将爱的能力赐予那被爱者。</p>

<p>350. 凡为真理与良善的缘故而热爱真理与良善者, 都被接入天堂. 因此, 那些爱多的人被称为智慧人, 而那些爱少的人被称为简单人. 在天堂, 智慧人住在大量的光中, 简单人住在少量的光中, 各自都取决于其热爱良善与真理的程度. 为了真理与良善的缘故而热爱真理与良善就是意愿并行出它们; 因为意愿并行出的人就是那爱的人, 而不意愿并行出的人则是那不爱的人. 前者就是爱主并为主所爱的人, 因为良善与真理皆来自主. 由于良善与真理皆来自主, 所以主在良善与真理里面, 因而也在那些通过意愿并行出而将良善与真理融入其生活的人里面. 此外, 当在自己里面被观之时, 人无非是他自己的良善与真理, 因为良善是其意愿的实质, 真理是其理解力的实质, 其意愿与理解力的品质就决定了这个人的品质. 由此可见, 人只在其意愿从良善形成, 其理解力从真理形成方面为主所爱. 为主所爱也是爱主, 因为爱是相互的. 主将爱的能力赐予那被爱者. </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>350. 凡為真理與良善本身而熱愛真理與良善的人, 皆為天國所接<br><br>收。其中啟啟程度更甚者被稱為智者, 程度弱的被稱為愚者。在天國, 智者住于強光中, 愚者住於弱光中, 皆根據其熱愛良善與真理的程度。<br><br>所謂為真理與良善本身而熱愛真理與良善, 乃是立志並奉行之, 因為立志並奉行者才是仁者, 知而不行非仁者。前者愛主, 也為主所愛, 因為良善與真理皆出於主。既出於主, 主便在兩者之中(即在良善與真理之中)。所以, 凡通過立志並奉行而將良善與真<br><br>理用於生活者, 皆有主與之同在。究其實, 人無非是各自的良善與真理, 因為良善關乎意志, 真理關乎認知, 良善與真理的特質決定了我們作為人的特質。由此可見, 人的意志和認知若分別由良善與真理構成, 也就為主所愛。為主所愛也是對主的愛, 因為愛是相互的。主使被愛者也有能力去愛。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #350 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>350. Everyone is accepted into heaven who has loved what is true and good for the sake of what is true and good. People who have loved a great deal are the ones who are called "wise," and people who have loved less are the ones who are called "simple." The wise ones in heaven are in abundant light, while the simple in heaven are in less light, all according to their level of love of what is good and true. <br><br>To love what is true and good for the sake of what is true and good is to intend and to do them, for the people who intend and act are the ones who love, not the ones who do not intend and act. The former are the ones who love the Lord and are loved by the Lord, because what is good and what is true are from the Lord; and since they are from the Lord, the Lord is within them (within what is good and what is true, that is); so he is also with people who accept what is good and what is true into their lives by intending and doing them. <br><br>Seen in our own right, we are nothing but our good and our truth, because the good is the substance of our volition and the true is the substance of our understanding, and the quality of our volition and understanding determines our own quality as persons. We can see from this that we are loved by the Lord to the extent that our volition is formed from what is good and our understanding is formed from what is true. <br><br>To be loved by the Lord is to love the Lord as well, because love is reciprocal. The Lord enables the beloved to love. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #350 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p> 350. All are received into heaven who have loved truth and good for the sake of truth and good; therefore those who have loved much are called the wise, and those who have loved little are called the simple. The wise in heaven are in much light, the simple in less light, everyone in accordance with the degree of his love for good and truth. To love truth and good for the sake of truth and good is to will and do them; for those love who will and do, while those who do not love do not will and do. Such also love the Lord and are loved by the Lord, because good and truth are from the Lord. And because good and truth are from the Lord, the Lord is in good and truth; and hence He is in those who receive good and truth into their life by willing and doing. Moreover, when man is viewed in himself he is nothing but his own good and truth, because good is of his will and truth of his understanding, and man is such as his will and understanding are. It is evident from this that man is loved by the Lord just to the extent that his will has been formed from good and his understanding from truth. To be loved by the Lord is also to love the Lord, since love is reciprocal; for upon him who is loved the Lord bestows ability to love. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #350 (Ager, 1900)</h4><p>350. All are received into heaven who have loved truth and good for the sake of truth and good; therefore those that have loved much are called the wise, and those that have loved little are called the simple. The wise in heaven are in much light, the simple in less light, everyone in accordance with the degree of his love for good and truth. To love truth and good for the sake of truth and good is to will and do them; for those love who will and do, while those who do not will and do do not love. Such also love the Lord and are loved by the Lord, because good and truth are from the Lord. And inasmuch as good and truth are from the Lord the Lord is in good and truth; and He is in those who receive good and truth in their life by willing and doing. Moreover, when man is viewed in himself he is nothing but his own good and truth, because good is of his will and truth of his understanding, and man is such as his will and understanding are. Evidently, then, man is loved by the Lord just to the extent that his will is formed from good and his understanding from truth.

<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #350 (original Latin)</h4><p>350. Omnes in caelum recipiuntur, qui amaverunt verum et bonum propter verum et bonum: qui itaque multum amavarunt, illi sunt qui vocantur sapientes; qui autem parum amaverunt, sunt qui vocantur simplices; sapientes in caelo in multa luce sunt, simplices autem in caelo in minore luce sunt; quisque secundum gradum amoris boni et veri. Amare verum et bonum propter verum et bonum, est velle illa et facere illa, nam qui volunt et faciunt illi amant, non autem qui non volunt et faciunt: illi etiam sunt qui amant Dominum, et amantur a Domino, quoniam bonum et verum sunt a Domino, et quia sunt a Domino, etiam in illis, nempe in bono et vero, est Dominus; proinde etiam apud illos, qui recipiunt bonum et verum in sua vita per velle et facere. Homo etiam in se spectatus non est nisi quam suum bonum et verum, quia bonum est ejus voluntatis et verum est ejus intellectus, et homo talis est qualis ejus voluntas et intellectus: inde patet, quod homo tantum a Domino ametur, quantum ejus voluntas formata est a bono, et intellectus formatus est a vero. Amari a Domino est quoque amare Dominum, nam amor est reciprocus; dat enim Dominus ei qui amatur ut amet. </p>
