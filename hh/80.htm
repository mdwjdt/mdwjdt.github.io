<h3 align="center" class="ired">《天堂与地狱》 第80节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>80、天使无法感知一位不可见的上帝（他们称之为无形的上帝），而只能感知一位人形的可见的上帝。他们习惯于说，唯独主是人，他们是出于祂而成为人，且各自照着对主的接受程度而成为人。他们所理解的“接受主”，就是接受出于主的良善和真理（因为主在祂的良善和真理中），他们称这为智慧和聪明。他们说，人是出于聪明和智慧的造就，而不是没有这些的一张脸。这一真理在内层天堂天使的外貌上明显地看出来，因为这些天使处在来自主的良善和真理中，因而处在聪明和智慧中，故他们处在最漂亮、最完美的人形中，而低层天堂天使的人形就稍为逊色；另一方面，那些在地狱里的人在天堂的光中几乎不像人，而像是怪物。因为他们不处在良善和真理中，而是处在邪恶和伪谬中，因而处在聪明和智慧的对立面。由于这个原因，他们的生命不称为“生命”，而是称为“灵性的死亡”。</p>
<p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>80. 天使对一位不可见的神性没有任何觉知, 并称其为没有形式的神性, 但能觉知一位人形式的可见神性. 所以他们习惯说, 唯独主是人, 他们凭主而为人, 各自照着对主的接受程度而为人. 他们所说的接受主, 是指接受来自祂的良善与真理, 因为主在祂的良善和真理中, 他们称这为智慧和聪明. 他们说, 众所周知, 构成人的, 是聪明和智慧, 而不是没有这些的一张脸. 这一真理从内层天堂天使的形像明显看出来, 因为这些天使处于来自主的良善与真理, 因而处于智慧与聪明, 故他们所在的人之形式最漂亮, 最完美; 而低层天堂天使所在的人之形式就不那么完美, 漂亮了. 在地狱, 情况恰好相反. 在天堂之光中, 那里的人几乎不成人样, 而是像怪物. 因为他们陷入邪恶与虚假, 而非处于良善与真理, 从而陷入智慧与聪明的对立面. 因此, 他们的生命不能称作生命, 只能称作属灵的死亡. </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>80. 天人既無法想像一位不可見之上帝(他們稱其為無形之上帝), 只能想像一位顯為人形的可見之上帝, 也就常說唯獨主是人;他們得以成為人, 則是因著主的緣故。他們還說, 我們每個人也是按照接收主的程度而成為人。所謂"接受主,"他們理解為接受主的善和理, 因為主臨在於從祂所發的一切善和理當中, 天人稱之為智慧和聰明。使人成為人的是聰明和智慧, 而非外在的形體。<br><br>該事實從內層天天人的形相顯而易見。由於主將他們保守在善與理當中, 保守于智慧與聰明當中, 所以他們呈現最莊嚴最完美的人形。低層天的天人在這方面則要遜色一些。<br><br>地獄的一切則是顛倒的。在天國之光中, 地獄的人幾乎不成人樣, 而像怪物。他們沉迷於邪惡與偽謬, 不接受善與理, 與智慧和聰明全然對立。因此, 他們的生命不能稱為"生命,"只能稱為"靈性的死亡"。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #80 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>80. Since angels do not perceive an invisible Divine Being (which they call a formless Divine) but a visible Divine Being in human form, it is common practice for them to say that only the Lord is a person, and that they are people because of him. They also say that each of us is human in proportion to our acceptance of him. By "accepting the Lord" they understand accepting what is good and true that comes from him, because the Lord is present in everything good and true that comes from himself. Angels call this wisdom and intelligence. They say everyone knows that intelligence and wisdom are what make us human, not simply the outward form by itself. <br><br>The truth of this is actually visible to angels of the inner heavens. Since the Lord keeps them engaged in what is good and true and therefore in wisdom and intelligence, they are in the loveliest and most perfect human form; while the angels of lower heavens are in a less perfect and lovely form. <br><br>Everything is inverted in hell. In heaven's light, the people who are there hardly look human at all. They look like monsters. They are caught up in what is evil and false and not in what is good and true, and are therefore in the opposite of wisdom and intelligence. As a result, their life is not called life, but spiritual death. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #80 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p>80. Because the angels have no perception of an invisible Divine, which they call a Divine devoid of form, but perceive a visible Divine in Human form, they are accustomed to say that the Lord alone is Man, and that they are men from Him, each one being a man in the measure of his reception of the Lord. By receiving the Lord they mean receiving the good and truth which are from Him, since the Lord is in His good and in His truth. This they call wisdom and intelligence. Everyone knows, they say, that it is intelligence and wisdom that make a man, and not a face without these. The truth of this is evident from the appearance of the angels of the interior heavens, for they, being in good and truth from the Lord, and consequently in wisdom and intelligence, are in the most beautiful and perfect human form, while the angels of the lower heavens are in a human form of less perfection and beauty. In hell, the reverse is the case. Those who are there appear in the light of heaven hardly as men, but as monsters. For they are in evil and falsity and not in good and truth, and so are in the opposites of wisdom and intelligence. For this reason, their life is not called life, but spiritual death. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #80 (Ager, 1900)</h4><p>80. Because the angels have no perception of an invisible Divine, which they call a Divine devoid of form, but perceive only a visible Divine in human form, they are accustomed to say that the Lord alone is man, and that it is from Him that they are men, and that each one is a man in the measure of his reception of the Lord. By receiving the Lord they understand receiving good and truth which are from Him, since the Lord is in His good and in His truth, and this they call wisdom and intelligence. Everyone knows, they say, that intelligence and wisdom make man, and not a face without these. The truth of this is made evident from the appearance of the angels of the interior heavens, for these, being in good and truth from the Lord and in consequent wisdom and intelligence, are in a most beautiful and most perfect human form; while the angels of the lower heavens are in human form of less perfection and beauty. On the other hand, those who are in hell appear in the light of heaven hardly as men, but rather as monsters, since they are not in good and truth but in evil and falsity, and consequently in the opposites of wisdom and intelligence. For this reason their life is not called life, but spiritual death. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #80 (original Latin)</h4><p>80. Quia angeli non Divinum invisibile, quod vocant Divinum absque forma, sed Divinum visibile in forma Humana percipiunt, ideo illis commune est dicere, quod solus Dominus sit Homo, et quod illi sint homines ab Ipso et quod unusquisque tantum sit homo, quantum recipit Ipsum. Per recipere Dominum intelligunt recipere bonum et verum quae ab Ipso, quoniam Dominus est in suo bono et in suo vero hoc etiam vocant sapientiam et intelligentiam: dicunt, quod quisque sciat quod intelligentia et sapientia faciant hominem, et non facies absque illis. Quod ita sit, etiam apparet ex angelis interiorum caelorum illi, quia a Domino in bono et vero sunt, et inde in sapientia et intelligentia, in pulcherrima et perfectissima forma humana sunt; et angeli inferiorum caelorum in minus perfecta et pulchra at vice versa in inferno; illi, qui ibi, in luce caeli, vix apparent ut homines, sed ut monstra; sunt enim in malo et falso, et non in bono et vero, et inde in oppositis sapientiae et intelligentiae; quare etiam vita eorum non vocatur vita, sed mors spiritualis. </p>
