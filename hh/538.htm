<h4 align="center"></h4><p>538、我经常得到允许去感知到从地狱流出的出于邪恶的伪谬气场。它就像一种坚持不懈的努力，要摧毁一切良善和真理，还伴随着一种怒气、一种因不能得逞而产生的狂怒，尤其是一种消灭和摧毁主之神性的努力，因为一切良善和真理都来自祂。也感知到来自天堂的出于良善的真理气场，抑制了从地狱中极力升腾的狂怒，从而产生了平衡。感知到的来自天堂的气场唯独出于主，尽管它看似出于天堂里的天使。它唯独出于主，而非出于天使，是因为天堂里的每位天使都承认，没有丝毫的良善和真理出于自己，一切良善和真理都出于主。</p>

<p>538. 我经常被恩准觉知从地狱流出的源于邪恶的虚假气场. 它就像一种持续不懈的努力, 好摧毁一切良善与真理, 还伴随着因不能得逞而发的怒气和一种狂怒, 尤其像一种消灭和摧毁主之神性的努力, 因为一切良善与真理皆来自祂. 我也曾感受过出于天堂的源于良善的真理气场, 从地狱升腾的努力的愤怒由此被节制. 其结果就是一种平衡. 我感觉来自天堂的这种气场唯独出自主, 尽管它看似出自天堂里的天使. 它之所以唯独出自主, 而非天使, 是因为在天堂, 每位天使都承认良善与真理丝毫不出于自己, 全都出于主. </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>538. 有時, 我被允許感受從地獄所發出的惡與謬的氣息。它就像一股力量, 片刻不息地意欲摧毀一切善與理, 其中夾雜著因不能得逞而蓄積的怒氣。它尤其意欲摧毀主的神性, 因為一切善與理源於主。<br><br>我也曾感受從天國所發出的善與理的氣息, 它是一股節制地獄憤怒的力量, 從而產生一種平衡。我感覺出該氣息完全來自主, 雖然它看似出於天國的天人。天人無不承認善與理全出於主, 而非出於自己。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #538 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>538. I have sometimes been allowed to sense the aura of malevolent falsity flowing out of hell. It was like a constant effort to destroy everything good and true, united to an anger, a kind of rage at not being able to do so. Especially, it was an effort to destroy the divine nature of the Lord because this is the source of everything good and true. <br><br>I have sensed an aura of benevolent truth from heaven, though, that served to restrain the rage of the effort rising up from hell, which yielded an equilibrium. I perceived that the sole source of this aura was the Lord, even though it seemed to be coming from angels in heaven. The reason it comes solely from the Lord and not from angels is that every angel in heaven admits that nothing of what is good and true comes from herself or himself, but that it all comes from the Lord. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #538 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p> 538. A perception of the sphere of falsity from the evil that flows forth from hell has often been granted me. It was like a perpetual effort to destroy all that is good and true, combined with anger and a kind of fury at not being able to do so, especially an effort to annihilate and destroy the Divine of the Lord, and this because all good and truth are from Him. But out of heaven a sphere of truth from good was perceived, whereby the fury of the effort ascending out of hell was restrained. The result of this was an equilibrium. This sphere from heaven was perceived to come from the Lord alone, although it appeared to come from the angels in heaven. It was from the Lord alone, and not from the angels, because every angel in heaven acknowledges that nothing of good and of truth is from himself; but all is from the Lord. </p><p align="center">------------</p>

<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #538 (original Latin)</h4><p>538. Datum est aliquoties percipere sphaeram falsi ex malo effluentem ex inferno: erat illa sicut perpetuus conatus destruendi omne bonum et verum, conjunctus irae et quasi furori quod non possent imprimis conatus annihilandi et destruendi Divinum Domini, et hoc quia ab Ipso omne bonum et verum. Ex caelo autem percepta est sphaera veri ex bono, per quam refrenatus est furor conatus ascendentis ex inferno unde aequilibrium. Haec sphaera a caelo percepta erat a solo Domino, tametsi apparuit ex angelis in caelo: quod a solo Domino et non ab angelis, erat quia unusquisque angelus in caelo agnoscit quod nihil boni et veri sit a semet, sed quod omne a Domino. </p>
