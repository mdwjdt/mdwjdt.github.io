<h3 align="center" class="ired">《天堂与地狱》 第453节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">四十七、人死后是完整的人</h4><br><br>
453、从前面几章已经说明的内容可以证实，人的灵是人的形状，也就是说，灵甚至在形状上也是人：说明每位天使都在完整的人形中（<a href="../hh/73.htm">73</a>-<a href="../hh/77.htm">77</a>）；就其内层而言，每个人都是一个灵（<a href="../hh/432.htm">432</a>-<a href="../hh/444.htm">444</a>）；天堂里的天使来自人类（<a href="../hh/311.htm">311</a>-<a href="../hh/317.htm">317</a>）。<br><br>
[2]这一点从以下事实看得更清楚：人之所以成为人，是由于他的灵，而不是因为他的身体，肉体的形状是照着灵的形状加到灵上的，而不是相反，因为灵披上了一具与它自己的形状相称的身体。因此，人的灵作用于身体的每个部分，甚至是最细微的部分，以至于如果任何一个部位不被灵驱动，或者灵在其中不活跃，它就不能存活。任何人仅从以下事实中都能认识到这是真实的：思想和意志以这样一种完整的命令来驱动身体中的一切事物、每个事物，以至于一切事物都一致，任何不一致的都不是身体的一部分，而是被当作没有生命的东西被抛弃。思想和意志不属于身体，而是属于人的灵。<br><br>
[3]灵从身体中被释放出来后处在人形中，世人看不见，也看不见灵在他人里面，这是因为身体的视觉器官，或肉眼，就其在尘世观看来说，是物质器官。物质的器官只能看见物质的东西，而属灵的器官才能看见灵性的东西。因此，当眼睛的物质部分变暗，失去与灵的合作时，眼睛就看到灵以自己的形状存在，也就是人的形状。不仅看见灵界中的灵人，而且还能看见尚在身体中的另一个人的灵。</p>
<p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>453. 四十七, 人死后处于完整的人形<br><br>前面几个章节已经说明, 人之灵的形式是人的形式, 也就是说, 灵甚至在形式上也是一个人; 那里尤其说明: 每位天使都拥有一个完整的人形(<a href="../ac/73.htm">天国的奥秘 73-77</a>节); 就其内层而言, 每个人都是一个灵(<a href="../ac/432.htm">天国的奥秘 432-444</a>节); 天堂天使来自人类(<a href="../ac/311.htm">天国的奥秘 311-317</a>节).<br><br>这一点从以下事实看得更清楚: 人之为人, 凭的是他的灵, 而非他的身体, 身体形式照着灵的形式而被附加到灵上, 而不是反过来, 因为灵披上了一具适合自己形式的身体. 因此, 人的灵作用于身体的每个部位, 甚至作用于最细微之处, 以致若有任何部位不受灵驱使, 或灵在它里面不起作用, 它就没法存活. 单单从以下事实, 谁都能认识到这一点: 思维和意愿绝对激活身体中的一切事物, 并掌控得如此彻底, 以致一切事物都同意; 但凡有不同意的, 都不会成为身体的一部分, 而是被当作某种无生命之物被逐出; 思维和意愿属于人的灵, 而非身体.<br><br>离开身体的灵或另一个人里面的灵, 其人的形式是不为人所见的, 因为身体的视觉器官, 或肉眼只要在世间观看, 就是物质器官; 物质只能看见物质, 而属灵物能看见属灵物. 因此, 当眼睛的物质部分变暗, 不能与灵合作时, 眼睛就看见在自己的形式, 也就是人形式中的灵, 不仅看见灵界中的灵, 还看见尚在其身体中的另一人的灵. </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>453. 死後仍是人<br><br>靈呈人形, 前文的"天人呈人形"(<a href="73.htm">73-77</a>),"人是個靈"(<a href="432.htm">432-444</a>)中有述。<br><br>另外, 從以下事實, 人更能清楚地把握這一點:人之為人, 是憑著靈, 不是憑著肉體, 肉體是照靈的形狀而附於其上, 靈照自己的形狀披上了肉體。因此, 靈活動於肉體的每個部分, 直至細微處, 任何部位若無靈活動其間, 就沒有生命。人不難認識這一點, 因為認知和意志驅動並控制著整個肉體, 若有任何部位不聽從指令, 就不是肉體的一部分, 裡頭就沒有生命。而認知和意志是靈的屬性, 非肉體的屬性。<br><br>一個靈離開肉體後, 人們看不到這個呈人形的靈;在肉體中的靈, 同樣看不見。人身的視覺器官, 或說人的眼, 是物質的。物質器官只能看見物質的東西, 心靈器官才能看見心靈的東西。所以, 當眼睛的物質屬性衰敗並喪失與其心靈屬性的合作時, 靈就顯現出他們的形狀來, 也就是人形;不僅生活在心靈世界的靈, 甚至依然生活在肉體內的靈, 其形狀都是人形。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #453 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>453. After Death, We Are in a Complete Human Form <br><br>The fact that the form of a spirit-person is the human form or that a spirit is a person as far as form is concerned follows from what has been presented in a number of the earlier chapters, especially where I explained that every angel is in a perfect human form (<a href="73.htm">73-77</a>), that everyone is a spirit inwardly (<a href="432.htm">432-444</a>), and that the angels in heaven are from the human race (<a href="311.htm">311-317</a>).<p> </p><p>[2] This may be grasped even more clearly from the fact that we are human because of our spirit, not because of our body, and because our physical form is appended to the spirit in keeping with its form, not the other way around, since a spirit is clothed with a body that suits its form. As a result, the human spirit acts upon the individual parts of the body, even the smallest ones, even to the point that any part that is not activated by the spirit, any part in which there is no spirit acting, is not alive. Anyone may realize this by considering that thought and intent activate absolutely everything in the body and are so completely in control that nothing dissents, and that if anything does not consent it is not part of the body. It is actually expelled as something with no life in it. Thought and intent are attributes of our spirit, not of the body.<p> </p><p>[3] The reason we cannot see the human form of spirits who have left the body and spirits still within the people we meet is that our physical organ of sight, the eye, is material to the extent that it can see in this world, and what is material sees only what is material. What is spiritual, though, does see what is spiritual; so when the material eye is covered over and loses its coordination with the spirit, then spirit is visible in its own form. This is a human form not only for spirits who are in the spiritual world but also for spirits in people we meet while they are still in their bodies. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #453 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p>453. MAN AFTER DEATH IS IN A COMPLETE HUMAN FORM <br><br>It can be confirmed from things already shown in several previous sections that the form of the spirit of man is the human form, that is, that the spirit is a man even in form, especially where it is shown that every angel is in a complete human form (<a href="73.htm">73-77</a>); that in respect of his interiors every man is a spirit (<a href="432.htm">432-444</a>); and that the angels in heaven are from the human race (<a href="311.htm">311-317</a>). <p> </p><p>[2] This can be seen still more clearly from the fact that it is by virtue of his spirit, and not by virtue of his body, that man is a man, and that the corporeal form is added to the spirit in accordance with the spirit's form, and not the reverse, for it is in accordance with its own form that the spirit is clothed with a body. Consequently, the spirit of man acts into every part of the body, even the minutest, insomuch that if any part is not actuated by the spirit, or the spirit is not active in it, it does not live. Anyone can know that this is true from this fact alone, that thought and will actuate all things and each thing of the body with such entire command that everything concurs, and anything that does not concur is not a part of the body, but is cast out as something without life; and thought and will belong, not to the body, but to the spirit of man. <p> </p><p>[3] A spirit is not visible in the human form to man after it has been loosed from the body, nor does he see the spirit in another man, because the body's organ of sight, or its eye, so far as it sees in the world, is a material organ, and what is material can see only what is material, while what is spiritual sees what is spiritual. When, therefore, the material part of the eye becomes darkened and is deprived of its co-operation with the spiritual, then the spirits appear in their own form, which is the human form, not only the spirits who are in the spiritual world, but also the spirit of another man while it is yet in its body. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #453 (Ager, 1900)</h4><p>453. MAN AFTER DEATH IS IN A COMPLETE HUMAN FORM<br><br>It has already been shown in several previous chapters that the form of the spirit of man is the human form, that is, that the spirit is a man even in form, especially where it is shown that every angel has a complete human form (<a href="73.htm">73-77</a>) that in respect to his interiors every man is a spirit (<a href="432.htm">432-444</a>); and that the angels in heaven are from the human race (<a href="311.htm">311-317</a>).<br><br>[2] This can be seen still more clearly from the fact that it is by virtue of his spirit, and not by virtue of his body that man is a man, and that the bodily form is added to the spirit in accordance with the spirit's form, and not the reverse, for it is in accordance with its own form that the spirit is clothed with a body. Consequently the spirit of man acts into every part of the body, even the minutest, insomuch that if any part is not actuated by the spirit, or the spirit is not active in it, it does not live.

When, therefore, the material part of the eye becomes darkened and is deprived of its cooperation with the spiritual, the eye sees spirits in their own form, which is the human form, not only the spirits that are in the spiritual world, but also the spirit of another man while it is yet in its body. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #453 (original Latin)</h4><p>453. [XLVII.] QUOD HOMO POST MORTEM SIT IN PERFECTA FORMA HUMANA.<br><br>Quod forma spiritus hominis sit forma humana, seu quod spiritus sit homo etiam quoad formam, constare potest ex illis, quae in pluribus articulis supra ostensa sunt; imprimis in illis ubi ostensum est, quod unusquisque angelus sit in perfecta forma humana (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_453/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_73" target=_top>73-77</a>); et quod unusquisque homo sit spiritus quoad interiora sua (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_453/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_432" target=_top>432-444</a>); et quod angeli in caelo sint ex humano genere (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_453/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_311" target=_top>311-317</a>).<br><br> <br>[2] Hoc adhuc clarius ex eo potest perspici, quod homo sit homo ex suo spiritu, et non ex corpore; et quod corporea forma sit adjecta spiritui secundum ejus formam, et non vicissim; nam spiritus indutus est corpore secundum suam formam: quapropter spiritus hominis agit in singula, immo in singularissima corporis, usque adeo, ut pars quae non agitur a spiritu, seu in quia non est spiritus agens, non vivat. Quod ita sit, quisque potest scire ex eo solo, quod cogitatio et voluntas agat omnia et singula corporis, ita prorsus ad suum nutum ut nihil non concurrat, et quod non concurrit non sit pars corporis; ejicitur etiam sicut in qua non vivum: cogitatio et voluntas sunt spiritus hominis, et non corporis.<br><br> <br>[3] Quod spiritus non appareat homini in forma humana, postquam solutus est a corpore, nec in altero homine, est quia organum visus corporis seu ejus oculus, quantum videt in mundo, est materialis, et materiale non videt nisi quam materiale, at spirituale videt spirituale; quapropter cum materiale oculi obvelatur ac privatur sua cooperatione cum spirituali, tunc apparent spiritus in sua forma, quae est <sup>1</sup>humana; non solum spiritus qui in mundo spirituali sunt, sed etiam spiritus qui in altero dum adhuc in suo corpore est.<br><br> <br><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br><div class="footnote-section"><br>1.&nbsp;Post "humana" fixi semicolon. </p>
