<h3 align="center" class="ired">《天堂与地狱》 第343节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>343、有好几次，我和一群还处在纯粹幼稚状态<a href="#a413">｛注1｝</a>的小孩子一起在唱诗班，听上去他们发出一种柔嫩、参差不齐的声音，还没有表现为一个整体（像他们后来变得更成熟时所做的那样）。令我惊讶的是，与我同在的灵人情不自禁地逗他们说话，这是灵人天生的欲望。但我注意到，每次孩子们都拒绝，不愿意这样说话。我经常感知到他们的拒绝和抵触，还伴随着一种气恼。当给他们机会说话时，他们除了说“不要这样”外，什么也不说。我被告知，小孩子们这样被试探，是为了使他们习惯去拒绝，并从一开始就抵制伪谬和邪恶，学会不从别人那里思考、说话和行动，从而学会只允许自己单单被主引导。<br><br>
<a name="a413">｛注1｝</a>：【英222】“幼稚状态”是原文的字面意思，此句也有翻译成“在他们完全学会说话之前”。上下文表明，“幼稚”（infantile）原文的词源意义是“不说话”。</p>

<p>343. 有几次, 有许多处于纯婴儿状态的孩子与我同在唱诗班. 他们还不会说话, 只发出一种娇嫩, 不成形的声音, 尚不能像后来他们变得更成熟时那样行如一体. 令我惊讶的是, 与我同在的灵人忍不住引诱他们说话. 这种欲望是灵人所固有的. 但我注意到, 每次孩子们都加以抵制, 不愿以这种方式说话. 我经常感受到他们的拒绝和抵制, 还伴随着一种气恼; 当有机会说话时, 他们只说一句: “不是这样”. 我被告知, 这是对孩子的一种试探, 好叫他们习惯并开始抵制虚假与邪恶, 学会不按别人的要求思考, 说话和行动, 因而除了主以外, 不让自己被任何人引导. </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>343. 有好幾次, 我與一群唱詩班的孩子在一起。他們還不會說話, 只發出一種嬌嫩的, 不成形的聲音, 尚不能像成人那樣完美地和聲。有趣的是, 與我同在的靈情不自禁地想逗他們說話, 這是他們的秉性。我注意到, 孩子們每次都表示抗拒, 不願那樣說話。我每每感覺到孩子們遲疑, 反感, 抵觸的情緒。有一次他們當真說了話, 卻只是說"不是那樣的"。我被告知, 這是對孩子的一種試驗, 使他們習慣於抵制邪惡和謬誤, 在思想, 言語, 行為上不盲從, 單單接受主的引導。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #343 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>343. Several times a number of children have been with me in groups, before they had learned to talk at all. They made a soft, formless sound, as though they were not yet able to act together the way they would when they were older. What surprised me was that the spirits who were with me could not keep from trying to get them to talk - this kind of impulse is innate in spirits. Every time, though, I noticed that the children resisted, not wanting to talk like that. I often picked up a reluctance, a distaste, that had a kind of resentment in it. Once they did have some power of speech, all they said was "That isn't so." I was told that this is a kind of testing of the children not only to accustom and introduce them to resisting whatever is false and evil but to keep them from thinking or speaking or acting at the bidding of someone else, so that they will not let themselves be led by anyone but the Lord. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #343 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p> 343. Several times when a number of little children who were as yet in a purely infantile state have been with me in choirs, they were heard as a tender unarranged mass, that is, as not yet acting as one, as they do later when they have become more mature. And, what was wonderful, the spirits with me could not refrain from inducing them to talk. This desire is innate in spirits. But I noticed, each time, that the little children were resisting, not wishing to talk in this way. This refusal and resistance, which were accompanied by a kind of indignation, I have often perceived; and when an opportunity to talk was given them they would say nothing except that "It is not so." I have been taught that little children are so tempted in order that they may become accustomed to resisting, and may begin not only to resist falsity and evil, but also may learn not to think, speak, and act, from another, and in consequence may learn to permit themselves to be led by no one but the Lord. </p><p align="center">------------</p>

<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #343 (original Latin)</h4><p>343. Pluries cum aliquot infantes simul apud me fuerunt in choris, quum adhuc prorsus infantiles essent, auditi sunt sicut tenerum inordinatum, sic ut nondum sicut unum agerent, quemadmodum dein cum adulteriores facti sunt; et, quod miratus, spiritus apud me non potuerunt se retinere, quin eos ducerent ad loquendum innata est spiritibus talis cupido sed observatum toties, quod infantes repugnarent, non volentes ita loqui: renuentiam et repugnantiam, quae erat cum quadam specie indignationis, saepius appercepi; cumque illis datum est aliquid copiae loquendi, dicebant modo quod non ita sit. Instructus sum, quod talis sit infantum tentatio, ut adsuescant et inaugurentur non modo ad resistendum falso et malo, sed etiam ut non ab alio cogitent, loquantur, et agant, proinde ut non ab alio patiantur se duci, quam a solo Domino. </p>
