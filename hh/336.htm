<h4 align="center"></h4><p>336、这也表明孩子们的理智是何等的柔嫩。当我念诵主祷文时，他们的理解流入我的思想观念中，我感知到这流注是如此稚嫩和温柔，以至于几乎只是一种情感。同时，我发现他们的理智甚至向主敞开，因为从他们所流出的仿佛是流经他们而来的。此外，主流入小孩子的意念，主要来自至内层，因为与成年人不同，没有什么能关闭他们的意念：没有伪谬的原则来关闭理解真理的道路，也没有任何邪恶的生活关闭接受良善、从而关闭接受智慧的道路。这一切清楚地表明，小孩子死后不会立刻进入天使的状态，而是通过对良善和真理的认知而逐渐被带入天使的状态，并与所有天堂的秩序和谐一致。因为主知道他们秉性的最小细节，因而按照他们意向的每一个细微活动，引导他们接受源自良善的真理和出于真理所行的良善。</p>

<p>336. 我也被指示孩子的理解力何等娇嫩. 当我念诵主祷文, 他们出于自己的理解流入我的思维观念时, 我发觉他们的流注如此娇嫩, 柔和, 以致它几乎只是一种情感. 同时, 我发现他们的理解力向主敞开, 因为从他们所流出的, 仿佛仅仅流经他们. 而事实上, 主流入小孩子的观念, 主要是从至内层. 因为和成人不一样, 没有什么东西关闭他们的观念, 虚假的原则没有关闭通向对真理的理解之路, 也没有任何邪恶的生活关闭通向对良善的接受, 由此通向对智慧的接受之路. 这一切清楚表明, 小孩子死后并非立刻进入天使的状态, 而是通过对良善与真理的认知, 照着天堂的一切秩序逐渐被带入天使的状态. 因为主知道他们性质的最小细节, 因而照其倾向的每一个细微动作引导他们接受良善所产生的真理和真理所成就的良善. </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>336. 我還被指示孩子的認知是何等微妙。我讀誦主禱文的時候, 他們的領悟流入我的思想。我注意到他們的流入非常微妙柔和, 幾乎只是一種感受。同時, 我注意到他們的認知已向主敞開, 因為出於他們的仿佛是從主流經他們。事實上, 主流入孩子的思想, 主要是通過他們的至內在部分, 因為那裡沒有像成人那樣被封閉, 沒有錯謬的原則來阻礙對真理的認知, 沒有邪惡的生活來攔阻對良善, 因而對智慧的感受。<br><br>綜上所述, 孩子死後並非立刻成為天人, 而是通過覺悟良善與真理, 照天國的順序, 逐漸成為天人。因為主瞭解他們的秉性, 無微不至, 也就照其細微的傾向和衝動, 引導他們去接受善之理和理之善。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #336 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>336. I was also shown the nature of their delicate understanding. When I was saying the Lord's Prayer and they were flowing into my concepts from their own comprehension, I noticed that their inflow was so delicate and gentle that it was almost nothing but a feeling. At the same time, I noted that their understanding had been opened to the Lord, for it was as though what was coming from them was flowing through them. In fact, the Lord flows into children's concepts, primarily from the deepest ones. Nothing has closed these off, as happens with adults - no principles of falsity closing them off from true understanding, no life of evil closing them off from accepting what is good and thus from being wise. <br><br>We may gather from all this that children do not become angels immediately after their death but are gradually led [into heaven] through awareness of what is good and true, all according to the design of heaven. This is because the least details of their nature are known to the Lord, so they are led, in cooperation with every least impulse of their inclinations, toward the acceptance of truths that arise from good and the good that is done from truth. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #336 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p> 336. It was also shown how tender their understanding is. When I was praying the Lord's Prayer, and from their understanding they flowed into the ideas of my thought, their influx was perceived to be so tender and soft as to be almost solely a matter of affection; and at the same time it was then observed that their understanding was open even from the Lord, for what flowed forth from them was as if it simply flowed through them. Moreover, the Lord flows into the ideas of little children chiefly from inmosts, for there is nothing, as with adults, to close up their ideas, no principles of falsity to close the way to the understanding of truth, nor any life of evil to close the way to the reception of good, and thereby the way to wisdom. From these things it can be confirmed that little children do not come at once after death into an angelic state, but are gradually brought into it successively by means of cognitions of good and truth, and this in harmony with all heavenly order; for the least particulars of their disposition are known to the Lord, and thus they are led, in accord with each and every movement of their inclination, to receive the truths of good and the goods of truth. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #336 (Ager, 1900)</h4><p>336. It was also shown how tender their understanding is. When I was praying the Lord's Prayer, and from their under standing they flowed into the ideas of my thought, their influx was perceived to be so tender and soft as to be almost solely a matter of affection; and at the same time it was observed that their understanding was open even from the Lord, for what flowed forth from them was as if it simply flowed through them. Moreover, the Lord flows into the ideas of little children chiefly from inmosts, for there is nothing, as with adults, to close up their ideas, no principles of falsity to close the way to the understanding of truth, nor any life of evil to close the way to the reception of good, and thereby to the reception of wisdom. All this makes clear that little children do not come at once after death into an angelic state, but are gradually brought into it by means of knowledges of good and truth, and in harmony with all heavenly order; for the least particulars of their nature are known to the Lord, and thus they are led, in accord with each and every movement of their inclination, to receive the truths of good and the goods of truth. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #336 (original Latin)</h4><p>336. Qualis illorum tener intellectus est, etiam ostensum est. Cum Orationem Domini orarem, et illi tunc in ideas cogitationis meae influerent ex suo intellectuali, appercipiebatur quod influxus eorum esset tam tener et mollis, ut paene esset solius affectionis et simul tunc observabatur, quod intellectuale eorum esset apertum usque a Domino, nam erat sicut transfluens quod ab illis. Dominus etiam in infantum ideas praeprimis ab intimis influit, nihil enim illas clausit, sicut apud adultos; nulla principia falsi ad intelligendum verum, nec vita mali ad recipiendum bonum, et sic ad sapiendum. Ex his constare potest, quod infantes non illico post mortem in statum angelicum veniant, sed quod per cognitiones boni et veri successive introducantur, et hoc secundum omnem ordinem caelestem nam omnium minima eorum indolis Domino nota sunt, quare secundum omnia et singula momenta eorum inclinationis ducuntur ad recipiendum vera boni et bona veri. </p>
