<h3 align="center" class="ired">《天堂与地狱》 第506节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>506、凡在世上过着良善的生活、照着良心行事的人，他们承认上帝、热爱神性真理，尤其是那些将这些真理应用于生活的人，当他们被引入到自己的内层状态时，他们觉得自己仿佛是从睡梦中全然清醒或出黑暗入光明。这时，他们出于天堂之光、因而出于内层的智慧思考；并出于良善、因而出于内层的情感行事。天堂甚至带着一种他们以前不知道的内层的幸福和喜悦流入他们的思想和情感，因为他们与天堂的天使有沟通。这时，他们承认主，并出于自己真正的生命来敬拜祂，因为，当他们处在自己的内层状态时，就是在自己的真正的生命里（如刚才所述<a href="../hh/505.htm">505</a>）。因为自由属于内层的情感，所以，那时他们在自由中承认并敬拜主。就这样，他们脱离外在的圣洁，进入内在的圣洁——它真正包含着敬拜本身。这就是那些照着圣经的诫命过着基督徒生活的人的状态。<br><br>
[2]但那些在世上过着邪恶生活的人，他们没有良心，因此否认上帝，他们的状态恰恰相反。凡过着邪恶生活的人都从内心否认上帝，无论他们在外在的思想中以为自己是多么承认主、不否认祂。因为承认上帝与过着邪恶的生活是对立的。当这种人在来世进入他们的内层状态时，他们的言谈举止显得很愚蠢，因为他们出于恶欲而行各样可憎的事情：蔑视、嘲笑他人，以及亵渎、敌意和报复。他们策划阴谋，有些阴谋诡计狡猾且恶毒，难以相信在任何人里面会有这样的事。那时他们自由地按照自己意志的思想行事，因为他们脱离了在世时约束和制约他们的外在事物。总之，他们被剥夺了理性，因为在世时他们的理性没有处在他们的内层，而是处在他们的外层。然而，在他们自己看来，他们比谁都更有智慧。<br><br>
[3]这就是他们的性格。当他们处在第二个状态时，他们会短暂地被带回到外层的状态，他们便回想起自己在内层状态时的所作所为，此时，有的感到羞愧，承认自己疯了；有的却不觉得羞愧；有的很生气，因为他们不被允许永久地保持在他们的外层状态。但这些人被展示，如果他们继续处在那种状态将会怎样，即他们会企图以秘密的方式达到同样的邪恶目的，并以善良、诚实和公正的外表，误导内心和信仰单纯的人，从而彻底地毁灭自己。因为他们的外层终将像他们的内层一样燃烧，这会消耗他们的整个生命。</p>
<p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>506. 凡在世上过着良善生活, 照良心行事的人, 也就是承认神性, 热爱神性真理的人, 尤其将这些真理运用于生活的人, 当被引入其内层状态时, 觉得自己仿佛从沉睡中完全醒来, 或从黑暗进入光明. 这时, 他出于天堂之光, 因而出于一种内在智慧进行思考, 并出于良善, 因而出于一种内在情感行事. 天堂以一种他们前所未知的幸福和快乐流入他们的思维和情感. 这是因为他们与天堂天使相联. 这时, 他们也承认主, 并用自己的生命敬拜祂, 因为当他们处于其内层状态时, 便处于自己的生命(如刚才所述, <a href="505.htm">505</a>节). 他们还在自由中承认并敬拜主, 因为自由属于内在情感. 他们便以这种方式脱离外在圣洁, 进入内在圣洁, 而内在圣洁是真敬拜的本质. 这就是那些照圣言的诫命过基督徒生活之人的状态.<br><br>而那些在世上过着邪恶生活, 没有良心, 并因此否认神性之人的状态恰恰相反. 事实上, 凡过着邪恶生活的人都从内在否认神性, 无论他们处于外在思维时如何自以为承认主, 并未否认祂. 这是因为承认神性与过邪恶生活是对立面. 当这种人在来世进入其内层状态, 人们听见他们说话, 看见他们做事时, 他们显得很愚蠢; 因为他们在恶欲的驱使下冲进各种恶行, 冲进对他人的蔑视, 以及嘲笑, 亵渎, 仇恨和报复中. 他们策划阴谋, 其中有些阴谋如此狡猾, 恶毒, 以至于你几乎不相信像这样的事竟然存在于人里面. 此时, 他们照其意愿的思维自由行事, 因为他们脱离了在世时约束并抑制他们的外在因素. 简言之, 他们已丧失理性, 因为在世时其理性并未居于其内层, 而是居于其外层. 然而, 他们却觉得自己比谁都智慧.<br><br>这就是他们的秉性. 一旦这种人处于第二个状态, 他们会短暂地被带回到其外层状态. 那时, 他们便回想起自己处于内层状态时所行的; 有的感到羞愧, 承认他们疯了; 有的却不觉得羞愧; 有的为以下事实而愤恨, 他们未被允许一直处于其外层状态. 但这些人被指示, 他们若继续处于这种状态会是什么样, 即: 他们会不断试图暗中做同样的事, 并利用善良, 诚实, 公正的假象误导内心和信仰简单的人, 把自己彻底毁灭; 因为他们的外层终究会燃起如其内层那样的大火, 这会焚毁其整个生命. </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>506. 在世時凡專注于善良的生活, 依照良心而行的人, 也就是承認上帝, 熱愛神性真理, 特別是將真理運用於生活的人, 當他們進入內在的層面以後, 有如夢初醒或由暗入明的感覺。他們憑天國之光思想, 進入內在的智慧之中。他們依善而行, 進入內在的情感之中。天國流入其思想和情感, 將前所未知的幸福和快樂注入其中, 因為他們是與天國的天人相聯的。他們承認主, 以實際生活表達對主的崇拜, 因為當他們處於外在的層面時是照其秉性而行(<a href="505.htm">505</a>)。他們在自由中承認主, 敬拜主, 因為自由屬於內在的情感。就這樣, 他們從外在的聖潔進入內在的聖潔之中, 而內在的聖潔乃是敬拜的本質, 這是照聖言的要求而生活的人將進入的狀態。<br><br>在世時沉迷於惡, 無良心, 否認上帝者, 情況截然不同。凡過罪惡生活者無不從心裡否認上帝, 不論其表面如何承認上帝。因為承認上帝與過罪惡生活是全然對立的。在靈界, 當他們進入內在層面以後, 其言行舉止顯得相當愚癡, 因為惡欲驅使他們造作惡事, 包括鄙夷, 嘲笑, 譭謗, 仇視, 報復, 等等。他們圖謀惡計, 詭詐惡毒的程度令人難以置信。此時, 他們自由地照意志和思想行事, 因為曾在人間約束他們的外在因素已被分離。簡而言之, 他們已喪失理智, 因為在世之時, 他們的理智並非處於內層, 而是處於外層。但是, 在他們自己看來, 好似他們比任何人都更有智慧。<br><br>進入第二個狀態以後, 他們還會偶爾短暫地被帶回外在的狀態。彼時, 他們想起自己在外在狀態下的行為方式。有的會感到啟尬, 承認自己喪失了理智。有的一點也不覺得慚愧。有的為不能一直留在外在的狀態而感到憤恨。他們被告知一直留在那狀態, 後果會是怎樣。他們一定會虛假地做同樣的事, 以表面的善良, 誠實, 公平誤導心地單純, 思想簡單的人, 同時也會毀滅自己, 因為他們的外在層面終究會如內在層面那樣燃燒起來, 將整個生命摧毀。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #506 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>506. All the people who have lived lives in the world focused on what is good and have acted in accord with their consciences - that is, people who have acknowledged the Divine Being and loved divine truths, and especially people who have applied them to their lives - seem to themselves to have awakened from sleep when they are let into this state of their more inward concerns, like people who have come from darkness into light. They are actually thinking from heaven's light and therefore from a deeper wisdom; and they are acting from what is good and therefore from a deeper affection. Heaven is flowing into their thoughts and affections with a profound feeling of blessedness and pleasure that they had never known before. This is because they are in touch with heaven's angels. Then too, they acknowledge the Lord and worship him with their very lives, because they are engaged in their own lives when they are in this state of more inward concerns (as noted just above in <a href="505.htm">505</a>). They are also acknowledging and worshiping him in freedom, since freedom is a matter of our deeper affection. In this way they move away from an outward holiness and into the inner holiness that is the essence of real worship. This is the state of people who have lived a Christian life in accordance with the precepts of the Word.<p> </p><p>[2] Quite the opposite, though, is the state of people who in the world lived lives focused on evil, who had no conscience and therefore denied the Divine Being; for all the people who live in evil deny the Divine Being inwardly, no matter how convinced they are outwardly that they are not denying but acknowledging. This is because acknowledging the Divine Being and living in evil are opposites. When people like this come into the state of their deeper concerns in the other life, they seem foolish when people hear them talk or see them act, because their evil impulses impel them to break out into wicked deeds - into contempt for others, into derision and blasphemy, hatred, and vengefulness. They cook up plots, some of them with such ingenuity and malice that you would scarcely believe anything like this existed in any human being. They are then free to act in accord with the thoughts of their intentions because they are separated from the more outward factors that constrained them in the world. In short, they lose their rationality because in the world their rationality did not dwell in their deeper natures but in their outer ones. Still, they seem to themselves to be wiser than anyone else.<p> </p><p>[3] Once people like this are in the second state, they are let back into the state of their more outward concerns for brief periods of time. They then retain a memory of how they behaved when they were in the state of their more inward concerns. Some of them are embarrassed, and admit that they were insane. Some of them are not embarrassed at all. Some of them resent the fact that they are not allowed to be in the state of their more outward concerns all the time, but they are shown what they would be like if they were constantly in this state. They would be constantly trying to do the same things covertly, misleading people of simple heart and faith with simulations of goodness, honesty, and fairness. They would destroy themselves completely, because eventually their outer natures would be ablaze with the same fire as their inner natures; and this would consume their whole life. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #506 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p>506. All who have lived a good life in the world and have acted from conscience, who are such as have acknowledged the Divine and have loved Divine truths, especially such as have applied those truths to life, seem to themselves, when let into the state of their interiors, like those aroused from sleep into full wakefulness, or like people passing from darkness into light. They then think from the light of heaven, thus from an interior wisdom, and they act from good, thus from an interior affection. Heaven even flows into their thoughts and affections with an interior blessedness and delight of which they had previously had no knowledge; for they have communication with the angels of heaven. They then acknowledge the Lord and worship Him from their very life, for, being in the state of their interiors, they are in their own life (as has been said just above, <a href="505.htm">505</a>); and as freedom pertains to interior affection they then acknowledge and worship the Lord from freedom. Thus, too, they withdraw from external sanctity and come into that internal sanctity in which worship itself truly consists. Such is the state of those who have lived a Christian life in accordance with the commandments in the Word. <p> </p><p>[2] But the state of those who have lived an evil life in the world and who have had no conscience, and have in consequence denied the Divine, is the direct opposite of this. For all who live an evil life, inwardly in themselves deny the Divine, however much they may suppose when in external thought that they acknowledge the Lord and do not deny Him; for acknowledging the Divine and living an evil life are opposites. When such in the other life come into the state of their interiors, and are heard speaking and seen acting, they appear foolish; for from their evil lusts they burst forth into all sorts of abominations, into contempt of others, ridicule and blasphemy, hatred and revenge; they plot intrigues, some with a cunning and malice that can scarcely be believed to be possible in any man. For they are then in a state of freedom to act in harmony with the thoughts of their will, since they are separated from the exterior things that restrained and checked them in the world. In a word, they are deprived of their rationality, because while they were in the world, what is rational did not have its seat in their interiors, but in their exteriors; and yet they seemed to themselves to be wiser than others. <p> </p><p>[3] This being their character, while in the second state they are let down for short intervals into the state of their exteriors, and into a recollection of their actions when they were in the state of their interiors. Some of them then feel ashamed, and acknowledge that they have been insane; some do not feel ashamed; and some are angry because they are not permitted to remain permanently in the state of their exteriors. But these are shown what they would be if they were to continue in that state, namely, that they would attempt to accomplish in secret ways the same evil ends, and by semblances of goodness, honesty, and justice, would mislead the simple in heart and faith, and would utterly destroy themselves; for their exteriors would at length burn with the same fire as their interiors, and this would consume their whole life. </p><p align="center">------------</p>

<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #506 (original Latin)</h4><p>506. Omnes qui in bono vixerunt in mundo, et ex conscientia egerunt, qui sunt qui agnoverunt Divinum, et amaverunt Divina vera, imprimis qui applicuerunt illa vitae, apparent sibi, cum in statum interiorum suorum mittuntur, sicut qui expergefacti a somno in vigiliam veniunt, et sicut qui ex umbra in lucem. Cogitant etiam ex luce caeli sic ex interiore sapientia, et ex bono agunt sic ex interiore affectione: influit etiam caelum in eorum cogitationes et affectiones cum beato et jucundo interiore, de quo prius non noverunt; nam illi communicationem habent cum angelis caeli; tunc etiam agnoscunt Dominum, et colunt Ipsum ex ipsa vita sua, nam in vita sua propria sunt, quando in statu interiorum suorum, ut mox supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_506/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_505" target=_top>505</a>) dictum est et quoque agnoscunt et colunt Ipsum ex libero, nam liberum est interioris affectionis. Recedunt etiam sic a sancto externo et veniunt in sanctum internum, in quo ipse cultus vere consistit talis est status illorum, qui secundum praecepta in Verbo Christianam vitam egerunt.<br><br> <br>[2] At prorsus contrarius est status illorum, qui in mundo in malo vixerunt, et quibus nulla conscientia, et inde negaverunt Divinum; nam omnes qui in malo vivunt, interius in se negant Divinum, utcunque cum in externis sunt putant se non negare sed agnoscere, nam agnoscere Divinum ac male vivere, opposita sunt. Qui tales sunt, apparent in altera vita, cum in statum interiorum suorum veniunt, cum audiuntur loqui et spectantur agere, sicut fatui nam a suis cupiditatibus malis erumpunt in nefaria, in contemptus aliorum, in subsannationes et blasphemias, in odia, in vindictas, machinantur dolos, quidam eorum tali astutia et malitia, ut vix credi possit ut similis fuerit intus in aliquo homine: sunt enim tunc in statu libero agendi secundum voluntatis eorum cogitata, quia separati ab exterioribus, quae illos in mundo coercuerunt et refrenarunt: verbo, sunt rationalitate orbati, quia rationale in mundo non resederat <sup>1</sup>in interioribus eorum, sed in exterioribus: at usque tunc apparent sibi ipsis sapientes prae aliis.<br><br> <br>[3] Quia tales sunt, ideo cum in secundo hoc statu sunt, remittuntur per breves vices in statum exteriorum suorum, et tunc in memoriam actorum suorum, cum fuerunt in statu interiorum.
