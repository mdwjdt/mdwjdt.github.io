<h3 align="center" class="ired">《天堂与地狱》 第185节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>185、我见过天堂的宫殿，它们金碧辉煌，难以言表。宫殿的上面闪闪发光，仿佛由纯金做的，下面则仿佛是由宝石建成的。有些宫殿更加壮丽。里面也一样，无论是言语还是学识都无法形容房间里精美的装饰。朝南的一面是花园，那里的一切同样发光，到处是闪闪发亮的叶子，仿佛银子做的，果实仿佛由金子做的；花坛里的鲜花色彩缤纷，宛如彩虹。极目远眺，可见其它的宫殿。这就是天堂的建筑，你会说艺术的本质就在那里，这也不足为奇，因为艺术本身就来自天堂。天使说，这些和其它无数更完美的事物都被主呈现在他们眼前。然而，这些事物更多地愉悦他们的心智而不是他们的眼目，因为他们在每一个细节上看到对应，并通过对应看见神性之所在。</p>

<p>185. 我见过天堂的宫殿, 它们金碧辉煌, 以至于无法描述. 其上层建筑闪闪发光, 仿佛由精金筑成, 其下层建筑仿佛由宝石筑成; 有些宫殿比其它的更壮丽. 里面也一样. 房间装饰得如此漂亮, 以致无论言语, 艺术, 抑或科学都不足以形容它们. 朝南的一面是花园, 那里的一切事物同样发光, 有些地方的叶子闪闪发光, 仿佛由银制成, 果实仿佛由金制的; 而花坛里的鲜花则用自己的颜色形成彩虹. 极目之处还有其它装裱这一景象的宫殿. 天堂的建筑便是这样, 以致你可称其为艺术的精华; 这不足为奇, 因为艺术本身就出自天堂. 天使告诉我, 这类事物和其它无数更完美的事物都被主呈现在他们眼前; 然而, 这些事物更多地愉悦他们的心灵, 而不是他们的眼目, 因为他们在细节中看到对应, 并通过对应看见神性之物. </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>185. 在天國, 我見過金碧輝煌的宮殿, 非言語所能形容。上面諸層閃耀著光芒, 仿佛由精金築成, 下面諸層仿佛由寶石築成。每個宮殿都美侖美奐, 一個比一個漂亮。裡面同樣壯觀, 每個房間都裝飾得極其精美, 非言語所能形容, 也非藝術科技所能描繪。向南的一面是花園, 到處閃閃發光, 葉子似銀, 果實如金, 五顏六色的花朵形成美麗的彩虹。極目之處, 也有宮殿映入眼簾。天國的建築如此壯美, 可稱為藝術的精髓。這不奇怪, 因為藝術本是從天上來的。天人告訴我, 除此之外, 主還將無數更完美的景象呈現在他們眼前, 不僅悅目, 更能怡神。因為他們透過美景看到對應, 又透過對應看見上帝的本質。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #185 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>185. I have seen palaces in heaven that were so splendid as to be beyond description. Their upper stories shone as though they were made of pure gold, and their lower ones as though they were made of precious gems. Each palace seemed more splendid than the last. It was the same inside. The rooms were graced with such lovely adornments that neither words nor the arts and sciences are adequate to describe them. On the side that faced south there were parklands where everything sparkled in the same way, here and there the leaves like silver and the fruits like gold, with the flowers in their beds making virtual rainbows with their colors. On the horizon of sight there were other palaces that framed the scene. The architecture of heaven is like this, so that you might call it the very essence of the art - and small wonder, since the art itself does come to us from heaven. <br><br>Angels tell me that things like this and countless others even more perfect are presented to their view by the Lord; but that such sights actually delight their minds more than their eyes because they see correspondences in the details, and through their correspondences they see things divine. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #185 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p> 185. I have seen the palaces of heaven which were so magnificent that they cannot be described. Above, they glittered as if made of pure gold, and below, as if made of precious stones. Some were more splendid than others. It was the same within. Neither words nor, knowledge are adequate to describe the decorations that adorned the rooms. On the side looking to the south there were parks where, too, everything shone, in some places the leaves glistening as if made of silver, and the fruit as if made of gold, while the flowers in their beds formed as it were rainbows with their colours. Beyond the boundaries where the view terminated were seen other palaces. Such is the architecture of heaven that you would say that there the art is in its very essence, and no wonder, because the art itself is from heaven. The angels said that such things and innumerable others still more perfect are set forth before their eyes by the Lord. Yet they said that these things are more pleasing to their minds than to their eyes, because in every one of them they see correspondences, and through the correspondences, things Divine. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #185 (Ager, 1900)</h4><p>185. I have seen palaces in heaven of such magnificence as cannot be described. Above they glittered as if made of pure gold, and below as if made of precious stones, some more splendid than others. It was the same within. Both words and knowledge are inadequate to describe the decorations that adorned the rooms. On the side looking to the south there were parks, where, too, everything shone, in some places the leaves glistening as if made of silver, and fruit as if made of gold; while the flowers in their beds formed rainbows with their colors. Beyond the borders, where the view terminated, were seen other palaces. Such is the architecture of heaven that you would say that art there is in its art; and no wonder, because the art itself is from heaven. The angels said that such things and innumerable others still more perfect are presented before their eyes by the Lord; and yet these things are more pleasing to their minds than to their eyes, because in everyone of them they see a correspondence, and through the correspondences what is Divine. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #185 (original Latin)</h4><p>185. Visa sunt palatia caeli, quae tam magnifica erant, ut non describi possint. Supra fulgebant sicut forent ex puro auro, ac infra sicut ex lapidibus pretiosis; unum palatium splendidius quam alterum: intus similiter; conclavia erant ornata decoramentis talibus, ut illis describendis non voces nec scientiae sufficiant. Ad latus, quod spectabat meridiem, paradisi erant, ubi omnia similiter coruscabant, et quibusdam in locis folia sicut ex argento, et fructus sicut ex auro et flores in suis areis per colores sistebant quasi irides ad fines iterum palatia visa sunt, in quae terminabantur aspectus. Talia sunt architectonica caeli, ut dicas ibi artem in sua arte esse; nec mirum, quia ipsa illa ars e caelo est. Dicebant angeli, quod talia, et innumerabilia plura. quae adhuc perfectiora sunt, sistantur a Domino coram oculis eorum sed usque quod illa plus mentes eorum quam oculos oblectent, et hoc quia in singulis vident correspondentias, et per correspondentias Divina. </p>
