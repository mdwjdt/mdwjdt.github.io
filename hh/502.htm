<h4 align="center"></h4><p>502、一旦第一个状态（前一章所描述的外层状态）结束后，灵人就被引入内层状态，或者说被引入其内层意志和由此而来的思想的状态，也就是他在世上一人独处时毫无约束、自由思想的状态。他不知不觉就滑入这种状态，就像他在世上将最接近其言语的思想、也就是其言语的直接源头撤回朝向他的内层思想并安住其中一样。因此，在内层的这种状态中，灵人是在自己里面，在他真正的生命中，因为出于自己的情感自由地思考，才是人真正的生命，是人自己。</p>
<p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>502. 一旦第一个状态, 就是前一章所描述的外层状态结束, 作为灵的人就被引入内层状态, 或被引入其内层意愿和由此而来的思维的状态, 人在世独自一人自由思想, 毫无约束时便处于这种状态. 他不知不觉就滑入这种状态, 正如他在世上将最接近其言语的思维, 就是其言语的直接源头撤回到内层思维, 使它停留在后者当中时所行的那样. 所以, 在其内层的这种状态下, 作为灵的人便在自己里面, 并活出其真实的生命, 因为出于自己的情感自由思考, 才是人的真生命, 是真正的人自己. </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>502. 第一個狀態(上一章所描述的外在層面的狀態)結束以後, 人就進入內在層面的狀態。該狀態正是人獨處, 自由思想, 不受約束時所進入的內在意志和思想的狀態。人成為靈, 進入第二個狀態以後, 他就成了真正的自己, 開始過真正屬於自己的生活, 因為照自己的情感自由地思想正是人的生命和自我所在。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #502 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>502. Once the first state has been completed - the state of more outward concerns described in the preceding chapter - we as spirits are brought into the state of our deeper concerns, or into the state of those deeper intentions and consequent thoughts we engaged in when we were left to ourselves in this world and our thinking was free and unfettered. We slip into this state without realizing it much as we did in the world when we drew the thought nearest to our speech, the immediate source of our speech, back toward our inner thought, and let it pause there a while. So when we as spirits are in this state, we are being ourselves and living our real life, since thinking freely from our own affection is our very life and our very self. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #502 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p>502. When the first state, which is the state of the exteriors treated of in the preceding section, has been passed through, the man-spirit is let into the state of his interiors, or into the state of his interior will and the thought therefrom, in which he had been in the world when left to himself to think freely and without restraint. Into this state he unconsciously glides, just as when in the world he withdraws the thought nearest to his speech, that is, from which he speaks, towards his interior thought and abides in the latter. Therefore, in this state of his interiors the man-spirit is in himself and in his very life; for to think freely from his own affection is the very life of man, and is himself. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #502 (Ager, 1900)</h4><p>502. When the first state, which is the state of the exteriors treated of in the preceding chapter, has been passed through, the man-spirit is let into the state of his interiors, or into the state of his interior will and its thought, in which he had been in the world when left to himself to think freely and without restraint. Into this state he unconsciously glides, just as when in the world he withdraws the thought nearest to his speech, that is, from which he speaks, towards his interior thought and abides in the latter. Therefore in this state of his interiors the man-spirit is in himself and in his very life; for to think freely from his own affection is the very life of man, and is himself. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #502 (original Latin)</h4><p>502. Post primum statum exactum, qui est status exteriorum, de quo in praecedente articulo actum est, homo spiritus immittitur in statum interiorum suorum, seu in statum interioris voluntatis et inde cogitationis, in quo fuerat in mundo, cum sibi relictus libere et absque freno cogitavit; in hunc statum illabitur ipso nesciente, similiter ut in mundo, cum retrahit cogitationem proximam loquelae, seu ex qua loquela, versus interiorem, ac in ea moratur. Quare cum homo spiritus in hoc statu est, in se ipso est, et in ipsa sua vita; nam libere cogitare ex propria affectione, est ipsa vita hominis, et est ipse. </p>
