<h3 align="center" class="ired">《天堂与地狱》 第244节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>244、前面说了，天堂里所有天使都说一种语言，但还是有如下的分别：智慧者的言语更内在，情感和思想意念更富于变化；智慧稍逊者的言语则外在，不太丰富；平庸者的言语还要更外在，由词语构成，收集其意思的方式与世人彼此说话时一样。还有一种面部表情语言，它能转换为用意念修改的声音；此外，还有一种语言，由属天的代表形象与意念相混杂，并从这些意念呈现为视觉；还有一种身体姿态语言，它对应情感，并表现出诸如话语中所表达的那类事物；还有一种通过情感的一般事物和思想的一般事物来表达的语言，还有一种像雷鸣一样的语言，以及其它类型的语言。</p>
<p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>244. 如前所述, 在天堂, 所有人都拥有一种语言; 但它在这方面是有变化的, 即: 智慧人的言语更内在, 更富有情感和思维观念的变化; 而不太智慧之人的言语则更外在, 不太丰富; 简单人的言语还要外在, 实际上由话语构成, 意义就从这些话语以世人彼此交谈时的方式被汇集起来. 还有一种面部表情言语, 它能切换到由观念所调节的某种有声物. 此外, 有一种天堂的代表与观念混杂于其中的言语, 这些观念能呈现给视觉. 有一种言语通过对应于情感, 并表现诸如由他们的话语所表达的那类事物的身体举止来表达. 还有一种共享情感和共享思维的言语. 又有一种雷鸣般的言语; 以及其它言语. </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>244. 前面說了, 天國所有的人說同一種語言, 但它還是有所分別的, 就是說, 智慧較高的天人, 其語言更為深奧, 蘊藏的情感更為微妙, 表達的觀念也更為具體。智慧較低的天人, 其語言沒那麼深奧, 也沒那麼豐富。智慧平平的天人, 其語言更為淺顯, 遣詞表意的方式和世人差不多。<br><br>此外, 還有表情化為聲音, 由意念調節的語言;有天國的形像與意念結合, 使意念成為可見的語言;有用肢體動作表達情感, 如用言語表達的語言;有相通的情感和相通的思想所發出的語言;有雷鳴般的語言, 等等。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #244 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>244. There is, as already noted, a single language for everyone in heaven; but it does vary, in that the language of wiser people is more profound and more full of shades of affections and specific concepts. The language of less wise individuals is less profound and not so full, and the language of simple people is still less profound, actually consisting of words that yield meaning only the way they do when we on earth talk with each other. <br><br>There is also a language of facial expressions that switch over to a sound modified by ideas, and a language in which images of heaven are combined with concepts and the concepts are presented visually. There is also a language of bodily movements responsive to affections and portraying the same things that their verbal expressions do. There is a language of shared affections and of shared thoughts; there is a thunderous language; and there are other languages as well. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #244 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p> 244. In heaven, as has been said above, all have one speech; but it is varied in this respect, that the speech of the wise is more interior and more full of variations of affections and ideas of thought, while the speech of the less wise is more exterior and lacking in such fullness, and the speech of the simple is still more exterior, consisting of words from which the meaning is to be gathered in the same way as when men are talking with one another. There is also speech by the face, terminating in something sonorous modified by ideas. Again, there is speech in which heavenly representatives are mingled with ideas, and go forth from ideas to sight. There is also speech by gestures that correspond to affections, and represent things like those expressed by their words. There is speech by means of the general things of affections and the general things of thoughts. There is speech like thunder, besides other kinds. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #244 (Ager, 1900)</h4><p>244. In heaven, as has been said above, all have one speech; but it is varied in this respect, that the speech of the wise is more interior and more full of variations of affections and ideas of thought, while the speech of the less wise is more external and less full; and the speech of the simple is still more external, consisting of words from which the meaning is to be gathered in the same way as when men are talking to one another.

<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #244 (original Latin)</h4><p>244. Loquela est una omnibus in caelo, ut supra dictum est sed illa variatur in eo, quod loquela sapientium interior sit, ac plenior affectionum variationibus et cogitationum ideis loquela minus sapientium exterior, et non cum impletione tali ac loquela simplicium adhuc exterior, et inde consistens ex vocibus, ex quibus sensus hauriendus modo quo fit cum homines inter se loquuntur. Est quoque loquela per faciem desinens in sonorum modificatum per ideas: est quoque loquela, in qua repraesentativa caeli mixta sunt ideis, et quoque ex ideis ad visum: est etiam loquela per gestus correspondentes affectionibus, et repraesentantes similia, quae illorum voces: est loquela per communia affectionum et per communia cogitationum: est loquela tonans: praeter alias. </p>
