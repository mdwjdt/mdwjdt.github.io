<h4 align="center"></h4><p>181、天使的衣服不仅仅看似衣服，而是真实的衣服。这可以从下事实来确定：天使既能看见也能触摸它们，并且他们有许多衣服，或穿上或脱下，他们护理不穿的衣服，需要的时候再穿上。我上千次看到他们穿着各种各样的衣服。当我问他们从哪里得到自己的衣服时，他们说，来自主，他们把它们作为礼物接收。有时，他们不知不觉就穿上了。他们还说，他们的衣服会按照他们状态的变化而改变：在第一和第二状态，他们的衣服是闪闪发光的和闪亮的白色；在第三和第四个状态，有点黯淡。这同样是由于对应，因为他们状态的变化是就他们的聪明和智慧而论的（如前<a href="../hh/154.htm">154</a>至<a href="../hh/161.htm">161</a>节所述）。</p>

<p>181. 天使的衣服不仅看似衣服, 而且是真实的衣服. 这一点从以下事实明显看出来: 天使既能看见也能摸到它们, 并且他们有许多衣服, 或穿上或脱下, 不穿的衣服就收起来, 需要的时候再穿上. 我上千次看到他们穿着各种不同的衣服. 当我问他们从哪里得到自己的衣服时, 他们说, 他们的衣服来自主, 并被赐给他们; 有时, 他们不知不觉就穿上衣服. 他们还说, 他们的衣服会照其状态的变化而变化: 在第一和第二个状态, 他们的衣服是闪亮的白色; 在第三和第四个状态, 就有点黯淡; 这同样是由于对应, 因为他们状态的变化与聪明和智慧有关, 如前所述(<a href="../ac/154.htm">天国的奥秘 154</a>, <a href="../ac/161.htm">161</a>节). </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>181. 天人穿著衣服, 並非看似如此, 而是實際如此, 因為不僅看得到, 也摸得到。再者, 他們有很多衣服, 有的穿在身上, 有的暫時收藏。我成千上萬次看到他們穿著不同的衣服。<br><br>我問他們衣服從何而來, 他們說是主的恩賜。有時, 他們不知不覺中就換上了衣服。他們還說, 隨著生命狀態的變化, 他們的衣服也會發生變化。在第一二個狀態下, 他們的衣服熠熠生輝, 光芒四射。在第三四個狀態下, 就沒有那麼亮麗了。這也是出於對應, 因為狀態的變化就是其聰明智慧的變化(<a href="154.htm">154-161</a>)。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #181 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>181. We can tell that angels' clothes do not merely look like clothes but really are because they not only see them, they feel them as well. Further, they have many garments that they take off and put on, and they put away the ones they are not using and put back on the ones they are. I have seen thousands of times that they wear different clothes.<br><br>I have asked them where they got their clothes, and they have told me that their clothes come from the Lord and are given to them, and that sometimes they are clothed without noticing it. They have also said that their clothes change depending on the changes of their state, that their clothes are radiant and gleaming white in their first and second state, while in the third and fourth states they are somewhat dimmer. This too is because of correspondences, because these changes of state have to do with their intelligence and wisdom, discussed above in <a href="154.htm">154-161</a>. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #181 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p> 181. That the garments of angels do not merely appear as garments but really are garments is confirmed by the fact that angels not only see them but actually feel them, that they have many garments, and that they take them off and put them on, that they care for those that are not in use, and put them on again when they need them. That they are clothed with a variety of garments I have seen a thousand times. When I asked where they got their garments, they said from the Lord, and that they receive them as gifts, and sometimes are clothed with them unconsciously. They said also that their garments are changed in accordance with their changes of state, that in the first and second state, their garments are shining and glistening white, and in the third and fourth states, a little dimmer, and this also from correspondence, because they have changes of state as to intelligence and wisdom (of which, see above <a href="154.htm">154-161</a>). </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #181 (Ager, 1900)</h4><p>181. That the garments of angels do not merely appear as garments, but are real garments, is evident from the fact that angels both see them and feel them, that they have many garments, and that they put them off and put them on, that they care for those that are not in use, and put them on again when they need them. That they are clothed with a variety of garments I have seen a thousand times. When I asked where they got their garments, they said from the Lord, and that they receive them as gifts, and sometimes they are clothed with them unconsciously. They said also that their garments are changed in accordance with their changes of state, that in the first and second state their garments are shining and glistening white, and in the third and fourth state a little less bright; and this likewise from correspondence, because their changes of state have respect to intelligence and wisdom (of which see (<a href="154.htm">Heaven and Hell 154</a><a href="154.htm">)</a> above, <a href="154.htm">154</a>, <a href="161.htm">161</a>). </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #181 (original Latin)</h4><p>181. Quod vestes angelorum non appareant sicut vestes, sed quod realiter sint vestes, constat ex eo quod illas non modo videant, sed etiam tactu sentiant tum quod vestes eis plures sint, et quod exuant et induant illas, et quae non in usu conservent, et dum in usu reassumant: quod variis induti sint vestibus, millies mihi visum est. Inquisivi unde illis vestes, et dixerunt quod a Domino, et quod donentur illis, et quod quandoque vestiantur illis nescientibus. Dixerunt etiam, quod mutentur vestes illorum, et quod illis vestes in primo et secundo statu sint splendidae et candidae, in tertio et quarto paulo obscuriores, et hoc quoque ex correspondentia quia illis mutationes status sunt quoad intelligentiam et sapientiam (de quibus videatur supra, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_181/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_154" target=_top>154-161</a>). </p>
