<h3 align="center" class="ired">《天堂与地狱》 第123节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>123、因为那在主里面并来自主的神性之爱，主在天堂显为一轮太阳，故在天堂里所有的天使都不断地转向主：属天国度的天使转向显为太阳的主，属灵国度的天使转向显为月亮的主，而地狱里的人则转向对立的黑暗和漆黑，也就是说他们背对着主，远离主。这是因为在地狱里的所有人都陷自我之爱和尘世之爱中，因而与主对立。那些转向漆黑、也就是尘世太阳所在之地的人，在地狱的后面，被称为“魔鬼”；而那些转向黑暗、也就是尘世月亮所在之地的人，在地狱的更前面，被称为“恶灵”<a href="#a184">｛注1｝</a>。这就是为什么说地狱里的人在黑暗中、天堂里的人在光明中。“黑暗”表示源于邪恶的伪谬，“光明”表示源于良善的真理。<br><br>
他们之所以如此地转动他们自己，是因为在来世，所有人都面向他们内在占统治地位的事物，也就是他们的爱。正是天使和灵人的内在构成了他们的脸，而且，灵界的方位不像尘世那样固定不变，而是由人的脸来决定。人也是如此，就其灵而言，人转动自己的方式和灵人一样，若陷入自我之爱和尘世之爱，就背对着主；若爱主爱邻舍，就朝向主。但人对此一无所知，因为他在尘世，而尘世的方位是固定的，取决于太阳的升起和落下。不过，鉴于这一点不容易被人理解，等到下文谈到天堂里的方位、空间和时间时，再作阐明。<a href="#a185">｛注2｝</a><br><br>
<a name="a182">｛注1｝</a>：【英103】在下面的第<a href="../hh/311.htm">311</a>节，瑞典伯格将“魔鬼”和“撒旦”这两个名称分别与这两个类别相关联。他经常使用“灵人”（spirits）来指那些死后正在为天堂或地狱做准备的人。【中】 “后面的地狱名为魔鬼，在那里的人被称为恶魔；在前面的地狱名为撒旦，在那里的人被称为恶灵”（下文第<a href="../hh/311.htm">311</a>节）；有英译本此处译为“spirit”，通常译为“灵人”，在强调与肉体的关系时，也译为“灵魂”、“灵”，但很显然这个词本身既包括善灵也包括恶灵，而地狱里的灵人非善类，故此处译为“恶灵”。<br><br>
<a name="a192">｛注2｝</a>：【英104】参见<a href="../hh/141.htm">141</a>-<a href="../hh/153.htm">153</a>、<a href="../hh/162.htm">162</a>-<a href="../hh/169.htm">169</a> 和<a href="../hh/191.htm">191</a>-<a href="../hh/199.htm">199</a>节。</p>

<p>123. 由于主凭在祂里面并来自祂的神性之爱如一轮太阳那样出现在天堂, 故在众天堂, 所有天使不断转向祂; 属天国度的天使转向显为太阳的主, 属灵国度的天使转向显为月亮的主. 而地狱里的人则转向对面的漆黑与幽暗, 也就是向后转, 背离主; 原因在于, 地狱里的所有人都陷入对自我和尘世的爱, 因而与主对立. 那些转向漆黑, 也就是尘世太阳所在之地的人在地狱的后面, 被称为魔鬼; 而那些转向幽暗, 也就是尘世月亮所在之地的人在地狱的前面, 被称为灵人. 这就是为何说地狱里的人陷入黑暗, 天堂里的人处于光明; “黑暗”表示源于邪恶的虚假, “光明”表示源于良善的真理. 他们之所以如此转动, 是因为在来世, 所有人都朝着在他们内层占据主导地位的事物注视, 因而注视他们的爱; 对天使和灵人来说, 正是内层构成脸. 灵界的方位不像尘世的那样固定不变, 而是由这脸来决定. 就其灵而言, 人转动的方式和灵人一样, 若陷入对自我和尘世的爱, 就背离主; 若处于对主和对邻之爱, 就转向主. 但人对此一无所知, 因为他在自然界, 而自然界的方位取决于日升日落. 不过, 鉴于这一点不容易被人理解, 等到论述方位, 空间和时间时, 我们再阐明它. </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>123. 主既以其聖仁, 在天國顯為一輪太陽, 所有天人自然就始終如一地朝向祂。仁智天國的天人朝向顯為一輪太陽的主, 義信天國的天人朝向顯為一輪月亮的主。與之相反, 地獄之靈總朝向漆黑與幽暗, 背對著主。因為地獄的人全都沉溺於對自己和世界的愛欲, 與主對立。朝向人間太陽代表漆黑的靈住在地獄的後部, 稱為"魔鬼;"朝向人間月亮所代表幽暗的靈住在地獄的前部, 稱為"撒旦"。正因如此, 地獄之靈被描述為住在黑暗之中, 天國之靈則被描述為住在光明之中。"黑暗"表示惡所生之偽,"光明"表示善所生之理。<br><br>他們如此朝向, 是因為在心靈世界, 各自朝向內在秉性中占主導的方向, 也就是朝向各自的所愛。內在的秉性造就了天人和靈的面貌。再者, 心靈世界的方位不像人間那般固定, 而是由面對的方向來確定。<br><br>我們自己在靈裡也是如此:若沉迷於愛自己與愛世界, 就背對主;若專注於愛主與愛鄰人, 我們就面對主。我們未曾意識到這些, 因為物質界的方位是由太陽的東升西落來決定的。鑒於世人難以領會這些, 我在介紹天國的時間, 空間及方位時將提供更多的例子。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #123 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>123. Since the Lord does appear in heaven as a sun because of the divine love that is in him and from him, all the people there constantly turn toward him. The inhabitants of the heavenly kingdom turn toward him as the sun, while the inhabitants of the spiritual kingdom turn toward him as the moon. In contrast, the inhabitants of hell turn toward the darkness and dimness that are on the opposite side, and therefore turn away from the Lord. This is because all the people who are in the hells are caught up in love for themselves and the world and are therefore opposed to the Lord. The ones who turn toward the darkness that stands for our world's sun are at the back of the hells and are called "demons," while the ones who turn toward the dimness that stands for our moon are in the front of hell and are called "spirits." This is why people in the hells are described as being in darkness and people in the heavens as being in light. "Darkness" means falsity arising from evil, and "light" means truth arising from good. <br><br>The reason people turn in this way is that in the other life we all look toward what rules in our deeper natures - toward our own loves, then; and these deeper natures form the faces of angels and spirits. Further, in a spiritual world the cardinal points are not fixed the way they are in a natural world. Instead, they are determined by the way people face. <br><br>We ourselves, in spirit, are also turning in the same fashion - away from the Lord if we are caught up in self-love and love of the world, and toward him if we are in a love for him and for our neighbor. We are unaware of this, though, because we are in a natural world where the cardinal points are determined by the sun's rising and setting. Since it is hard for people to grasp this, examples will be given below where we deal with the cardinal points and with space and time in heaven. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #123 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p> 123. Since the Lord appears in heaven like a Sun by reason of the Divine love which is in Him and from Him, so all in the heavens turn constantly towards Him, those in the celestial kingdom to Him as a Sun, those in the spiritual kingdom to Him as a Moon. But those in hell turn towards the dense blackness and darkness which are in the opposite direction, that is, they turn backwards, away from the Lord, the reason being that all in the hells are in the love of self and of the world, thus opposed to the Lord. Those who turn to the dense darkness, that is, in the place where this world's sun is, are in the hells behind, and are called genii; while those who turn to the darkness, that is, in the place of the moon, are in hells in front and are called spirits. This is why those in the hells are said to be in darkness, and those in the heavens in light. "Darkness" signifies falsity from evil, and "light", truth from good. They turn in that way because all in the other life look towards the things that rule in their interiors, thus to their loves, and it is the interiors that make the face of an angel or spirit. In the spiritual world, also, there are no fixed quarters, as in the natural world, but it is the face that determines them. Man also, in respect of his spirit, turns in the same way as a spirit does, backwards from the Lord, if he is in the love of self and of the world, and towards the Lord if he is in love to Him and the neighbour. But man does not know this, because he is in the natural world where the quarters are fixed according to the rising and setting of the sun. But, as this cannot be easily comprehended by man, it will be elucidated in subsequent sections which will treat of Quarters, Space, and Time in Heaven. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #123 (Ager, 1900)</h4><p>123. As it is from the Divine love that is in and from Him that the Lord appears in heaven like a sun, so all in the heavens are turned constantly to Him those in the celestial kingdom to Him as a sun and those in the spiritual kingdom to Him as a moon. But those that are in hell turn themselves to an opposite darkness and dense darkness, that is, they turn backwards, away from the Lord; and for the reason that all in the hells are in love of self and the world, thus antagonistic to the Lord. Those who turn themselves to the dense darkness that is in the place where this world's sun is are in the hells behind, and are called genii; while those that turn themselves to the darkness that is in the place of the moon are in the hells more in front, and are called spirits. This is why those in the hells are said to be in darkness, and those in the heavens in light, "darkness" signifying falsity from evil, and "light" truth from good. They so turn themselves because all in the other life look towards what rules in their interiors, thus to their loves; and with angels and spirits the interiors determine the face; and in the spiritual world quarters are not fixed, as in the natural world, but are determined by the face. In respect to his spirit man turns himself in like manner as a spirit does, backwards from the Lord if he is in love of self and the world, and towards the Lord if he is in love to the Lord and the neighbor. But of this man is ignorant, because he is in the natural world where quarters are determined by the rising and setting of the sun. But as this cannot be easily comprehended by men it will be elucidated hereafter when Quarters, Space, and Time in Heaven are treated of. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #123 (original Latin)</h4><p>123. Quoniam Dominus apparet in caelo ut Sol ex Divino Amore qui est in Ipso et ab Ipso, ideo etiam omnes qui in caelis sunt, vertunt se constanter ad Ipsum qui in regno caelesti ad Ipsum ut Solem, qui in regno spirituali ad Ipsum ut Lunam: illi autem, qui in inferno sunt, se vertunt ad caliginosum et tenebrosum, quae ex opposito sunt, ita retro a Domino ex causa, quia omnes qui in infernis, in amore sui et mundi sunt, ita oppositi Domino. Qui se vertunt ad caliginosum, quod loco solis mundi est, sunt in infernis a tergo, et vocantur genii; qui autem se vertunt ad tenebrosum, quod loco lunae est, sunt in infernis anterius, et vocantur spiritus inde est, quod qui in infernis sunt, dicantur esse in tenebris, et qui in caelis in luce; tenebrae" significant falsum ex malo, et "lux" verum ex bono. Quod ita se vertant, est causa, quia omnes in altera vita spectant ad illa quae regnant in interioribus eorum, ita ad suos amores, ac interiora faciunt faciem angeli et spiritus et in mundo spirituali non sunt plagae determinatae sicut in mundo naturali, sed facies est quae determinat. Homo etiam quoad spiritum suum similiter se vertit, retro a Domino qui in amore sui et mundi est, et ad Ipsum qui in amore in Ipsum et erga proximum est; sed homo id nescit, quia in mundo naturali est, ubi plagae determinantur secundum solis ortum et occasum: ast hoc, quia aegre ab homine capi potest, illustrabitur in sequentibus, ubi de Plagis, Spatio et Tempore in Caelo, agetur. </p>
