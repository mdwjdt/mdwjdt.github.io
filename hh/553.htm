<h3 align="center" class="ired">《天堂与地狱》 第553节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>553、在任何天堂之光中，地狱里的所有灵人都显出他们邪恶的样子。因为那里的每个灵人都是其邪恶的形像，因为他的内层和外层作为一个整体行事，内层本性呈现在外层中，也就是在脸面、身体、言语和行为中表现出来。因此，所有灵人的本性都一目了然。通常他们表现为如下的样子：蔑视他人，威胁不恭敬他们的人，各种仇恨和各种报复等。他们内层的凶恶和残忍通过这些样子显现出来。但是，当有人赞扬、恭敬和膜拜他们时，他们的面容就克制着，露出喜悦的表情。<br><br>
[2]无法用三言两语来描述他们所显现出来的样子，因为没有两个灵人是一样的。尽管那些处在同样的邪恶、因而在同一个地狱社群的人大体上很相像，就像衍生于同一个层面，每个人的脸都有着某种相似之处。一般来说，他们都面目狰狞，没有生气，如同僵死；有的人脸色发黑，有的炽热如炬，有的则因生疮生瘤而溃烂毁容；许多人似乎没有脸，取而代之的是某种毛发或骨状的东西，有的只见牙齿；他们的身体也是奇形怪状的，言语也是愤怒、敌意或报复之言，因为各人都出于他的伪谬说话，而语气则出于他的邪恶。总之，他们都是自己地狱的形像。<br><br>
[3]我没有被允许看到地狱本身在总体上是什么形状，只是被告知，正如整个天堂作为一个整体就像一个人一样（参看第<a href="../hh/59.htm">59</a>-<a href="../hh/67.htm">67</a>节），地狱作为一个整体则像一个魔鬼，可能呈现为一个魔鬼的形像（参看第<a href="../hh/544.htm">544</a>节）。然而，我经常被允许看到特定的地狱或地狱社群的形状，因为在它们的入口处，也就是所谓的“地狱之门”，通常会出现一个怪物，它代表了里面灵人的普遍形像，同时，里面居民的凶暴的激情也以恐怖丑陋的方式表现出来，对此，我不忍提及。<br><br>
[4]但应该知道，虽然在天堂之光中地狱的灵人看上去是这个样子，但他们自己彼此看上去像是人。这是出于主的怜悯，免得他们彼此相见像在天使面前一样可憎。然而，这种外表只是假象，因为只要一丝天堂之光进入，他们的人模人样就变成了丑陋的模样，正如他们自身的本来面目（正如刚才所描述的），因为在天堂之光中，一切都原形毕露。他们也因此逃避天堂之光，投身在自己的光中，这光像是燃烧的煤发出的光，有时又像是燃烧的硫磺发出的光，但如果有一丝天堂之光流入，这光就会变成了漆黑一片。这就是为什么说地狱在漆黑和黑暗中，为什么用“漆黑”和“黑暗”表示源于邪恶的伪谬，诸如在地狱中的伪谬。</p>
<p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>553. 当在天堂之光中被看到时, 所有地狱灵都以其邪恶的形式显现. 事实上, 那里的每个人都是其邪恶的形像, 因为他的内层和外层行如一体, 内层使自己在外层, 也就是在脸, 身体, 言语和行为中显为可见. 因此, 一看见灵人, 人就能知道他们的本性. 一般来说, 他们是蔑视他人, 威胁不恭敬他们的人之形式; 是各种仇恨和各种报复的形式. 凶猛和残忍便通过这些形式从他们的内层显现出来. 但当得到他人的赞扬, 恭敬和崇拜时, 他们的面容就缓和下来, 并且看上去很高兴, 满意.<br><br>以三言两语描述所有这些形式如何显现是不可能的, 因为没有哪两个人是一样的, 尽管那些陷入相同邪恶, 因而住在同一地狱社群的人大体上很相像; 所有人的脸都出于这种相像, 如同出于一个衍生的层面那样看上去具有某种相似性. 一般来说, 他们的脸都狰狞可怖, 没有生气, 如同死尸. 其中有的发黑; 有的发红, 就像小火把; 有的因粉刺, 疣和溃疡而毁损; 有的似乎没有脸, 取而代之的是某种毛发或骨状物; 有的只看见牙齿; 他们的身体也是扭曲变形, 其言语似乎透着愤怒, 或仇恨, 或报复; 因为每个人所说的话都出自他的虚假, 而他的语气则出自他的邪恶. 一言以蔽之, 他们都是其地狱的形像.<br><br>我未被允许观看地狱总体上是什么形式, 只是被告知, 正如作为一个实体的整个天堂类似一个人(参看<a href="59.htm">59-67</a>节), 作为一个实体的整个地狱则类似一个魔鬼, 显现为一个魔鬼的形像(参看<a href="544.htm">544</a>节). 然而, 我经常看到具体的地狱或地狱社群是什么形式, 因为在它们的入口处, 就是所谓的“地狱之门”经常出现一个怪物, 它以一种总体的方式代表了住在那里的人之形式. 那时, 这些居民的残暴以我不忍提及的可怕, 恐怖来代表.<br><br>不过, 必须知道的是, 地狱灵虽在天堂之光中看上去是这样子, 但在彼此看来却是人. 这是出于主的怜悯, 免得他们在彼此眼里显得可憎, 如在天使眼中那样. 然而, 这种表象是假的, 因为天堂的光线一得以进入, 这些人的形式就变成怪物的形式; 它们本质上就是刚才所描述的形式, 因为在天堂之光中, 一切事物都会显出它们的本来面目. 这也是为何他们躲避天堂之光, 投入自己的光; 这光就像燃煤之光, 有时像燃烧的硫磺发出的光. 但凡有一丝天堂之光流入, 这光就会变成纯粹的黑暗. 这就是为何地狱被描述为在幽暗, 漆黑中, 又为何“幽暗”和“漆黑”表示诸如地狱中的那种源于邪恶的虚假. </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>553. 在天國的光照下, 所有地獄之靈都顯出他們邪惡的形相。事實上, 地獄裡的每個靈都是其惡的形相。因為他們的外表和心靈協作如一, 心靈通過面孔, 身體, 言語, 行為表現出來。所以, 看他們的外表, 就能瞭解他們的秉性。籠統而言, 他們是蔑視, 恐嚇, 仇恨, 報復的形相, 殘暴和冷酷從裡面透現出來。不過, 當他們受到讚揚, 恭敬, 崇拜時, 其面貌會有所緩和, 露出喜悅滿意之色。<br><br>要三言兩語描述他們全部的形相是不可能的, 因為沒有兩個人是完全一樣的。但是, 陷入相同罪惡, 住在同一地獄社群的人, 其面貌大體相似。籠統而言, 他們的面目皆猙獰恐怖, 沒有生氣, 如同死屍。有的發黑, 有的發紅(如火把), 有的流膿生瘡, 有的甚至無臉面, 只見頭髮或骨頭, 有的只見牙齒。他們的身體奇形怪狀, 語言帶著憤怒, 仇恨, 報復。因為他們的言詞出自謬見, 語氣出自惡欲。一言以蔽之, 他們全是地獄之相。<br><br>我未曾被允許觀看地獄在整體上的形相, 我只是被告知, 正如整個天國呈現一個人的形狀, 整個地獄也呈現一個魔鬼的形狀。不過, 我常得以看見某個地獄或某個地獄社群的形相, 因為在稱為"地獄之門"的各入口處, 通常都有一個怪物, 該怪物在總體上顯示出當中所有靈的形相, 它的猙獰可怖也刻畫出當中所有人的殘暴之性。關於這些, 我不忍稱述。<br><br>我們當知, 地獄之靈在天國之光中雖顯得如此, 他們在彼此眼中卻是人模人樣的。這是出於主的憐憫, 免得他們彼此厭惡, 如在天人眼中那樣。不過這只是一種假相, 因為當天國之光透入時, 人的模樣就變成怪物的模樣, 正如前面所描述的。這是他們真實的模樣, 因為在天國的光明中, 一切都顯出它真實的本相。這也是他們逃避天國之光, 啟入洞穴的原因。洞中的光線好像燒著的炭火或硫磺, 當有一絲天國之光透入時, 其中的光就變成一片黑暗。正因如此, 地獄被稱為漆黑幽暗之所;"漆黑""幽暗"象徵了地獄中由邪惡所生的謬誤。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #553 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>553. Seen in any of heaven's light, all the spirits in the hells appear in the form of their own evil. Each one is in fact an image of her or his evil, since for each individual the inner and outer natures are acting as a unit, with the deeper elements presenting themselves to view in the outer ones - in the face, the body, the speech, and the behavior. So you can tell what they are like by looking at them. In general, they are forms of contempt for others, threats against people who do not revere them; they are forms of various shadings of hatred, of various forms of vengefulness. Savagery and cruelty show through from within. When others praise them, though, or revere and worship them, their faces compose themselves and look almost happy and gratified.<p> </p><p>[2] There is no way to describe briefly all the ways these forms look, since no one is just like any other. There is only a general likeness among people who are absorbed in similar evils and are therefore in the same hellish community, a similarity that acts like a common background that gives the individual faces a kind of overall resemblance. In general, their faces are frightful, as lifeless as corpses. Some of their faces are black, some like little torches, some pimply, with huge ulcerated sores. In many cases there is no visible face, only something hairy or bony in its place, while with others only the teeth show. Their bodies are equally misshapen, and their speech seems to embody wrath or hatred or vengeance, since all their articulation comes from their false perception and all the tone comes from their evil intent. In a word, they are all images of their hell.<p> </p><p>[3] I have not been allowed to see what form hell itself is in overall. I have only been told that in the same way that all heaven as a single entity resembles a single human being (<a href="59.htm">59-67</a>), so all hell as a single entity resembles a single devil and can be manifested as a likeness of a single devil (see above, <a href="544.htm">544</a>). However, I have often seen what form particular hells or hellish communities have, since at their entrances (which are called the gates of hell), there often appears a monstrous figure that in a general way represents the form of the people who live there. The savagery of these inhabitants is then imaged by frightful horrors that I forbear to mention.<p> </p><p>[4] It does need to be known, though, that hellish spirits look like this in heaven's light, but that they look human to each other. This is a gift of the Lord's mercy, so that they do not look as repulsive to each other as they do to angels. However, this appearance is deceiving, since the moment a ray of light from heaven is let in, these human forms turn into the monstrous ones that they are essentially, the forms just described, because in heaven's light everything appears as it really is. This is also why they avoid heaven's light and dive into their own illumination, an illumination like that of glowing coals or, in places, like burning sulfur. This light, though, turns into pure darkness when any ray of light from heaven flows in. This is why the hells are described as being in gloom and darkness, and why the gloom and darkness mean the kinds of malevolent distortions characteristic of hell. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #553 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p>553. All spirits in the hells, when seen in any light of heaven, appear in the form of their evil; for with each one there is an image of his evil, for with everyone his interiors and his exteriors act as a one, the interiors making themselves visible in the exteriors, which are the face, body, speech and movements; thus the characters of all spirits are recognized on sight. In general, they are forms of contempt of others and of menaces against those who do not pay them respect; they are forms of hatreds of various kinds, also of various kinds of revenge. Fierceness and cruelty from their interiors show through these forms. But when others commend, venerate, and worship them, their faces are restrained and take on an expression of gladness from delight. <p> </p><p>[2] It is impossible to describe in a few words how all these forms appear, for no one is like another, although there is a general likeness among those who are in the same evil, and thus in the same infernal society, from which, as from a plane of derivation, the faces of the individuals there are seen to have a certain resemblance. In general, their faces are hideous, and void of life like those of corpses; the faces of some are black, others fiery like torches, others disfigured with pimples, warts, and ulcers; many seem to have no face, but in its stead something hairy or bony; and with some only the teeth are seen; their bodies also are monstrous; and their speech is like the speech of anger, hatred, or revenge; for each speaks from his falsity, while his tone is from his evil. In a word, they are all images of their own hell. <p> </p><p>[3] I have not been permitted to see what the form of hell itself in general is; I have only been told that, as the entire heaven in one complex resembles a single man (<a href="59.htm">59-67</a>), so the entire hell in one complex resembles one devil, and might be exhibited in an image of one devil (see above, <a href="544.htm">544</a>). But the forms of particular hells or infernal societies I have often been permitted to see; for at their entrances, which are called the gates of hell, there commonly appears a monster that represents in a general way the form of those within. The fierce passions of those who dwell there are represented at the same time in horrible and hideous ways that I forbear to describe. <p> </p><p>[4] But it ought to be known that this is the way infernal spirits appear in the light of heaven, while among themselves they appear as men. This is of the Lord's mercy, that they may not appear as loathsome to one another as they appear before the angels. But this appearance is a fallacy, for as soon as any ray of light from heaven is let in, their human forms appear changed into monstrous forms, such as they are in themselves (as has been described above). For in the light of heaven everything appears as it is in itself. For this reason they shun the light of heaven and cast themselves down into their own light, which is like that from lighted coals, and in some cases like that from burning sulphur; but this light also is turned from mere thick darkness when any light from heaven flows in upon it. This is why the hells are said to be in thick darkness and in darkness; and why "thick darkness" and "darkness" signify falsities derived from evil, such as are in hell. </p><p align="center">------------</p>

<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #553 (original Latin)</h4><p>553. Omnes spiritus in infernis, inspecti in aliqua luce caeli, apparent in forma sui mali est enim quisque effigies sui mali, nam apud unumquemvis interiora et exteriora unum agunt, ac interiora se sistunt videnda in exterioribus, quae sunt facies, corpus, loquela, et gustus; ita ad conspectum agniti sunt quales sunt. In genere sunt formae contemptus aliorum, minarum contra illos qui se non venerantur: sunt formae odiorum varii generis sunt formae vindictarum etiam varii generis; saevitiae et crudelitates ex interioribus per illas transparent: at cum alii illos laudant, venerantur, et colunt, contrahitur facies eorum, et apparet sicut laetum ex jucundo.<br><br> <br>[2] Omnes formae illae, quales apparent, non paucis describi potest, non enim una est similis alteri; modo inter illos, qui in simili malo sunt, et inde in simili societate infernali, est similitudo communis, ex qua sicut ex plano derivationis apparent facies singulorum ibi in quadam similitudine. In genere sunt facies eorum dirae, et expertes vitae sicut cadaverum: quorundam sunt nigrae; quorundam instar facularum igneae; quorundam ex pustulis, varicis et ulceribus enormes; apud plures non apparent facies, sed loco illius hirsutum quid, aut osseum; apud quosdam modo exstant dentes; corpora eorum etiam monstrosa sunt; et loquela eorum sicut ex ira, aut ex odio, aut ex vindicta, nam quisque loquitur ex suo falso, et sonat ex suo malo: verbo, sunt omnes sui inferni imagines.<br><br> <br>[3] Ipsum infernum in communi in qua forma est, non datum est videre; dictum modo est, quod sicut universum caelum in uno complexu referat unum Hominem (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_553/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_59" target=_top>59-67</a>), ita universum infernum in uno complexu referat unum diabolum, et quoque quod sisti possit in unius diaboli effigie (videatur supra, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_553/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_544" target=_top>544</a>). Sed in quali forma sunt inferna in specie, seu infernales societates, saepius videre datum est, nam ad aperturas illorum, quae vocantur portae inferni, utplurimum apparet monstrum, quod in communi repraesentat formam illorum qui ibi sunt: saevitiae eorum, qui ibi sunt, etiam simul tunc repraesentantur per dira et atrocia, quae memorare supersedetur.<br><br> <br>[4] At sciendum est, quod spiritus infernales appareant tales in luce caeli, sed inter se sicut homines; hoc ex misericordia Domini, ne inter se etiam foeditates sint, sicut apparent coram angelis: sed apparentia illa est fallacia, nam utprimum aliquid luci se caelo immittitur, humanae illorum formae vertuntur in monstrosas, quales in se sunt, de quibus supra; nam in luce caeli apparet omne sicut in se est. Inde quoque est, quod lucem caeli fugiant, et in suum lumen se dejiciant, quod lumen est sicut lumen ex ignitis carbonibus, et alicubi sicut ex sulphure ardente sed etiam hoc lumen vertitur in meram caliginem, cum illuc e caelo aliquid lucis influit. Inde est, quod inferna dicantur in caligine et tenebris esse et quod "caligo et tenebrae" significent falsa ex malo, qualia sunt in inferno. </p>
