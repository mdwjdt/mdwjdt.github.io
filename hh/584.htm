<h3 align="center" class="ired">《天堂与地狱》 第584节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>584、地狱到处都是，有的在大山、丘陵和岩石的下面，有的在平原和山谷的下面。通向大山、丘陵和岩石下面的地狱之门或开口，乍一看就像岩石上的洞穴和裂缝，有的很开阔，有的很狭窄，很多都凹凸不平，当往里面看时，都显得又黑又暗，但在里面的地狱灵却处在好像是燃烧的煤炭发出的火光中。他们的眼睛适合接受这种光，因为他们活在世上时因否认神性真理而对其一无所知，陷入浓密的黑暗；而且，由于他们肯定伪谬，所以处在某种伪谬之光中，他们视力就这样形成了。由于同样的原因，天堂之光对他们来说就是漆黑一片，因此，他们一旦走出洞穴，就什么也看不见。这一切都非常清楚地表明，人在多大的程度上承认上帝、建立自己与天堂和教会事物的联系，他就在多大的程度上进入天堂之光中；他在多大的程度上否认上帝、建立自己与那些违背天堂和教会事物的联系，他就会在多大的程度上进入地狱的黑暗中。</p>
<p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>584. 地狱无处不在, 既在大山, 小山和悬崖峭壁之下, 也在平原和山谷之下. 地狱的开口或门户在大山, 小山和悬崖峭壁之下, 乍一看就像岩石的洞穴和裂缝; 其中有的很开阔, 有的很狭窄, 大多崎岖不平. 往里看时, 它们似乎都漆黑, 幽暗; 但住在那里的地狱灵却有一种如从炭火发出的光照. 他们的眼睛就适合接受这光, 因为他们活在世上时便由于否认神性真理而在神性真理方面陷入黑暗, 由于肯定虚假而在虚假方面陷入一种光. 其视力便以这种方式而被如此形成. 由于同样的原因, 天堂之光对他们来说就是黑暗; 因此, 他们一旦走出洞穴, 就什么也看不见了. 这一切充分表明, 人只有承认神性, 在自己里面确立天堂与教会的价值观, 才能进入天堂之光; 他若否认神性, 在自己里面确立违反天堂与教会真理的价值观, 就会进入地狱的幽暗. </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>584. 地獄散落於各處, 有的在高山, 小山, 峭壁之下, 有的在平原, 山谷之下。高山, 小山, 峭壁之下的地獄, 其入口看似岩石間的洞穴或裂縫。有的很開闊, 有的很狹窄, 到處高低不平。一眼望去, 裡面盡是一片幽暗。但是, 對於裡面的地獄之靈來說, 其中的光線好像閃爍的炭火。他們的眼睛適合接收這種光線, 因為在世之時, 他們因否認聖理而對真理一無所見。謬見已使得他們的眼睛適合接收謬見之光。這也是天國之光在他們看來是一片漆黑的原因。當他們走出洞穴時, 什麼也看不見。這充分說明, 人若承認上帝, 從心裡確立了天國和教會的價啟體系, 那麼他就能進入天國之光。反之, 人若否認上帝, 從心裡確立了與天國和教會全然相反的價啟體系, 那麼他必要進入地獄的幽暗。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #584 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>584. There are hells everywhere. They are under the mountains and hills and cliffs and under the plains and valleys. The openings or gates to the hells that are under the mountains and hills and cliffs look at first sight like crevices or fissures in the rocks. Some of them are quite broad and open, some narrow and confined, full of rough places. All of them seem dim and gloomy when you look in, although the hellish spirits who live there have the kind of illumination you get from glowing coals. Their eyes are adjusted to the reception of this kind of light. This is because when they were living in the world they were in darkness about divine truths owing to their denial of them. They were in a kind of light as to their false convictions because they affirmed them, which gave their eyesight the form it has. This is also why heaven's light is darkness to them, so when they come out of their caves, they cannot see anything. This makes it abundantly clear that we come into heaven's light to the extent that we have acknowledged the Divine and affirmed within ourselves the values of heaven and the church. We come into the darkness of hell to the extent that we have denied the Divine and affirmed within ourselves values contrary to those of heaven and the church. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #584 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p> 584. The hells are everywhere, both under the mountains, hills, and rocks, and under the plains and valleys. The openings or gates to the hells that are under the mountains, hills, and rocks, appear to the sight like holes and clefts in the rocks, some extended and wide, and some straitened and narrow, and many of them rugged. They all, when looked into, appear dark and dusky; but the infernal spirits who are in them are in such a luminosity as arises from burning coals. Their eyes are adapted to the reception of that light, and for the reason that while they lived in the world they were in thick darkness as to Divine truths, because of their denying them, and were in a sort of light as to falsities because of their affirming them. In this way did the sight of their eyes become so formed. And for the same reason, the light of heaven is thick darkness to them, and therefore when they go out of their dens they see nothing. From all these things it has been made very clearly evident that man comes into the light of heaven just to the extent that he acknowledges the Divine, and establishes with himself the things of heaven and the Church; and that he comes into the thick darkness of hell just to the extent that he denies the Divine, and establishes with himself the things that are opposed to those of heaven and the Church. </p><p align="center">------------</p>

<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #584 (original Latin)</h4><p>584. Sunt inferna ubivis, tam sub montibus, collibus et petris, quam sub planitiebus et vallibus. Aperturae seu portae ad inferna, quae sunt sub montibus, collibus, et petris, apparent ad conspectum sicut foramina et sicut fissurae rupium, quaedam protensae in latum et amplae, quaedam arctae et strictae, pleraeque scabrae; omnes, cum inspiciuntur, apparent opacae et furvae: sed infernales spiritus, qui inibi,in tali luminoso sunt, quale est ex ignitis carbonibus; isti lumini recipiendo accommodati sunt oculi illorum et hoc ex causa, quia, dum vixerunt in mundo, in caligine fuerunt quoad Divina vera, negando illa, et quasi in lumine quoad falsa, affirmando ea; unde visus oculorum illorum ita formatus est: inde quoque est, quod lux caeli illis caligo sit quare cum exeunt suis antris, nihil vident. Ex quibus clarissime patuit, quod homo tantum in lucem caeli veniat quantum agnoscit Divinum, et confirmat apud se illa quae caeli et ecclesiae sunt et quod tantum in caliginem inferni veniat, quantum negat Divinum, et confirmat apud se ea quae sunt contra illa quae caeli et ecclesiae sunt. </p>
