<h3 align="center" class="ired">《天堂与地狱》 第440节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>440、首先，出离身体是这样发生的：人被带入一种介于睡眠和清醒之间的状态，当处于这种状态时，他自己觉得似乎完全清醒了，所有的感官都是完全敏锐的，就像在身体完全清醒时一样，不仅视觉和听觉，奇妙的是，触觉也这样，而且此时比身体清醒时的任何时候都要更敏锐。在这种状态下，人能看到活生生的灵人和天使，听到他们说话，奇妙的是，还能触摸他们，而几乎没有身体的任何介入。这就是所谓“出离身体、魂游象外”、“或在身内，或在身外，都不知道”的状态。<br><br>
我曾有三四次被允许进入这种状态，好让我知道那是什么样的，也让我知道灵人和天使享有一切感觉，就人的灵而言，当人出离身体后，他也享有这些感觉。</p>
<p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>440. 第一个经历, 就是出离肉体, 乃是这样: 人被带入一个半睡半醒的状态, 当处于这种状态时, 他觉得自己是完全清醒的; 所有感官都和肉体完全清醒时一样警觉; 不仅视觉和听觉是这样, 奇妙的是, 触觉也是这样, 而且比肉体清醒时还要敏锐. 在这种状态下, 人能活生生地看见, 听见灵人和天使, 奇妙的是, 还能触摸他们, 几乎没有任何身体干扰. 这就是所谓“魂游象外”, “或在身内, 或在身外, 都不知道”的状态. 我只有三四次被允许进入这种状态, 好叫我获知它是什么样, 并被指教: 灵人和天使享有一切感觉; 就其灵而言, 当人出离肉体时, 他也享有这些感觉. </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>440. 關於前者, 也就是人的靈出離肉體, 情況是這樣:人進入睡與醒之間的狀態, 在此狀態下, 人自己覺得好像是醒著的, 所有感官都很敏銳, 和肉體醒著時一樣, 不僅有視覺, 聽覺, 奇妙的是, 還有觸覺, 而且比肉體醒著時敏銳得多。人清楚地看見靈和天人, 聽見他們說話, 甚至能觸摸他們, 就是在這樣的狀態下, 與肉體毫無干涉。"魂遊象外,""或在身內, 或在身外, 我都不知道,"所描述的就是這種狀態。<br><br>我曾三四次被引入這種狀態, 讓我有所體會, 並瞭解靈和天人也享有各種感官的事實, 出離肉體以後, 我們的靈也享有各種知覺。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #440 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>440. The first experience, being taken out of the body, is like this. We are brought into a particular state that is halfway between sleep and waking. When we are in this state, it seems exactly as though we were awake; all our senses are as alert as they are when we are fully awake physically - sight, hearing, and strange to say, touch. These senses are more perfect than they can ever be during physical wakefulness. This is the state in which people have seen spirits and angels most vividly, even hearing them and, strange to say, touching them, with hardly anything physical interfering. It is the state described as being taken out of the body and not knowing whether one is in the body or outside it. <br><br>I have been admitted to this state three or four times, simply to let me know what it was like, and also to teach me that spirits and angels enjoy all the senses and that we do too, as to our spirits, when we are taken out of the body. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #440 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p> 440. As regards the first, namely, withdrawal from the body, it happens thus. Man is brought into a certain state that is mid-way between sleeping and waking, and when in that state he seems to himself to be wide awake; all the senses are as perfectly awake as in the completest bodily wakefulness, not only the sight and the hearing, but what is wonderful, the sense of touch also, which is then more exquisite than is ever possible when the body is awake. In this state, spirits and angels have been seen to the very life, and have been heard, and what is wonderful, have been touched, with almost nothing of the body intervening. This is the state that is called being withdrawn from the body, and not knowing whether one is in the body or out of it. I have been admitted into this state only three or four times, that I might know what it is, and might know that spirits and angels enjoy every sense, and that man does also in respect of his spirit when he is withdrawn from the body. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #440 (Ager, 1900)</h4><p>440. First, as to withdrawal from the body, it happens thus. Man is brought into a certain state that is midway between sleeping and waking, and when in that state he seems to himself to be wide awake; all the senses are as perfectly awake as in the completest bodily wakefulness, not only the sight and the hearing, but what is wonderful, the sense of touch also, which is then more exquisite than is ever possible when the body is awake.

This is the state that is called being withdrawn from the body, and not knowing whether one is in the body or out of it. I have been admitted into this state only three or four times, that I might learn what it is, and might know that spirits and angels enjoy every sense, and that man does also in respect to his spirit when he is withdrawn from the body. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #440 (original Latin)</h4><p>440. Quod primum attinet, nempe abduci a corpore, hoc ita se habet: Homo perducitur in statum quendam, qui medius est inter somnum et vigiliam, in quo statu cum est, non aliter scire potest quam quod prorsus vigil sit, omnes sensus tam vigiles sunt sicut in summa corporis vigilia, tam visus quam auditus, et quod mirabile, tactus, qui tunc exquisitior est quam usquam dari potest in vigilia corporis: in quo statu etiam visi sunt spiritus et angeli prorsus ad vivum, etiam auditi, et quod mirum, tacti, et tunc fere nihil corporis intererat. Hic status est, de quo dicitur, abduci a corpore, et nescire num in corpore vel extra corpus sit. In hunc statum modo ter aut quater immissus sum, ut modo scirem qualis est, et simul quod spiritus et angeli omni sensu gaudeant etiam homo quoad spiritum quando abductus est a corpore. </p>
