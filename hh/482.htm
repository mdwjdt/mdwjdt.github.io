<h3 align="center" class="ired">《天堂与地狱》 第482节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>482、第四，人的信仰若不是出于属天之爱，就不能在人里面长久。大量的经历已经向我清楚地显明了这一点，如果我将有关的所见所闻收集起来，必能汇编成一卷书。我能证实这一点，那些脱离属天和属灵之爱、沉溺在属肉体和世俗之爱中的人，根本没有任何信仰，也没有能力拥有任何信仰。他们只有知识或一种信念<a href="#a500">｛注1｝</a>即因为某个事物能服务他们的爱欲，就相信它是真理。许多声称自己有信仰的人被带到那些真有信仰的人面前，一旦交流起来，他们便感知到自己根本没有信仰。后来他们承认，仅仅相信什么是真理、相信圣经并不是信仰，信仰是从属天的爱中热爱真理，并出于内在的情感意愿并践行真理。<br><br>
此外，他们称之为信仰的信念被展现出来，仅仅像冬天里的光，在这光中，地上的万物被霜冻包裹着，蛰伏起来，埋在雪里，因为没有热在这光中。因此，当这信念之光一触及天堂之光线，它不仅被熄灭，还变成浓密的黑暗，人在这黑暗中伸手不见五指。与此同时，他们的内在也是如此的模糊，以至于他们什么也不懂，最终因伪谬而发疯。结果就是，这种人从圣经和教会的教义所学来的、并号称是自己信仰的真理，都被夺走，取而代之的是与他们生活的邪恶相一致的一切伪谬。因为他们都沉沦于自己的爱欲和与之一致的伪谬中，随后他们仇恨、憎恶真理，因而拒绝真理，因为真理与他们所在的邪恶的伪谬相矛盾。凭借我在天堂和地狱的所有经历，我可以作证，所有那些只凭教义宣示信仰、生活却是邪恶的人，都在地狱里。我曾见过成千上万的人被投入地狱，并在《最后的审判和巴比伦的毁灭》一书中描述了他们。<br><br>
<a name="a500">｛注1｝</a>：【英274】“信念”的原文是persuasio，在瑞典伯格的著作中，它通常指伪谬的信念。</p>
<p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>482. ⑷信若非出自天堂之爱, 就不会在人里面持久. 这一点通过大量经历向我清楚显明, 以致我若将有关它的所见所闻都收集起来, 必能汇成一本书. 我能证明这一点, 即: 那些处于脱离属天和属灵之爱的物质和世俗之爱的人根本没有任何信仰, 也不可能有任何信仰. 他们只有知识或二手信仰, 仅仅因为某个事物服务于他们的爱, 便认为它是真理. 许多声称自己有信的人被带到那些真正有信的人面前; 一建立起联系, 他们便发觉自己根本没有信. 后来他们承认, 仅仅相信真理, 相信圣言并非信; 信是出于天堂之爱热爱真理, 出于内在情感意愿并行出真理. 此外, 我还被指示, 他们称之为信的二手信仰只不过像冬天的光; 在这光里, 地上的万物都蛰伏起来, 被冰封并埋在雪里, 因为这光没有热在里面. 因此, 天堂的光线一触及它, 他们的二手信仰之光不仅被熄灭, 还实实在在变成浓密的黑暗, 人们在这黑暗中甚至看不见自己. 与此同时, 他们的内层如此变暗, 以致他们什么也不明白, 最终因虚假而变得疯狂. 结果, 这种人从圣言和教会的教义所学来, 并被称为其信之真理的一切真理都被夺走; 取而代之的是, 他们充满与其生活的邪恶相一致的一切虚假. 事实上, 他们都陷入自己的爱和支持这些爱的虚假. 那时, 他们恨恶真理, 背弃并拒绝真理, 因为真理与他们所吸收的邪恶之虚假相抵触. 我可以证明, 凡出于其教义承认唯信, 生活已然邪恶的人都在地狱. 我曾看见成千上万的人被投入地狱, 并在《最后的审判和巴比伦的毁灭》这本书中描述了他们. </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>482. 人之信若非出於天國之仁, 就不在人的裡面延續, 這也是我通過大量經歷所得知的事實。我若將這方面的所見所聞全述說出來, 必能寫成一部著作。我能證實:沉迷於肉體和物質之欲且缺乏天國和物質之欲者, 根本無信可言, 也不可能有信。他們只是接受與信相關的一些知識, 或者接受一些探索真理的信念也只是因為它們于己有利。一些聲稱自己有信的人被帶到真正有信的人面前, 當交流建立之時, 他們發覺自己根本無信可言。隨後又承認單單相信真理和聖言還不是信, 信乃是出自天國之仁來熱愛真理, 憑著渴慕之情來立志和奉行真理。我還被告知, 他們擁有的那些信念就像寒冬時的光照, 彼時, 地上的萬物被蟄封於冰天雪地之中, 因為光中無熱。所以, 當天國之光照臨時, 他們的信念之光不單滅沒, 甚至變成濃重的黑暗, 使其不見自身。同時, 他們的心靈陷入黑暗之中, 以致一無所知, 最終因偽謬而變得瘋狂。<br><br>結果, 他們從聖言和教會的教導中所學得的一切真理都被清除, 與他們惡欲相合的偽謬取而代之。事實上, 他們全陷入自己的欲望和支撐其欲望的偽謬之中。彼時, 他們厭惡真理, 背對真理, 拒絕真理, 因為真理與他們所陷入的偽謬相抵觸。<br><br>根據我在天國和地獄的一切所見所聞, 我能證實:凡宣稱唯信稱義, 卻生活敗壞之人, 全在地獄。我曾見成千上萬的此類人被投入地獄, 並在最後的審判一書中作過描述。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #482 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>482. The fact that our faith does not stay with us unless it comes from a heavenly love has been brought home to me by so much experience that if I were to relate what I have seen and heard about it, it would fill a book. I can attest to this: that there is no faith whatever and there can be none for people who are engrossed in carnal and worldly love apart from heavenly and spiritual love. There is only information, or a secondhand belief that something is true because it serves their own love. Further, a number of people who thought they had had faith were introduced to people of real faith; and once communication was established they perceived that they had no faith at all. They even admitted later that simply believing the truth or the Word is not faith; but faith is loving what is true from a heavenly love and intending and doing it from a deep affection. I was also shown that the secondhand belief they called faith was only like the light of winter in which everything on earth lies dormant, bound by the ice and buried in snow because there is no warmth to the light. As a result, the moment it is touched by rays of heaven's light, the light of their secondhand faith is not only extinguished but actually becomes a dense darkness in which people cannot even see themselves. At the same time, too, their deeper reaches are so darkened that they cannot discern anything and ultimately go mad because of their false convictions. <br><br>The result is that all the truths such people have learned from the Word and from the teaching of the church are taken away from them, all the things they claimed were part of their faith, and in their place they are filled with everything false that accords with the evil of their life. They are actually all plunged into their loves and into the false notions that support them as well. Then, since truths contradict the false, malicious notions they are absorbed in, they hate the truths, turn their backs on them, and reject them. <br><br>I can bear witness from all my experiences of what happens in heaven and in hell that people who have confessed faith alone as a matter of doctrine and have engaged in evil as regards their lives are all in hell. I have seen thousands of them sent there and have described them in the booklet The Last Judgment and Babylon Destroyed. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #482 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p> 482. Unless faith is from heavenly love it does not endure in man. This has been made clear to me by so much experience that if everything I have seen and heard respecting it were collected, it would fill a volume. This I can testify, that those who are in corporeal and worldly love apart from heavenly and spiritual love have no faith whatever, and are incapable of having any; they have nothing but knowledge or a persuasion that a thing is true because it serves their love. Some of those who claimed that they had faith were brought to those who had faith, and when they communicated with them they perceived that they had no faith at all; and afterwards they confessed that merely believing what is true and believing the Word is not faith, but that faith is loving truth from heavenly love, and willing and doing it from interior affection. Moreover, they were shown that their persuasion which they called faith was merely like the light of winter, in which light, because it has no heat in it, all things on the earth are bound up in frost, become torpid, and lie buried under the snow. As soon, therefore, as the light of persuasive faith in them is touched by the rays of the light of heaven, it is not only extinguished but is turned into a dense darkness, in which no one can see himself; and at the same time their interiors are so obscured that they can understand nothing at all, and at length become insane from falsities. Consequently with such, all the truths that they have known from the Word and from the doctrine of the Church, and have called the truths of their faith, are taken away; and they imbibe in their place every falsity that is in accordance with the evil of their life. For they are all let down into their loves and into the falsities agreeing with them; and they then hate and abhor and therefore reject truths, because they are repugnant to the falsities of evil in which they are. From all my experience in what pertains to heaven and hell I can bear witness that all those who from their doctrine have professed faith alone, and whose life has been evil, are in hell. I have seen many thousands of them cast down to hell. (Respecting these see the little work on THE LAST JUDGMENT AND THE DESTRUCTION OF BABYLON.) </p><p align="center">------------</p>

<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #482 (original Latin)</h4><p>482. [(iv.)] Quod fides non maneat hominem si non ex amore caelesti sit; per tam multam experientiam mihi manifestatum est, ut si illa quae vidi et audivi de ea re, adducerentur, implerent librum. Hoc testari possum, quod prorsus nulla fides sit, nec ulla dari possit apud illos qui in amore corporeo ac mundano absque caelesti et spirituali sunt, et quod modo sit scientia, aut persuasio quod verum sit; quia servit amori suo. Adducti quoque sunt plures ex illis qui autumaverunt se in fide fuisse, ad illos qui in fide; et tunc data communicatione perceperunt, quod prorsus nulla illis fides sit: confessi etiam sunt postea, quod solum credere verum ac Verbum non sit fides, sed amare verum ex amore caelesti, ac id velle et facere ex affectione interiore. Ostensum etiam est, quod persuasio illorum, quam dixerunt fidem, esset modo sicut lux hiemis; in qua quia non est calor, in terris omnia constricta gelu torpescunt, et sub nive jacent; quapropter lux fidei persuasivae apud illos, ut primum stringitur a radiis lucis caeli, non modo exstinguitur, sed etiam fit sicut densa caligo, in qua nemo se videt; et tunc simul interiora ita obtenebrescunt, ut prorsus nihil intelligant, ac demum insaniant ex falsis. Quapropter apud tales auferuntur omnia vera, quae ex Verbo et ex doctrina ecclesiae sciverunt, et dixerunt esse suae fidei, et loco illorum imbuuntur omni falso quod concordat cum malo vitae eorum immittuntur enim omnes in amores suos, et cum illis in falsa concordantia: et tunc vera, quia repugnant falsis mali, in quibus sunt, odio habent ac aversantur, et sic rejiciunt. Hoc testari possum ex omni experientia de rebus caeli et inferni, quod qui solam fidem ex doctrina fassi sunt, et in malo quoad vitam fuerunt, omnes in inferno sint; vidi conjectos illuc ad plura millia, de quibus in opusculo De Ultimo Judicio et Babylonia destructa. </p>
