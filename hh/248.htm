<h3 align="center" class="ired">《天堂与地狱》 第248节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>248、当天使或灵人与人说话时，此人能听见，好像人与人说话一样，但只有本人听见，站在附近的人听不见。原因是天使或灵人的言语首先流入人的思想，通过内在途径进入听觉器官，因而从内部激活听觉器官。而人与人的之间的言语首先流入空气，通过外在的方式进入人的听觉器官，从外部激活听觉器官。很显然，天使或灵人与人的交谈在人里面被听见，但由于它同样激活听觉器官，所以同样听得到声音。天使或灵人的言语从里面流下来，甚至流入耳朵，这可以通过以下事实向我清楚地显明：它也流入舌头，造成轻微的颤动，但没有任何像人自己通过舌头发音说话时的那种运动。</p>

<p>248. 当天使或灵人与人交谈时, 此人便能听见, 犹如人与人交谈; 然而, 只有他本人听得见, 旁边的人却听不见. 这是因为天使或灵人的言语首先流入人的思维, 并经由一种内在途径流入他的听觉器官, 因而从内部激活听觉. 而人与人交谈时, 其言语首先流入空气, 并经由一种外在途径流入他的听觉器官, 从外部激活听觉. 由此可见, 天使或灵人与人的交谈在人里面被听见; 但由于它同样激活听觉器官, 所以这种交谈同样听得见. 天使或灵人的言语从内部流下来, 一直流入耳朵; 这一点通过以下事实向我清楚显明: 它也流入舌头, 造成轻微的颤动, 但没有任何实际动作, 如此人自己通过舌头调节说话的声音以形成话语时的情形. </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>248. 當天人或靈與人說話時, 人聽到聲音, 和人與人對話時聽到聲音一樣。但是只有他個人聽得見, 周圍的人聽不見。因為天人或靈說話, 首先是流入人的思維, 再由內在的途徑進入人的聽覺器官, 所以它是從內部啟動聽覺。而人說話, 首先是流入空氣, 再進入聽覺器官, 是從外在的途徑啟動聽覺。由此可見, 天人或靈說話, 人是從裡面聽見。但是它同樣啟動人的聽覺系統, 故同樣振振有聲。天人或靈說話, 是從內部流入人的耳朵, 該事實從它同樣流入我的舌頭, 造成輕微的顫動而清楚地顯明了出來(雖然它沒有產生詞的動作)。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #248 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>248. When angels and spirits talk with us, it sounds just as audible as when we talk with each other, but it is not audible to people who are nearby, only to ourselves. This is because the speech of an angel or spirit flows first into our thought and then by an inner route into our organ of hearing so that it activates it from within. Our speech with each other flows first into the air and comes to our organ of hearing and activates it by an outward route. We can see from this that the speech of an angel or spirit with us is heard within us, and that since it activates our hearing mechanism just as much [as our speech with each other does], it is just as audible. <br><br>The fact that the speech of an angel or spirit flows down into the ear from within has been made clear to me from the way it flowed into my tongue as well and made it tremble slightly, though not with the actual motion involved when we are articulating the sounds of speech in the formation of words. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #248 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p> 248. The speech of an angel or spirit with man is heard by him as audibly as the speech of man with man, yet by himself only, and not by others who are standing near. The reason is that the speech of an angel or spirit flows first into a man's thought, and by an inner way into his organ of hearing, and so sets it in motion from within, while the speech of man with man flows first into the air and by an outward way into his organ of hearing, and sets it in motion from without. Evidently, then, the speech of an angel or spirit with man is heard within him, and as it equally sets the organs of hearing in motion, it is equally audible. That the speech of an angel or a spirit flows down from within even into the ear has been made clear to me by the fact that it flows also into the tongue, causing a slight vibration, but not with any such motion as when the speech tone is articulated into words by the man himself by means of the tongue. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #248 (Ager, 1900)</h4><p>248. The speech of an angel or spirit with man is heard by him as audibly as the speech of man with man, yet by himself only, and not by others who stand near; and for the reason that the speech of an angel or spirit flows first into a man's thought, and by an inner way into his organ of hearing, and thus moves it from within; while the speech of man with man flows first into the air and by an outward way into his organ of hearing, and moves it from without. Evidently, then, the speech of an angel or spirit with man is heard within him; but as the organs of hearing are thus equally moved, the speech is equally audible. That the speech of an angel or a spirit flows down from within even into the ear has been made clear to me by the fact that it flows also into the tongue, causing a slight vibration, but without any such motion as when the man himself by means of the tongue forms the sound of speech into words. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #248 (original Latin)</h4><p>248. Loquela angeli aut spiritus cum homine auditur tam sonore sicut loquela hominis cum homine, verum non auditur ab aliis qui adstant, sed a solo ipso: causa est, quia loquela angeli seu spiritus influit primum in cogitationem hominis, et per viam internam in organum auditus ejus, et sic movet illud ab interiore at loquela hominis cum homine influit primum in aerem, et per viam externam in organum auditus ejus, et movet illud ab exteriore: inde patet, quod loquela angeli ac spiritus cum homine audiatur in homine; et quia movet aeque organa auditus, quod etiam aeque sonore. Quod loquela angeli et spiritus defluat usque in aurem ab interiore, patuit mihi ex eo, quod etiam influat in linguam, et illam leviter vibret, sed non cum aliqua motione, sicut cum per illam articulatur sonus loquelae in voces ab ipso homine. </p>
