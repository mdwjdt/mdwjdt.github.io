<p>109. 至于植物界的成员是如何对应的, 这从大量例子可以看出来. 例如, 小小的种子能长成树, 长出叶子, 开花, 结果, 果实中又储存了种子. 这些事依次发生, 一起存在于一个如此奇妙, 以至于无法以三言两语来描述的秩序中. 即便填满整个书卷, 仍然还有与它们的功用关系最密切的更深层次的奥秘, 这些知识是无法穷尽的. 由于这些事也来自灵界, 也就是来自人形式的天堂, 如前所示(<a href="../ac/78.htm">天国的奥秘 78-86</a>节), 所以植物界的一切细节都与诸如人里面的那类事物有某种关联, 学术界的某些学者熟知这一点. 大量经历向我清楚表明, 植物界的一切事物也是对应. 我经常在花园里观察树木, 果实, 花朵和植物, 已经发现它们在天堂的对应, 还与附近的人交谈, 并被指教这些植物来自何处, 有何特性. </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>109. 通過大量的實例, 我們能推斷植物界的成員有何對應。例如, 小小的種子能長成大樹, 布枝散葉, 開花結果, 果內又藏著核。這過程按奇妙的規律依次發生, 實在一言難盡。關於它的功用, 就算連篇累牘, 也依然有更深的奧秘為我們所不能參透。<br><br>這些奧妙既生起于心靈世界(或說天國), 而照前面(<a href="78.htm">78-86</a>)所解釋的, 天國呈現一個人的形態, 那麼植物與人類的特徵自然也有相關之處。這在學術界已成為某些學者所共認的事實。<br><br>大量經歷向我表明, 植物界的一切也含對應。當我觀察園中的樹木, 果實, 花朵, 蔬菜時, 時常意識到天國所對應的事物。彼時, 我與附近的天人交談, 明白了那些植物從何而來, 又有何特性。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #109 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>109. We can deduce how members of the vegetable kingdom correspond from a multitude of instances - for example, from the fact that tiny seeds grow into trees, beget leaves, produce flowers and then fruits in which they place another generation of seeds, and that these things happen in a sequence and emerge all together in such a wondrous design that there is no way to describe it briefly. It would take volumes, and still there would be deeper mysteries suited to their uses that our knowledge could not compass. <br><br>Because these things stem from the spiritual world or heaven, which is in a human form (as was explained in the appropriate chapter above [<a href="78.htm">78-86</a>]), it is also true that the details of that kingdom have a kind of relationship to human characteristics - a fact that is recognized by some individuals in the learned world. <br><br>It has become clear to me from a great deal of experience that everything in that kingdom is also a correspondence. Very often, when I have looked over trees and fruits and flowers and vegetables in gardens, I have become aware of corresponding things in heaven. Then I have talked with nearby people there and have learned where these plants were from and what their characteristics were. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #109 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p> 109. How the things of the Vegetable Kingdom correspond can be confirmed from many instances. For example, little seeds grow into trees, put forth leaves, produce flowers and then fruit, in which again they deposit seeds. These things take place in succession and exist together in an order so wonderful as to be indescribable in a few words. Volumes might be filled and yet there would be still deeper arcana, relating more closely to their uses, which knowledge would be unable to exhaust. Since these things, too, are from the spiritual world, or heaven, which is in the form of man, as has been shown above in the relevant section, so all the particulars in this kingdom have a certain relation to such things as are in man, as is well known to some in the learned world. It has been made clear to me by much experience that all things in this kingdom also are correspondences. For, often when I have been in gardens, and have been looking at the trees, fruits, flowers and vegetables there, I have observed their correspondences in heaven, and have spoken with those in whom these were, and have been taught whence and what they were. </p><p align="center">------------</p>

<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #109 (original Latin)</h4><p>109. Quomodo illa quae in Vegetabili Regno correspondent, constare potest a multis ut quod seminula in arbores crescant, folia excludant, flores producant, et dein fructus, in quibus iterum semina ponunt; et quod haec fiant successive et existant simul in tam admirando ordine, ut non possit paucis describi; volumina erunt, et tamen usque interiora arcana, quae usibus illorum propiora sunt, non exhauriri scientia possunt. Quoniam illa quoque ex spirituali mundo sunt seu caelo, quod in forma hominis est, ut supra in suo articulo ostensum est, inde etiam singula in illo regno, quandam relationem habent ad talia quae apud hominem; quod etiam quibusdam in orbe erudito notum est. Quod omnia quae in illo regno etiam correspondentiae sint, patuit mihi ex multa experientia saepius enim cum in hortis fui, et ibi inspexi arbores, fructus, flores et legumina, correspondentias animadverti in caelo, et locutus sum cum illis apud quos erant, et instructus undenam erant, et quales erant. </p>
