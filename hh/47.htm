<h4 align="center"></h4><p>47、组成同一个社群的所有天使，他们的容貌大体相似，但细节上相异。在某种程度上，可以从世上类似的现象中看出这种普遍的相似性与个体上的差异是如何关联的。众所周知，每个种族在脸部和眼睛上有某种相似之处，通过这种相似性，人们可以了解并区别于所有其他种族。对于不同的家族来说更是如此。在天堂里，情况更是显而易见，因为在那里，一切内在的情感都在脸上显现、闪耀出来。因为在那里，脸是这些情感的外在和代表形式，除了他自己的情感之脸外，没有人能有任何其他的面孔。<a href="#a96">｛注1｝</a>展现给我看的，还有这种总体相似性在社群个体身上表现出的细节上的变化。一张天使般的脸出现在我面前，它根据该社群里天使对良善和真理的情感而变化。这些变化持续了很长时间。我注意到，这张脸总体上保持着一个基调，其余的脸都是由此衍生而来的产物。通过这张脸，整个社群的情感得以展现，而社群中个体的脸则由此而变化，正如上文所述，天使的脸是他们内在的表现形式，即爱和信的情感的表现形式。<br><br>
<a name="a96">｛注1｝</a>：【英58】瑞典伯格发现，看得见的面部表情与内在心智或灵性状态之间的关系，是他的关键概念“代表”和“对应”的极好例证（见英注9和54）。他在《属天的奥秘》（<a href="../ac/2987.htm">2987</a>-<a href="../ac/2990.htm">2990</a>）中更彻底地发展了象征意义。【中】概括地说，人的面部表情是内在心智的“代表”或“表现”，当它们一致时，就是“对应”。</p>

<p>47. 形成同一个天使社群的所有天使的面容以一种总体而非细节的方式彼此相似. 从世上的类似现象可在某种程度上理解这种总体上的相似和细节上的不同是如何产生的. 众所周知, 每个种族在脸面和眼睛上具有某种相似性, 并凭这种相似性为人所知, 与其他所有种族区别开来. 不同家族之间尤其如此. 在天堂, 这种现象更是显而易见, 因为在那里, 一切内在情感从脸上表现和闪耀出来. 事实上, 在天堂, 脸是这些情感外在和代表形式. 在那里, 除了自己的情感之脸外, 没有人拥有其它任何脸. 我还被指示这种总体的相似在细节上如何因社群的个体而各不相同. 有一张像天使那样的脸向我显现, 这脸照着对诸如属同一个社群的天使里面的良善与真理的情感而发生变化. 这些变化持续了很长时间, 我发现, 这张脸总体上保持一个基调, 而其余的脸只是由此而来的衍生和产生物. 整个社群的情感就这样通过这张脸被展现出来, 而当中个体的脸则由此各式各样. 因为如前所述, 天使的脸是他们自己的内层, 因而是属于其爱与信的情感之形式. </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>47. 同一社群的所有天人, 他們的相貌大體類似, 只是細節各異。根據人間類似的現象, 我能在一定程度上把握這種總體上的類似和細節上的差異。眾所周知, 每個種族在相貌和眼神上存在總體上的類似, 我們由此區分不同的種族。種族之間如此, 家族之間尤甚, 天國則更加淋漓盡致。因為在天國, 人的內在情感是可見的, 它透過臉龐映現出來;臉龐就是他外在的相。在天國, 人的面貌不能異<br><br>於他的內在情感。我被演示這種總體上的類似在社群內的個體身上是如何顯出細<br><br>節上的差異的。有一張面孔向我顯現出來。根據該社群內個體對善與理的熱愛情形之差異, 面貌持續發生著變化。我注意到, 在整個過程中, 面貌的基本格調保持不變, 只是衍生的細節在發生改變。這樣, 整個社群的情感特質向我顯示出來, 當中個體的面貌差異源出於此。正如前面所說, 天人的面貌乃是他內在特質的彰顯, 或者是其仁與信的外顯。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #47 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>47. All the individuals who make up a particular angelic community have a general facial resemblance, but differ in detail. I could grasp this general similarity and particular difference to some extent on the basis of similar situations in this world. We know that every race has a general similarity about the face and eyes that enables us to recognize it and distinguish it from other races, and that the same is even more true from one family to another. This holds true much more perfectly in the heavens, because there all the deeper feelings are visible and shine forth from the face, the face there being their outward and graphic form. It is not possible in heaven to have a face that differs from our feelings. <br><br>I have also been shown how this general similarity is varied in detail in the individuals of a single community. There was a kind of angelic face that appeared to me, and this was varied according to the qualities of affections for the good and the true that were characteristic of the individuals in a particular community. These variations lasted quite a while, and through it all I noticed that the same general face remained constant as a basis, with everything else being simply derivations and elaborations from it. In this way, too, I was shown the affections of the whole community that occasioned the differences in the faces of its members, for as already noted, the faces of angels are their deeper qualities taking form, which means they are forms of the affections proper to their love and faith. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #47 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p>47. All who form one angelic society resemble one another in countenance in a general way but not in particulars. How general resemblances and differences in particular come about can in some measure be apprehended from similar things in the world. It is well known that with every race there is a certain resemblance in the face and eyes by which it is known and distinguished from any other race. This is still more true of different families. In the heavens this is much more clearly seen because there all the interior affections appear and shine forth from the face. For, in the heavens, the face is the external and representative form of those affections. No one there can have any other face than that of his own affections. It was also shown how this general likeness is varied in particulars with the individuals of one society. A face like that of an angel appeared to me and this was varied to express such affections of good and truth as are in those who belong to a single society. These variations went on for a long time and I noticed that the same face in general remained all the while as a background, and that the rest of the faces were only derivations and propagations therefrom. Thus, by means of this face were exhibited the affections of the whole society whereby the faces of those in it are varied. For, as has been said above, the faces of angels are the forms of their own interiors, thus of the affections that are of love and faith. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #47 (Ager, 1900)</h4><p>47. All who form the same angelic society resemble each other in countenance in a general way, but not in particulars. How these general resemblances are related to differences in particulars can in some measure be seen from like things in the world. It is well known that with every race there is a certain general resemblance of face and eyes, by which it is known and distinguished from all other races. This is still more true of different families. In the heavens this is much more fully the case, because there all the interior affections appear in and shine forth from the face, for there the face is the external and representative form of those affections. No one there can have any other face than that of his own affection. It was also shown how this general likeness is varied in particulars with individuals in the same society. A face like an angel's appeared to me, and this was varied in accordance with such affections for good and truth as are in those who belong to a single society. These changes went on for a long time, and I noticed that the same face in general continued as a ground work, all besides being what was derived and produced from that. Thus by means of this face the affections of the whole society were exhibited, whereby the faces of those in it are varied. For, as has been said above, the faces of angels are the forms of their interiors, thus of the affections that belong to their love and faith. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #47 (original Latin)</h4><p>47. Omnes qui unam societatem angelicam formant, simili facie sunt in communi, sed non simili in particulari. Quomodo similitudines in communi et variationes in particulari se habent, aliquantum comprehendi potest ex talibus in mundo: notum est, quod unaquaevis gens aliquod commune simile ferat in faciebus et oculis, per quod noscitur, et internoscitur ab alia gente et adhuc magis una familia ab altera sed hoc multo perfectius in caelis, quia ibi omnes affectiones interiores apparent et elucent ex facie, nam facies ibi est illarum forma externa et repraesentativa; aliam faciem habere quam suarum affectionum, non datur in caelo. Ostensum etiam est, quomodo communis similitudo variatur particulariter in singulis qui in una societate sunt: erat facies sicut angelica, quae mihi apparebat, et haec variabatur secundum affectiones boni et veri, quales sunt apud illos qui in una societate; variationes illae persistebant diu et observabam, quod usque eadem facies in communi sicut planum permaneret, et quod reliquae essent modo derivationes et propagationes inde sic etiam per hanc faciem ostensae sunt affectiones totius societatis, per quas variantur facies illorum qui ibi; nam, ut supra dictum est, facies angelicae sunt formae interiorum suorum, ita affectionum quae amoris et fidei. </p>
