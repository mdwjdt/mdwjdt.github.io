<h4 align="center"></h4><p>363、死后，每个人的主导情感或主导爱都会与他同在，永不根除，因为人的灵完全就是他的爱。有一个秘密，即每个灵人和天使的身体都是其爱的外在形式，精确地对应其内在形式，也就是其性情和心智。因此，灵人的品性能从他们的脸上、姿势和言语中得知。当人活在尘世时，如果他没有学会在脸上、姿势和言语上伪装成不是自己的东西，那么灵的品性也能为别人所知。这一切能证实，人保持到永远的正如他的主导情感或主导爱一样。<br><br>
我蒙允许与一千七百多年前的一些人交谈，他们的生活在当时所著的书中广为人知。我发现，他们仍然像当时一样被同样的爱所统治。由此也可以证实，每个人对财富及其功用的热爱将保持到永远，如在世时所获得的那份爱完全相同。不同之处在于：对那些致力于善用财富的人来说，财富在来世会变成与所发挥的功用相一致的快乐；而对那些致力于恶用财富的人来说，财富则变成纯粹的污秽，那时，他们在其中享受着与世界上恶用财富一样的快乐。他们以这污秽为乐，因为污秽的乐趣和可耻的行为，也就是他们将财富所投入的用处，以及贪婪，也就是不关注功用而贪恋财富，都对应于污秽。属灵的污秽不是别的。</p>
<p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>363. 死后, 每个人的主导情感或主导爱都会与他同在, 永不根除, 因为人的灵完全就像他的爱; 以前闻所未闻的是, 每个灵人和天使的身体都是其爱的外在形式, 完全对应于其内在形式, 也就是其性情与心智. 因此, 其灵的品质从他的脸, 动作和言语就能得知. 而人活在世上时, 如果他没有学会在脸, 动作和言语上伪造不是自己的东西, 那么灵的品质也能为人所知. 这一切表明, 人自己的永恒品质就是他的主导情感或爱的品质. 我蒙允许与一千七百多年前的一些人交谈, 他们的生活从那个时代的著作清楚可知. 我发现, 主导他们的仍是他们在世时所拥有的爱. 由此也可以推断, 对财富及其功用的爱, 将永远与每个人同在, 具有它在世时所获得的品质. 不同之处在于: 对那些将财富投入善用的人来说, 财富在来世会变成与所发挥的功用相一致的快乐; 而对那些将财富投入恶用的人来说, 财富则变成纯粹的污秽; 那时, 他们以这种污秽为快乐, 正如在世时他们以其被投入恶用的财富为快乐. 他们以污秽为快乐是因为, 污秽的乐趣和可耻的行为, 也就是他们将财富所投入的功用, 以及贪婪, 也就是不关注功用而对财富的贪恋, 就对应于污秽. 属灵的污秽不是别的. </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>363. 死後, 等待每一個人的是他的主導情感或主導欲(或主導愛), 它永不根除, 因為人的靈正如他的欲望或所愛。人之前所不瞭解的是, 每個靈或天人的身體乃是其所愛的外在形相, 與其內在形相——即其秉性與心靈, 是完全相應的。因此, 從表情, 姿勢, 語言可看出一個靈的品性, 人若尚未學會偽裝表情, 姿勢, 語言, 其靈也能被世人洞悉。由此可見, 人永恆的品性, 即其主導情感或主導欲的品性。<br><br>我曾被允許與一千七百多年前的人交談, 他們的生活從當時的文字記錄可知。我發現, 主導他們的依然是其活在人間時的所愛與情感。<br><br>由此還能看出, 對財富及其用途的愛慕, 將永遠與人同在, 正如其在人間所取得的品性。所不同的是, 對於將財富作為發揮作用之工具的人, 啟啟的啟慕將變為與作用一致的快樂;而對於將財富用於造惡的人, 啟啟的啟慕則變成啟穢。他們熱愛啟穢, 正如在世時熱愛被其濫用的財富, 因為他們所追求的啟濁的樂趣與貪婪(愛財卻不著思於用), 啟穢是對應的。心靈意義的啟穢無非如是。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #363 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>363. After death, our ruling affection or love awaits each one of us. This is never rooted out to eternity because our spirit is exactly like our love; and (what has not been known before) the body of every spirit and angel is an outward form of her or his love that is completely responsive to the inner form that is the character and mind of that spirit or angel. That is why you can recognize the quality of spirits from their faces, their postures, and their speech. That is why our own spirits are recognized in this world if we have not learned how to pretend with our faces and postures and speech. We may gather from this that our own eternal quality is that of our ruling affection or love. <br><br>I have been allowed to talk with people who lived more than seventeen centuries ago, people whose lives are known from the literature of their own times; and I have been convinced that the same love they had then is still sustaining them. <br><br>We may also gather from this that a love of wealth and the usefulness it affords also remains with us forever, with exactly the quality it acquired in this world. There is this difference, though: for people whose wealth served them as means to useful lives, it is turned into delights in keeping with their usefulness, while for people whose wealth served them as means to evil activities, it is turned into filth - filth that they enjoy just as much as they enjoyed their ill-used wealth in the world. The reason they enjoy the filth is that the foul pleasures and pursuits that were their practices in the world, and their greed (which is a love of wealth with no thought of use), correspond to filth. Spiritual filth is nothing else. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #363 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p>363. Every man's ruling affection or love remains with him after death, nor is it rooted out to eternity, since a man's spirit is wholly what his love is, and what is an arcanum, the body of every spirit and angel is the outward form of his love, exactly corresponding to his inward form, which is the form of his "animus" and mind. Consequently, spirits are known as to their quality from their face, gestures, and speech. While a man is living in the world the quality of the spirit would be known if he had not learned to counterfeit in his face, movements, and speech that which is not his own. From this it can be confirmed that man remains to eternity such as his ruling affection or love is. It has been granted me to talk with some who lived seventeen centuries ago, and whose lives are well known from writings of that time, and it was found that the same love still rules them as it did then. It can also be confirmed from this that the love of riches, and of uses from riches, remains with everyone to eternity, and that it is exactly the same as the love acquired in the world, yet with the difference that in the case of those who devoted their riches to good uses, riches are changed in the other world into delights which are in accord with the uses performed; while in the case of those who devoted their riches to evil uses, riches are turned into mere filth, in which they then take the same delight as they did in the world in their riches devoted to evil uses. Such then take delight in filth because filthy pleasures and shameful acts, which had been the uses to which they had devoted their riches, and also avarice, which is a love of riches without regard to use, correspond to filth. Spiritual filth is nothing else. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #363 (Ager, 1900)</h4><p>363. Every man's ruling affection or love remains with him after death, nor is it rooted out to eternity, since a man's spirit is wholly what his love is, and what is unknown, the body of every spirit and angel is the outward form of his love, exactly corresponding to his inward form, which is the form of his disposition and mind; consequently the quality of his spirit is known from his face, movements, and speech. While a man is living in the world the quality of the spirit would be known if he had not learned to counterfeit in his face, movements, and speech what is not his own. All this shows that man remains to eternity such as his ruling affection or love is. It has been granted me to talk with some who lived seventeen hundred years ago, and whose lives are well known from writings of that time, and it was found that the same love still rules them as when they were on the earth. This makes clear also that the love of riches, and of uses from riches, remains with everyone to eternity, and that it is exactly the same as the love acquired in the world, yet with the difference that in the case of those who devoted their riches to good uses riches are changed in the other world into delights which are in accord with the uses performed; while in the case of those who devoted their riches to evil uses riches are turned into mere filth, in which they then take the same delight as they did in the world in their riches devoted to evil uses.

<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #363 (original Latin)</h4><p>363. Unumquemvis hominem manet post mortem ejus affectio seu amor dominans ille non exstirpatur in aeternum; quoniam hominis spiritus prorsus est sicut ejus amor, et quod arcanum est, cujusvis spiritus et angeli corpus est ejus amoris forma externa prorsus correspondens formae internae quae est ejus animi et mentis: inde est quod spiritus noscantur quales sunt ex facie, ex gestibus, et ex loquela et quoque nosceretur homo quoad spiritum suum dum vivit in mundo, si non didicisset facie, gestu, et loquela mentiri non sua. Inde constare potest, quod homo in aeternum maneat, qualis est ejus affectio seu amor praedominans. Loqui datum est cum aliquibus, qui vixerunt ante septendecim saecula, quorum vita ex scriptis eo tempore nota est, et compertum quod adhuc ferat illos amor suus qui tunc fuit. Inde quoque constare potest, quod amor divitiarum ac usuum ex divitiis maneat unumquemvis in aeternum, et prorsus talis sit qualis comparatus est in mundo cum ea tamen differentia, quod divitiae apud illos quibus inserviverant pro bonis usibus vertantur in jucunditates secundum usus, et quod divitiae apud illos quibus inserviverant pro malis usibus vertantur in sordes, quibus etiam tunc delectantur similiter ut in mundo divitiis propter malos usus. Quod tunc delectentur sordibus, est quia spurcae voluptates et flagitia, quae fuerunt usus ex illis, et quoque avaritia, quae est amor divitiarum absque usu, sordibus correspondent; sordes spirituales non aliae sunt. </p>
