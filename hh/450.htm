<h4 align="center"></h4><p>450、人复苏后，属天的天使不会离开他，因为他们爱每一个人。但有些灵根本无法与天堂的天使在一起很长时间，他希望他们离开。当这种情况发生时，主的属灵国度的天使便来到，通过他们，人的灵被允许获得光明，因为在此之前，他只能思考，什么也看不见。<br><br>
我也被展示这一切是如何发生的。天使似乎从我的左眼向鼻梁<a href="#a480">｛注1｝</a>卷起一覆盖层，这样我的眼睛被打开，就能够看见。这只是一种表象，但对人的灵来说，这似乎是实实在在发生的事。随着这覆盖层仿佛被卷起来，我有了轻微的光感，但很模糊，就像刚刚睡醒时透过眼皮所看见的光。在我看来，这模糊的光呈现出天堂的色彩，但后来我被告知，色彩各不相同。然后，我感觉好像有什么东西从我脸上轻柔地滚下来，当这一切完成时，属灵的思想就被诱导出来了。从脸上滚下来也是一种表象，它代表着灵正从物质思想转入灵性思想。天使们极其小心，以便让复苏的灵只发出带有爱的意味的意念。这时，他们会告诉他，他是一个灵人。<a href="#a481">｛注2｝</a><br><br>
当他进入光的享受时，属灵天使向新的灵人提供他在这种状态下可能渴望的一切服务，并在他能理解的范围内教他关于来世的事情。但如果这个灵人不愿受教，就想摆脱天使们的陪伴。然而，天使们仍不离开他，但他却将自己与天使们分开。因为天使们爱每个人，只渴望提供服务、教导并引导人进入天堂，这是他们至高无上的快乐。<br><br>
当该灵人离开后，善灵会接待他，陪伴他，也尽可能地为他做一切事。然而，如果他在世时所过的生活使得他无法享受善良之人陪伴的乐趣，他就渴望离开他们，这种经历不断重复，直到他与这样的人联系在一起：他们与他在尘世的生活完全和谐一致。他就这样找到了自己的生活，令人惊讶的是，他又过着他在世上所过的那种生活。<br><br>
<a name="a480">｛注1｝</a>：【英263】“鼻梁”的原文是septum，与英文单词septum的字面意义相同，可译为“鼻中隔”。<br><br>
<a name="a489">｛注2｝</a>：【中】这里“灵人”和前面的“灵”是同一个词。在强调与肉体结合在一起时，译为“灵”较为合适，而在强调与肉体分离后，灵以人形存在于灵界时，译为“灵人”则更为合适。</p>

<p>450. 与复活之人同在的属天天使不会离开他, 因为他们爱每个人. 但是, 有些灵人会进入这样的状态, 他们不能长时间地与属天天使同在, 而是希望他们离开. 当出现这种情形时, 来自主的属灵国度的天使便到来, 他通过这些天使被赋予对光的使用; 因为此前他什么也看不见, 只能思考. 我也被指示这一切是如何成就的. 天使似乎将一层膜从我的左眼卷到鼻梁, 以便我的眼睛被打开, 能够看见. 这只是一种表象, 但对灵人来说, 这事似乎实实在在发生了. 随着这层膜似乎被如此卷起, 我能看见一种明净但又极其微弱的光, 就像刚刚睡醒时透过眼帘所看见的光. 在我看来, 这明净而又微弱的光带有一种天堂色彩, 但后来我被告知, 这种色彩各不相同. 此后, 我感觉好像有东西从我脸庞被轻柔地卷起; 一旦这一切完成, 属灵的思维就被唤醒了, 或说我可以进入属灵的思维了. 从脸庞的这种卷起也是一种表象, 因为它代表以下事实: 灵正从属世思维转入属灵思维. 天使竭尽全力保护复活的人, 以便只有诸如带有爱意味的观念从他发出. 这时, 他们会告诉他, 他是一个灵. 属灵天使赋予他对光的使用后, 会为新来的灵提供他在此状态下所能想到的一切服务. 天使在他的理解程度内教导他来世的真相. 但这个灵人若不愿受教, 就想远离天使的陪伴. 然而, 天使仍不离开他; 相反, 他却离开他们. 事实上, 天使爱每个人, 只渴望提供服务, 教导并引领人们进入天堂. 这是他们至高无上的快乐. 当该灵人离开天使的陪伴时, 陪伴他的善灵会接待他, 也尽其所能地为他做一切事. 然而, 如果他在世时所过的生活使得他无法享有善人的陪伴, 他就想远离善人. 这种经历反复进行, 直到他和诸如与他在世时的生活完全和谐一致的人联系在一起. 他便在此找到自己的生命; 说来奇妙, 这时, 他又过上在世时所过的那种生活. </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>450. 與蘇醒之靈同在的仁智天人不會離開, 他們愛每一個人。但若某靈不願與仁智天人相處時, 期望離開他們。此時, 會有天人從主的義信天國而來, 通過他們來賦予光明;此前, 靈看不見任何東西, 只能思想。<br><br>這個過程曾向我演示:感覺從左眼到鼻樑仿佛有一層膜被天人卷起, 我的眼睛就開了, 能看見了。對靈來說, 這事看似真的發生了, 其實它只是仿佛發生了。隨著這層膜仿佛被卷起來, 我看見一片明淨但微弱的光, 正如睡醒時透過眼簾所見之光。在我看來, 這明淨但微弱的光帶有天國色彩, 但後來我被告知, 每個人的情況不盡相同。此後, 我感覺好像有東西從臉龐被輕柔地卷起來, 心靈的思想就被喚醒了。有東西被卷起來, 這也是一種表像, 表示我的思維方式從物質轉入心靈了。<br><br>天人們無微不至地看顧剛蘇醒的人, 儘量保護剛蘇醒之靈于仁愛的體驗之中。彼時, 天人將告訴蘇醒之人, 他是一個靈。<br><br>義信天人帶來光明以後, 新來的靈若有任何願望, 天人都會盡力相助。天人會照我們所能領悟的, 告訴我們來世的真相。若是靈不願受教, 就想離開, 不與天人相處。並非天人離開靈, 是靈離開天人。天人真切地愛每一個靈, 最大的心願莫過幫助他們, 教導他們, 將他們引入天國;這也是他們最大的快樂。<br><br>離開天人以後, 會有善靈前來接引, 與靈作伴, 也盡其所能地給予幫助。但是, 靈在人間的生活若決定他們不願與善者相處, 必再次尋求離開。<br><br>上述過程會根據需要而重複多次, 直到靈尋見適合自己秉性的社群。彼時, 靈找到了自己的生活;奇怪的是, 他們又過上與人間相仿的生活。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #450 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>450. When heavenly angels are with people who have been awakened they do not leave them, because they love everyone. But some spirits are simply unable to be in the company of heavenly angels very long, and want them to leave. When this happens, angels from the Lord's spiritual kingdom arrive, through whom we are granted the use of light, since before this we could not see anything but could only think. <br><br>I was also shown how this is done. It seemed as though the angels rolled back a covering from my left eye toward the center of my nose so that my eye was opened and able to see. To the spirit, it seems as though this were actually happening, but it is only apparently so. As this covering seemed to be rolled back, I could see a kind of clear but dim light like the light we see through our eyelids when we are first waking up. It seemed to me as though this clear, dim light had a heavenly color to it, but I was later told that this varies. After that, it felt as though something were being rolled gently off my face, and once this was done I had access to spiritual thought. This rolling something off the face is an appearance, for it represents the fact that we are moving from natural thinking to spiritual thinking. Angels take the greatest care to shield the awakening person from any concept that does not taste of love. Then they tell the individual that he or she is a spirit. <br><br>After the spiritual angels have given us the use of light, they do everything for us as newly arrived spirits that we could ever wish in that state. They tell us - at least to the extent that we can grasp it - about the realities of the other life. However, if our nature is such that we do not want to be taught, then once we are awakened we want to get out of the company of angels. Still, the angels do not leave us, but we do leave them. Angels really do love everyone. They want nothing more than to help people, to teach them, to lead them into heaven. This is their highest joy. <br><br>When spirits leave the company of angels, they are welcomed by the good spirits who are accompanying them and who also do all they can for them. However, if they had led the kind of life in the world that makes it impossible for them to be in the company of good people, then they want to get away from these as well. This happens as long and as many times as necessary, until they find the company of people their earthly life has fitted them for. Here they find their life; and remarkable as it may sound, they then lead the same kind of life they had led in the world. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #450 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p> 450. The celestial angels who are with the one who is resuscitated do not withdraw from him, because they love everyone; but when the spirit is such that he can no longer be associated with celestial angels, he longs to get away from them. When this takes place, angels from the Lord's spiritual kingdom come, through whom is given the use of light; for before this he saw nothing, but merely thought. I was also shown how this happens. The angels appeared to roll off, as it were, a coat from the left eye towards the bridge of the nose, that the eye might be opened and be enabled to see. This is only an appearance, but to the spirit it seemed to be really done. When the coat thus seems to have been rolled off there is a slight sense of light, but very dim, like what is seen through the eyelids on first awakening from sleep. To me this dim light took on a heavenly hue, but I was told afterwards that the colour varies. Then something is felt to be gently rolled off from the face, and when this is done spiritual thought is induced. This rolling off from the face is also an appearance, which represents the spirit's passing from natural thought into spiritual thought. The angels are extremely careful that only such ideas as savour of love shall proceed from the one resuscitated. They now tell him that he is a spirit. When he has come into the enjoyment of light, the spiritual angels render to the new spirit every service he can possibly desire in that state, and teach him about the things of the other life so far as he can comprehend them. But if he has no wish to be taught, the spirit longs to get away from the company of the angels. Nevertheless, the angels do not withdraw from him, but he separates himself from them; for the angels love everyone, and desire nothing so much as to render service, to teach, and to lead into heaven; this constitutes their highest delight. When the spirit has thus withdrawn, he is received by good spirits, and as long as he continues in their company everything possible is done for him. But if he had lived such a life in the world as would prevent his enjoying the company of the good, he longs to get away from them, and this experience is repeated until he comes into association with such as are in entire harmony with his life in the world; and with such he finds his own life, and what is surprising, he then leads a life like that which he led in the world. </p><p align="center">------------</p>

<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #450 (original Latin)</h4><p>450. Cum angeli caelestes apud resuscitatum sunt, non relinquunt eum, quia unumquemvis amant sed cum spiritus talis est ut in caelestium angelorum consortio non amplius esse possit, tunc ille ab iis discedere avet; quod cum fit, veniunt angeli e regno spirituali Domini, per quos datur ei usura lucis, nam prius nihil vidit, sed solum cogitavit: ostensum quoque est quomodo hoc fit. Videbantur angeli illi quasi evolvere tunicam oculi sinistri versus septum nasi, ut aperiretur oculus, et daretur videre; spiritus non aliter appercipit quam quod ita fiat, sed est apparentia. Cum visum est evolvisse tunicam, apparet quoddam lucidum sed obscurum, quasi dum homo in prima vigilia per palpebras spectat; hoc lucidum obscurum mihi visum est coloris caelestis; sed dein dictum, quod hoc fiat cum varietate. Postea sentitur e facie quoddam molliter evolvi, quo facto inducitur cogitatio spiritualis: evolutio illa e facie etiam est apparentia, nam per id repraesentatur quod a cogitatione naturali in cogitationem spiritualem veniat. Cavent angeli summa opera, ne aliqua idea a resuscitato veniat, nisi quae sapit ex amore. Tunc dicunt ei quod sit spiritus. Angeli spirituales, postquam data est lucis usura, novo spiritui omnia officia, quae usquam desiderare in illo statu potest, praestant, ac instruunt de illis quae sunt in altera vita, sed quantum capere potest. At si non talis est ut instrui velit, tunc resuscitatus cupit ab angelorum illorum consortio sed usque angeli non relinquunt illum, verum is se dissociat ab illis; angeli enim unumquemvis amant, et nihil prius desiderant quam officia praestare, instruere, et auferre in caelum in eo eorum summa delectatio consistit. Spiritus cum se sic dissociat, excipitur a spiritibus bonis, in quorum consortio cum est, etiam ei omnia officia praestantur: at si vita ejus talis in mundo fuerat, ut in consortio bonorum non esse potuerit, tunc quoque ab iis cupit, et hoc tamdiu et toties, usque dum se associat talibus, qui vitae ejus in mundo prorsus conveniunt, apud quos vitam suam invenit, et tunc, quod mirum, similem vitam agit, qualem in mundo. </p>
