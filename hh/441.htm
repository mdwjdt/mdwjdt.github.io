<h4 align="center"></h4><p>441、至于第二种情况，也就是被灵人带到另一个地方，我也通过活生生的经历得知它是什么样的情形、是怎样发生的。不过这样的经历仅有两三次。我只举一个例子。<br><br>
我一边走过城市的街道、穿过郊外的田野，一边与灵人交谈，只知道我和平常一样完全清醒，拥有平常的视觉，因而视野清晰地行走，也没有迷路，看见小树林、河流、宫殿、房屋、人和其他东西。但就这样走了几个小时后，我突然用我的肉眼观看，我注意到自己在另一个地方。我非常惊讶，意识到自己和那些据说被圣灵带另一个地方的人一样，处在同样的状态。因为在这种状态下，没有想到距离，即使有许多英里；也没有想到时间，即使有许多个小时甚至几天；也没有任何疲劳的感觉。就这样，一个人被正确地引导，行过他自己所不熟悉的路程，甚至到了某个预定的地方。</p>

<p>441. 至于被灵带到另一个地方, 我已通过活生生的经历说明它是何情形, 如何发生的, 不过这样的经历仅有两三次. 我只举一个例子. 当我一边穿行于城市的街道, 郊外的田野, 一边与灵人交谈时, 只知道我和平常一样完全清醒, 拥有平常的视觉, 行走也没有出现差错, 一直处在异象中. 我看见小树林, 河流, 宫殿, 房屋, 百姓, 以及其它物体. 就这样走了几个小时后, 我突然又用肉眼观看, 发现自己到了另一个地方. 震惊之余, 我意识到自己一直处于经上所描述的被灵带到另一个地方之人所处的状态. 因为在这种状态下, 我没有想到路程, 即便它有许多公里, 也没有想到时间, 即便它有许多小时, 甚至许多天. 我也没有任何疲惫的感觉. 这就是人通过他自己所不知的方式被准确无误地引领, 甚至被引到某个预定地方的方式. </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>441. 關於後者, 也就是被靈帶入他境, 通過親身經歷, 我得知它是怎麼一回事, 不過我僅有過兩三次經歷。我就說說其中的一次:當時, 我與一些靈走過城市的街道, 穿過郊外的田野, 全神貫注地交談。在我看來, 我就是醒著的, 眼睛看得分明, 行走也沒有差池。在此過程中, 我一直是在異象當中。我看見樹林, 河流, 宮殿, 房屋, 群眾, 等等。幾個時辰以後, 我突然回到肉眼的視覺當中, 發現自己到了另一個地方。我很驚訝, 意識到自己是經歷了人們所說的被靈帶入他境的狀態。在那過程中, 時間和距離都不在考慮當中, 雖然它可能持續幾個時辰甚至幾天, 走過很遠的路程, 也不覺得疲倦。就這樣, 人可能走過未知的路程, 毫無差池地被引到某個預定的地方。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #441 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>441. As for the second kind of experience, being led by the spirit into another place, I have been shown by firsthand experience what happens and how it happens, but only two or three times. I should like to cite just one experience. While I was walking through city streets and through the countryside, absorbed in conversation with spirits, it seemed exactly as though I were just as awake and observant as ever, walking without straying, though all the while I was in visions. I was seeing groves, rivers, mansions, houses, people, and more. After I had been walking for some hours, though, I suddenly found myself back in consciousness of my physical sight and realized that I was somewhere else. I was utterly stunned by this, and realized that I had been in the state of people described as being led by the spirit into another place; for as long as it lasted I was not thinking about my route, even though it might have been many miles, or about the time, though it might have been many hours or even days. I was not conscious of any fatigue, either. This is how we can be led by ways we know nothing of all the way to some predetermined place, without straying. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #441 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p> 441. As regards the second, being carried away by the spirit to another place, I have been shown by living experience what it is, and how it is done, but only two or three times. I wish to relate a single instance. Walking through the streets of a city and through fields, talking at the same time with spirits, I did not know otherwise than that I was fully awake, and in possession of my usual sight. Thus I walked on without going astray, and all the while with clear vision, seeing groves, rivers, palaces, houses, men, and other objects. But after walking thus for some hours, suddenly I saw with my bodily eyes, and noted that I was in another place. Being greatly astonished I perceived that I had been in the same state as those who were said to have been led away by the spirit into another place. For in this state there is no reflection upon the distance, even though it be many miles, nor any reflection upon the time, though it be many hours or days, neither is there any feeling of fatigue; and one is led unerringly through ways of which he himself is ignorant, even to the destined place. </p><p align="center">------------</p>

<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #441 (original Latin)</h4><p>441. Quod alterum attinet, a spiritu in alium locum auferri, ostensum est mihi per vivam experientiam, quid sit, et quomodo fit, sed hoc solum bis et ter; solam experientiam velim afferre. Per plateas urbis, et per campestria ambulans, tunc quoque in loquela cum spiritibus, non aliter scivi quam quod ita vigil essem et videns sicut aliis temporibus ita ambulans absque errore; et interea in visione eram, videns lucos, fluvios, palatia, domus, homines, et plura. Sed postquam ita per horas ambulavi, subito eram in visu corporis, et animadverti quod in alio loco essem quo obstupefactus valde appercepi quod in tali statu fuerim, in quo illi, de quibus dicitur, quod abducti a spiritu in alium locum; nam dum perstat, nihil reflectitur super viam, et hoc sive foret plurium milliarium; nec reflectitur super tempus, sive foret plurium horarum aut dierum; nec fatigatio ulla percipitur tunc quoque ducitur per vias quas ipse ignorat, usque ad locum designatum, absque errore. </p>
