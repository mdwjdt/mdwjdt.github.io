<p>414. 天堂里的人不断朝着生命的春天迈进. 他们越活数千年, 他们的春天就越喜乐, 幸福. 这一切会持续到永远, 并照着他们的爱, 仁和信的生长和层级而增长. 那些因年老体衰而死去的妇人若曾活在对主之信, 对邻之仁, 以及与丈夫美满的婚姻之爱中, 随着岁月流逝, 将越来越进入花样年华, 进入楚楚动人的少女期, 以及超出世人对眼见之美的一切概念的美丽. 良善和仁爱便赋予她们这种形式, 从而将她们自己的形像显现出来, 使得仁爱的喜乐和优美从面庞的每一个最小细节闪耀出来, 使她们成为仁爱的实际形式. 一些看见她们的人惊愕不已. 在天堂, 以活生生的方式所看到的仁爱形式是这样, 正是仁爱本身赋予并被赋予可见形式. 事实上, 它以这样的方式如此行: 整个天使, 尤其脸庞, 可以说就是仁爱本身; 这仁爱既清晰可见, 又能被感受到. 当人们看到这种形式时, 它的美丽无法言说, 并以仁爱感染心智的至内层. 总之, 在天堂, 变老就是变年轻. 那些曾活在对主之爱和对邻之仁中的人在来世就会变成这种形式或这种美丽. 所有天使都是这种形式, 并具有无限多样性; 而天堂就是由这些构成的. </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #414 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>414. People in heaven are continually progressing toward the springtime of life. The more thousands of years they live, the more pleasant and happy is their springtime. This continues forever, increasing according to the growth and level of their love, thoughtfulness, and faith. <br><br>As the years pass, elderly women who have died of old age - women who have lived in faith in the Lord, thoughtfulness toward their neighbor, and in contented marriage love with their husbands - come more and more into the flower of growing youth and into a beauty that surpasses any notion of beauty accessible to our sight. Their goodness and thoughtfulness is what gives them their form and gives them its own likeness, making the pleasure and beauty of thoughtfulness radiate from every least corner of their faces so that they become actual forms of thoughtfulness. Some people have seen them and have been stunned. The form of thoughtfulness that is open to view in heaven is like this because it is thoughtfulness itself that both gives and is given visible form. In fact, it does this in such a way that the whole angel, especially her face, is virtually thoughtfulness itself appearing to open perception. When people look at this form, its beauty is unutterable, affecting the very inmost life of the mind with thoughtfulness. In a word, to grow old in heaven is to grow young. People who have lived in love for the Lord and in thoughtfulness toward their neighbor are forms like this, or beauties like this, in the other life. All angels are forms like this, in infinite variety. This is what makes heaven. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #414 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p>414. Those who are in heaven are continually advancing towards the spring of life, with a greater advance towards a more joyful and happy spring the more thousands of years they live; and this to eternity, with increase according to the growth and degree of their love, charity, and faith. Women who have died old and worn out with age, if they have lived in faith in the Lord, in charity to the neighbour, and in happy conjugial love with a husband, advance with the succession of years more and more into the flower of youth and early womanhood, and into a beauty that transcends every conception of any such beauty as is seen on the earth. Goodness and charity is what gives this form and thus manifests its own likeness, causing the joy and beauty of charity to shine forth from every least particular of the face, and causing them to be the very forms of charity. Some who beheld this were struck with amazement. The form of charity that is seen in a living way in heaven, is such that it is charity itself that both forms and is formed; and this in such a manner that the whole angel is a charity, as it were, especially the face; and this is both clearly seen and felt. When this form is beheld it is beauty unspeakable, affecting with charity the very inmost life of the mind. In a word, to grow old in heaven is to grow young. Such forms or such beauties do those who have lived in love to the Lord and in charity towards the neighbour become in the other life. All angels are such forms in endless variety; and of these heaven is constituted. </p><p align="center">------------</p>

<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #414 (original Latin)</h4><p>414. Qui in caelo sunt, continue ad vernum vitae pergunt et quo plura millia annorum vivunt, eo ad vernum jucundius et felicius, et hoc in aeternum, cum incrementis, secundum amoris, charitatis et fidei progressus et gradus. Ex sexu feminino, quae seniles ac senio confectae mortuae sunt, et in fide in Dominum, charitate erga proximum, et in amore conjugiali felici cum marito vixerunt, post annorum successum, magis et magis in juventutis et adolescentiae florem veniunt, inque pulchritudinem quae excedit omnem pulchritudinis ideam usquam visu perceptibilem bonitas et charitas est quae format, et sui simile sistit, et facit ut jucundum et pulchrum charitatis ex singularissimis faciei eluceat, sic ut ipsae charitatis formae sint visae sunt quibusdam, et obstupuerunt.<br><br> <br>[2] Charitatis forma est talis, quae ad vivum conspicitur in caelo, quod ipsa charitas sit quae effigiat et effigiatur, et quidem sic, ut totus angelus, cumprimis facies, sit quasi charitas, quae manifeste et apparet et percipitur quae forma, cum spectatur, est pulchritudo ineffabilis afficiens charitate ipsam vitam mentis intimam. Verbo, senescere in caelo est juvenescere. Qui in amore in Dominum et in charitate erga proximum vixerunt, tales formae, seu tales pulchritudines, in altera vita fiunt omnes angeli tales formae sunt, cum innumerabili varietate; ex his caelum. </p>
