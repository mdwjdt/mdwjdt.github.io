<h3 align="center" class="ired">《天堂与地狱》 第69节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>69、我曾经被允许看见一个天使社群在主显现时整体呈现为一个人的样式。在朝东的高空好像出现了一团云的东西往下降，由耀眼的白色变为红色，有小星星环绕。随着它渐渐地下降，变得越来越明亮，最后呈现为完美的人形。云周围的小星星都是天使，他们借着来自主的光芒而如此地显现。</p>
<p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>69. 我还蒙允许看见一整个天使社群, 主在那里显为可见, 以人的形式呈现为一位. 在朝东的高处, 有某种像一团云那样的事物出现, 从发白变得发红, 周围有小星星; 这团云正在下降, 并随着下降而变得更加明亮, 最后呈现为一个完美的人形. 云周围的小星星都是天使, 他们凭来自主的光而如此显现. </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>69. 當主顯現時, 我也曾看見整個天人群體呈現一個人的形態。彼時, 在東方高天之上, 有一團雲霧顯現, 起初白色, 後來變成紅色, 周圍有星光環繞。在下降的過程中, 雲團越來越亮, 最後呈現一個完美的人形。環繞的星光原來都是天人, 由於從主接收光明而顯出此等形像。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #69 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>69. I have also been allowed to see that a whole angelic community appears as a single entity in human form when the Lord makes himself present. High up toward the east, there appeared something that looked like a cloud, white at first and then reddening, surrounded by little stars. It came down, and as it gradually did so, it became brighter and finally took on a perfect human form. The little stars that surrounded the cloud were angels, who looked like that because of the light from the Lord. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #69 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p>69. I have also been permitted to see that an entire angelic society, when the Lord manifests Himself as present, appears as a one in the human form. There was visible on high, towards the east, something like a cloud, from dazzling white becoming red, with little stars round about, which were descending; by degrees as it descended, it became brighter and at last was seen in a perfect human form. The little stars round about the cloud were angels, who so appeared by virtue of light from the Lord. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #69 (Ager, 1900)</h4><p>69. I have also been permitted to see that an entire angelic society, where the Lord is visibly present, appears as a one in the human form. There appeared on high towards the east something like a cloud, from glowing white becoming red, and with little stars round about, which was descending; and as it gradually descended it became brighter, and at last appeared in a perfect human form. The little stars round about the cloud were angels, who so appeared by virtue of light from the Lord. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #69 (original Latin)</h4><p>69. Quod integra societas angelica, cum Dominus Se praesentem sistit, appareat ut unum in forma humana, etiam datum est videre. Apparebat in alto versus ortum sicut nubes a candido rubescens cum stellulis circumcirca, quae descendebat; illa per gradus sicut descendit, lucidior facta est, et tandem visa in forma perfecte humana: stellulae circumcirca nubem erant angeli, qui ita apparuerunt a luce ex Domino. </p>
