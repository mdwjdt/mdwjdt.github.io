<h4 align="center"></h4><p>238、由于天使的语言对应他们的情感，情感属于爱，而天堂之爱就是爱主爱邻（参看<a href="../hh/13.htm">13</a>-<a href="../hh/19.htm">19</a>节），可见他们的交谈是何等的优雅怡人，不仅悦耳，还能赏心——感动听者的心智内层。天使曾与一个心肠特别刚硬的灵人说话，最终，这个灵人被天使的话深深感动，痛哭流泪。他说自己以前从未哭过，这次是情不自禁，因为那是爱的话语。</p>

<p>238. 由于天使的语言与他们的情感相对应, 而他们的情感属于他们的爱, 天堂之爱就是对主之爱和对邻之爱(参看<a href="13.htm">13-19</a>节), 故明显可知他们的交谈必何等佳美, 怡人, 不仅悦耳, 还能打动那些聆听之人的心智内层. 天使曾与一个铁石心肠的灵人说话, 这个灵人最终因天使的话而如此感动, 以致他突然哭了起来, 声称他情不自禁, 因为这是爱在说话, 他以前从没哭过. </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>238. 天人的語言既與愛的情感對應, 而天國的愛又是愛主與愛鄰(<a href="13.htm">13-19</a>), 那麼顯然, 天人的聲音必是優雅動人的, 不僅悅耳, 而且怡神。我曾見天人與一個心腸剛硬的靈說話, 最終他被天人的話感動, 不禁熱淚盈眶。他稱自己從不哭泣, 但這次他情不自禁, 因為他聽到仁愛在說話。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #238 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>238. Since angels' language corresponds to the affections of their love, and since heaven's love is love for the Lord and love for our neighbor (see above, <a href="13.htm">13-19</a>), we can see how elegant and delightful their conversation is. It affects not only the ears but also the deeper levels of the minds of those who hear it. There was one particular hard-hearted spirit with whom an angel talked, and eventually he was so moved by what the angel was saying that he burst into tears, saying that he couldn't help it, love was talking, and he had never cried before. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #238 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p>238. Because the speech of angels corresponds to their affection, which is of love, and the love of heaven is love to the Lord and love towards the neighbour (see above, <a href="13.htm">13-19</a>), it is evident how choice and delightful their talk is. For it affects not only the ears but also the interiors of the mind of those who hear it. There was a certain hard-hearted spirit with whom an angel was speaking. At length he was so much affected by what was said that he shed tears, saying that he had never wept before, but he could not help doing so, for it was love speaking. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #238 (Ager, 1900)</h4><p>238. As the speech of angels corresponds to their affection, and their affection belongs to their love, and as the love of heaven is love to the Lord and love towards the neighbor (see above, <a href="13.htm">13-19</a>), it is evident how choice and delightful their talk must be, affecting not the ears only but also the interiors of the mind of those who listen to it. There was a certain hard-hearted spirit with whom an angel spoke. At length he was so affected by what was said that he shed tears, saying that he had never wept before, but he could not refrain, for it was love speaking. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #238 (original Latin)</h4><p>238. Quia loquela angelorum correspondet eorum affectioni quae amoris, et amor caeli est amor in Dominum et amor erga proximum (videatur supra, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_238/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_13" target=_top>13-19</a>), patet quam elegans et jucunda est loquela illorum afficit enim non modo aures, sed etiam interiora mentis illorum qui audiunt. Erat quidam spiritus durus corde, cum quo angelus loquebatur: ille ex loquela ejus tandem ita affectus est, ut lacrymas funderet; dicens, quod non resistere posset quia erat amor loquens, et quod prius nusquam lacrimaverit. </p>
