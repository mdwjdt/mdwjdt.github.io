<h3 align="center" class="ired">《天堂与地狱》 第344节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>344、由此可见在天堂里孩子的教育是怎样的，也就是说，它通过对真理的理解和良善的智慧引导他们进入天使的生命，这生命就在于爱主和互爱，其中包含着纯真。从这个的例子可以看出，在许多情况下，尘世的孩子的教育是何等的不同。我在一座大城市的街道上，看见几个小男孩在打架，人群蜂拥而来，兴高采烈地看着。有人告诉我，孩子们是被他们自己的父母怂恿打架的。透过我的眼睛目睹这一切的善灵和天使对此非常反感，我能感觉到他们的震惊，特别是父母竟然煽动他们的孩子做这种事。他们说，父母这样做，在很小的时候就毁灭了孩子们从主那里获得的所有的互爱和所有的纯真，激发他们进入仇恨和报复的灵人。因此，他们用自己的努力把自己的孩子关在了天堂之外，因为天堂里只有互爱。所以，要让那些希望自己的孩子幸福的父母谨防这样的事情。</p>
<p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>344. 由此可见孩子的教育在天堂是什么样, 即: 他们通过对真理的理解和关于良善的智慧被引入天使的生命, 而天使的生命就在于含有纯真在里面的对主之爱和相爱. 从下面的例子可以看出尘世孩子的教育在很多情况下何等不同. 在一座大城市的街道上, 我看见一些小男孩在互相打架; 一群人聚集在周围看得津津有味; 我被告知, 小男孩便在自己父母的鼓动下参与这样的打架. 透过我的眼睛目睹这一切的善灵和天使对此如此厌恶, 以致我能感觉到他们的不寒而栗; 特别是父母竟然鼓励这种行为. 他们说, 父母这样做, 会早早地毁掉孩子从主所获得的一切相爱和一切纯真, 把他们引入仇恨和报复. 因此, 他们通过自己的故意行为把自己的孩子关在天堂之外, 因为天堂只有相爱. 所以, 要让祝福自己孩子的父母们谨防这种事. </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>344. 由此可知天國的孩子是如何被養育成人的。通過領會真理, 覺悟良善, 他們被引入天人般的生活, 該生活由愛主及彼此相愛構成, 有天真在其中。<br><br>讓我舉一個例子, 以說明世上的孩子在很多情況下是如何被撫養成人的。在一座大城市的街道上, 我看到一群男孩在打架。周圍聚集了不少人, 正饒有興致的圍觀。我被告知, 孩子的父母也在其中, 正給自己的孩子加油打氣。透過我雙眼看到這情景的善靈和天人不忍直觀。我感覺到他們的震驚, 特別是孩子的父母竟鼓勵他們的行為。他們說這樣做, 將在孩子年幼時即扼殺從主所受彼此相愛, 天真無邪的性情, 把他們引入仇恨和報復的泥淖中。因自己有意識的行為, 將孩子關在天國的門外, 因為天國是彼此相愛的地方。願每位真為自己兒女著想的父母, 都引以為戒。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #344 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>344. We may gather from this what the upbringing of children is like in heaven - through an understanding of truth and a wisdom about what is good, they are led into an angelic life, which consists of love for the Lord and a mutual love in which there is innocence. <br><br>An example may serve to illustrate how different the upbringing of children on earth is in many instances. I was on the street of a large city and saw some boys fighting with each other. A crowd gathered and watched this with great delight, and I was told that the parents themselves urged their children into fights like these. The good spirits and angels who were seeing all this through my eyes were so repelled that I could feel them shudder, especially at the fact that the parents were encouraging this kind of behavior. They said that by doing this they would at the very earliest age stifle all the mutual love and all the innocence that little ones receive from the Lord and lead them into hatred and vindictiveness. So by their own deliberate practices they would shut their children out of heaven, where there is nothing but mutual love. Let any parents who wish well for their children beware of things like this. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #344 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p> 344. From the things stated, it can be confirmed what the education of little children is in heaven, namely, that it is leading them by means of an understanding of truth and the wisdom of good into the angelic life, which is love to the Lord and mutual love, in which is innocence. But how different in many cases is the education of little children on the earth can be seen from this example. I was in the street of a large city, and saw little boys fighting with each other; a crowd flocked around and looked on with much pleasure; and I was told that little boys are incited to such fights by their own parents. Good spirits and angels who saw this through my eyes were so revolted at it that I felt their horror, and especially that parents should incite their children to such things, saying that in this way parents extinguish in the earliest age all the mutual love and all the innocence that little children have from the Lord, and initiate them into hatred and revenge. Consequently, by their own endeavours they shut their children out of heaven, where there is nothing but mutual love. Let parents therefore who wish well to their children beware of such things. </p><p align="center">------------</p>

<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #344 (original Latin)</h4><p>344. Ex his quae allata sunt constare potest, qualis est educatio infantum in caelo; nempe quod per intelligentiam veri et sapientiam boni introducantur in vitam angelicam, quae est amor in Dominum et amor mutuus, in quibus est innocentia. Sed quam contraria est educatio infantum in terra apud plures, constare potest ab hoc exemplo. Eram in platea urbis magnae, et vidi puerulos inter se dimicantes; affluebat turba quae hoc multa voluptate aspectabat; et instructus sum, quod ipsi parentes excitent puerulos liberos ad tales pugnas. Spiritus boni et angeli, qui illa per oculos meos videbant, illa ita aversabantur, ut horrorem perciperem, et maxime ex eo, quod parentes eos ad talia incitent; dicentes, quod sic in prima aetate exstinguant omnem amorem mutuum, et omnem innocentiam, quae infantibus a Domino, et illos in odia et vindictas initient: consequenter quod liberos suos suo studio ex caelo excludant, ubi nihil nisi amor mutuus. Caveant itaque a talibus parentes, qui liberis suis bonum volunt. </p>
