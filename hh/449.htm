<h3 align="center" class="ired">《天堂与地狱》 第449节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>449、我被带入身体感官失去知觉的状态，接近垂死的状态，但我的内在生命和思想却没有受到影响，为了让我能感知并记住发生在我身上的事，也就是发生在那些从死里复苏之人身上的事。我觉察到身体的呼吸几乎完全消失了，而灵的内在的呼吸仍在继续，与身体的轻微而默契的呼吸相联系。这时，我的心跳首先与属天的国度建立了沟通，因为属天的国度对应于人的心脏。<a href="#a479">｛注1｝</a>又看见来自该国度的天使，有的在远处，但有两位靠近我的头坐着。因此，尽管思想和感知还在继续，我自己的所有感情都被带走了。<br><br>
[2]我在这种状态下呆了几个小时。然后，我周围的灵人以为我已经死了，逐渐离开。我闻到一股好像防腐尸体的芳香，因为当属天的天使在场时，尸体的一切闻上去都是芳香的。灵人闻到这香味就无法靠近，当人正被引入永生时，用这种方法让恶灵远离此人的灵。坐在我头边的天使静默无声，只是与我分享他们的想法，当他们的想法被接受时，天使们知道这个人的灵已经处在被引导出身体的状态。他们通过看着我的脸来完成思想的分享，这实际上是在天堂里分享思想的方式。<br><br>
[3]由于我的思想和感知仍在，以便让我知道并记住复苏是如何实现的。我感知到，天使首先试图确定我的思想是什么，它是不是像那些垂死之人的思想，这通常是关于永生。他们希望将我的心思保持在这些思想中。后来我被告知，当身体气绝时，人的灵就被保持在他最后的思想中，直到它回到从他在尘世时的基本（或主导）情感中流出的思想中。尤其特别的是，我蒙允许看见和感觉到一股拉力，可以说是将我心智的内层，也就是我的灵，从身体中牵拉出来。我被告知，这是出于主，复苏就是这样实现的。<br><br>
<a name="a479">｛注1｝</a>：心脏对应于主的属天国度，肺对应于祂的属灵国度（<a href="../ac/3635.htm">3635</a>，<a href="../ac/3886.htm">3886</a>，<a href="../ac/3887.htm">3887</a>）。</p>
<p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>449. 我被带入肉体感官失去知觉的状态, 和濒死之人的状态差不多. 然而, 我的内在生命和思维依旧完好无损, 以便我能察觉发生在我, 以及那些从死里复活之人身上的事, 并将其保留在记忆中. 我注意到我肉体的呼吸几乎完全停止, 而灵的呼吸仍在继续, 伴随着极其微弱而静默的肉体呼吸. 然后一开始, 我的心跳与属天国度建立起联系, 因为属天国度对应于人的心脏. 我还看见来自该国度的天使, 有的在远处, 但有两位坐在我脑袋旁边, 结果带走了我自己的全部情感, 只让我拥有思维和觉知.<br><br>我在这种状态下呆了几个小时. 然后我周围的灵人逐渐退去, 以为我已经死了. 我闻到一股防腐尸体的香味, 因为当属天天使在场时, 属于尸体的一切闻上去都很香. 灵人闻到这香味后就无法靠近. 当人正被引入永生时, 恶灵便以这种方式远离他的灵. 坐在我脑袋旁边的天使静默无声, 只是将他们的思维与我的进行共享; 当他们的思维被接受时, 天使便知道人的灵处于能从肉体被引出来的状态. 其思维的这种共享通过注视我的脸实现, 因为在天堂, 思维就是以这种方式进行共享的.<br><br>由于我的思维和觉知仍在继续, 好叫我知道并记住复活是如何发生的, 所以我注意到, 天使首先试图确定我的思维是什么, 它是不是那些濒死之人的思维, 因为濒死之人通常思想永生. 他们想将我的心智保持在这些思维中. 后来我被告知, 当肉体气绝时, 人的灵就被保持在它最后的思维中, 直到它最终回到从它在世时的基本或主导情感所流出的思维中. 尤其是, 我蒙允许看见并感受到一股拉力, 可以说将我心智的内层, 因而将我的灵从肉体当中牵引出来; 我被告知, 这一切都是主做的, 复活就这样发生了.<br><br>注: 心脏对应于主的属天国度, 肺脏对应于祂的属灵国度(<a href="../ac/3635.htm">天国的奥秘 3635</a>, <a href="../ac/3886.htm">3886</a>, <a href="../ac/3887.htm">3887</a>节). </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>449. 我被帶入肉體失去知覺, 如同瀕死之人的狀態。但是, 我內在的生命和思想始終絲毫未損, 好叫我察覺並記憶所發生的一切, 也就是從死裡蘇醒的經過。我注意到肉體的呼吸幾近停頓, 但是有一種深沉的呼吸, 即靈魂的呼吸, 正在繼續, 伴隨著十分微弱而寂靜的肉體的呼吸。<br><br>彼時, 在我的心跳和仁智天國之間建立了聯繫, 因為仁智天國與心對應。我看見天國的天人, 有的在遠處, 有兩位坐在枕邊。其作用是帶走我全部的情感, 留下想法和認知。我在此狀態下有幾個時辰。<br><br>然後, 我周圍的靈逐漸退去, 認為我是死了。我聞到一股香味, 正如用於屍體防腐香料的芳香。有仁智天人在場時, 與屍體相關的一切都會發出芳香氣味。靈察覺此味時, 無法靠近屍體。人進入來生時, 惡靈也因此不能靠近人的靈。<br><br>坐在枕邊的天人一直默默無聲, 只是與我交流思想。(一旦天人的思想被死者接收時, 天人就知道死者的靈魂可被引出肉體了。)天人通過注視我的臉來與我交流思想, 這正是天人交流思想的方式。<br><br>由於我保有思維和認識, 好叫我明白並記住蘇醒的過程。我注意到, 天人首先要確認我的想法是否與瀕死之人相同(他們通常會想到生命的永恆), 也希望我保持這種念頭。後來我被告知, 當肉體作最後一次呼吸時, 靈魂被保持那一刻的想法, 直到恢復世間形成的主導欲或基本情感。<br><br>特別的是, 我還能察覺並感受到一股拉力, 將我的內在心智, 也就是我的靈, 從肉體中牽引出來。我被告知, 這是主的作為, 復活就這樣發生了。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #449 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>449. I was brought into a state in which my physical senses were inoperative - very much, then, like the state of people who are dying. However, my deeper life and thought remained intact so that I could perceive and retain what was happening to me and what does happen to people who are being awakened from death. I noticed that my physical breathing was almost suspended, with a deeper breathing, a breathing of the spirit, continuing along with a very slight and silent physical one. <br><br>At first then a connection was established between my heartbeat and the heavenly kingdom, because that kingdom corresponds to the human heart. <sup>1</sup>I also saw angels from that kingdom, some at a distance, but two sitting close to my head. The effect was to take away all my own affection but to leave me in possession of thought and perception.<p> </p><p>[2] I remained in this state for several hours. <br><br>Then the spirits who were around me gradually drew away, thinking that I was dead. I sensed a sweet odor like that of an embalmed body, for when heavenly angels are present anything having to do with a corpse smells sweet. When spirits sense this, they cannot come near. This is also how evil spirits are kept away from our spirit when we are being admitted into eternal life. <br><br>The angels who were sitting beside my head were silent, simply sharing their thoughts with mine (when these are accepted [by the deceased], the angels know that the person's spirit is ready to be led out of the body). They accomplished this sharing of thoughts by looking into my face. This is actually how thoughts are shared in heaven.<p> </p><p>[3] Since I had been left in possession of thought and perception so that I could learn and remember how awakening happens, I noticed that at first the angels were checking to see whether my thoughts were like those of dying individuals, who are normally thinking about eternal life. They wanted to keep my mind in these thoughts. I was later told that as the body is breathing its last, our spirit is kept in its final thought until eventually it comes back to the thoughts that flowed from our basic or ruling affection in the world. <br><br>Especially, I was enabled to perceive and even to feel that there was a pull, a kind of drawing out of the deeper levels of my mind and therefore of my spirit from my body; and I was told that this was being done by the Lord and is what brings about our resurrection. <br><br><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br><div><p>1.&nbsp;The heart corresponds to the Lord's heavenly kingdom and the lungs to his spiritual kingdom: <a href="../ac/3635.htm">3635</a>, <a href="../ac/3886.htm">3886-3887</a>. </p></div><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #449 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p>449. As to the senses of the body I was brought into a state of insensibility, thus nearly into the state of the dying, but with the interior life and thought remaining unimpaired, in order that I might perceive and retain in the memory the things that happened to me, and that happen to those who are resuscitated from the dead. I perceived that the respiration of the body was almost wholly taken away; but the interior respiration of the spirit went on in connection with a slight and tacit respiration of the body. Then at first a communication of the pulse of the heart with the celestial kingdom was established, because that kingdom corresponds to the heart in man. <sup>1</sup>Angels from that kingdom were seen, some at a distance, and two sitting near my head. Thus all my own affection was taken away although thought and perception continued. <p> </p><p>[2] I was in this state for some hours. Then the spirits who were around me withdrew, supposing that I was dead; and an aromatic odour like that of an embalmed body was perceived, for when the celestial angels are present everything pertaining to the corpse is perceived as aromatic, and when spirits perceive this they cannot approach; and in this way evil spirits are kept away from man's spirit when he is being introduced into eternal life. The angels seated at my head were silent, merely sharing their thoughts with mine; and when their thoughts are received, the angels know that the spirit of man is in a state in which it can be drawn forth from the body. This sharing of their thoughts was effected by looking into my face, for in this way in heaven thoughts are shared. <p> </p><p>[3] As thought and perception remained with me, that I might know and remember how resuscitation is effected, I perceived that the angels first tried to ascertain what my thought was, whether it was like the thought of those who are dying, which is usually about eternal life; also that they wished to keep my mind in that thought. Afterwards, I was told that the spirit of man is held in its last thought when the body expires, until it returns to the thoughts that are from its general or ruling affection in the world. Especially was I permitted to see and feel that there was a pulling and drawing forth, as it were, of the interiors of my mind, thus of my spirit, from the body; and I was told that this is from the Lord, and that the resurrection is thus effected. <br><br><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br><div><p>1.&nbsp;The heart corresponds to the Lord's celestial kingdom, the lungs to His spiritual kingdom (<a href="../ac/3635.htm">Arcana Coelestia 3635</a>, <a href="../ac/3886.htm">3886-3887</a>). </p></div><p align="center">------------</p>

<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #449 (original Latin)</h4><p>449. In statum insensibilitatis quoad corporeos sensus perductus sum, ita paene in statum morientium, manente tamen interiore vita integra cum cogitatione, ut perciperem et memoria retinerem illa quae contingerent, et quae contingunt illis qui e mortuis resuscitantur. Percepi quod paene adempta esset respiratio corporis, remanente respiratione interiore quae spiritus, conjuncta cum tenui et tacita corporis. Primum tunc data est communicatio quoad pulsum cordis cum regno caelesti, quoniam id regnum correspondet cordi apud hominem: <sup>1</sup>visi etiam sunt angeli inde, aliquot e longinquo, et bini prope caput cui assidebant; inde omnis affectio propria ablata est, sed usque permanebat cogitatio et perceptio;<br><br> <br>[2] in hoc statu eram per aliquot horas. Spiritus tunc, qui circum me fuerunt, se removebant, autumantes quod mortuus essem; sentitus <sup>2</sup>etiam est odor aromaticus, sicut cadaveris conditi; nam cum angeli caelestes adsunt, tunc cadaverosum sentitur ut aromaticum, quem cum spiritus sentiunt, non possunt appropinquare; ita quoque arcentur mali spiritus a spiritu hominis, cum primum introducitur in vitam aeternam. Angeli, qui assidebant capiti, taciti erant, modo communicantes sua cogitata cum meis quae cum recipiuntur, sciunt angeli quod spiritus hominis in eo statu sit, ut educi e corpore possit. Communicatio cogitationum eorum fiebat per aspectum in faciem meam; sic enim in caelo fiunt cogitationum communicationes. Quia mihi relicta est cogitatio et perceptio, ob causam ut scirem et reminiscerer quomodo resuscitatio fit, percipiebam quod angeli illi primum inquirerent quae cogitatio mea esset, num similis illorum qui moriuntur, quae solet esse de vita aeterna, et quod in illa cogitatione vellent tenere mentem meam. Dictum est postea, quod hominis spiritus in cogitatione sua ultima, cum exspirat corpus, teneatur eo usque, dum ad cogitationes, quae sunt ex affectione sua communi seu regnante in mundo, redit.
