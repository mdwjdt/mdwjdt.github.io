<h3 align="center" class="ired">《天堂与地狱》 第505节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>505、当灵人处在其内层状态时，他在世上时真正是怎样的人就显而易见了，因为在这个时候，他出于他的自我行事。在世上内心良善的人，此时行事理性、智慧，甚至比在世时更智慧，因为他已经与身体、因而与尘世的事物断了联系，这些尘世的事物像云一样造成干涉和模糊。但那些在世上处在邪恶中的人则行事愚蠢疯狂，甚至比在世时还要疯狂，因为他自由了，不再受约束。因为当他活在世上时，他表面是理智的，通过外表他让自己看起来是一个理性的人，但当他的外在被剥去后，他内在的疯狂就显露出来了。外表像好人的恶人好比一个器皿，外面闪闪发亮，盖着盖子，里面却藏有各种各样的污秽，正如主所说的：<br><br>
你们好像粉饰的坟墓，外表华美，里面却装满了死人的骨头和一切的污秽。（<a href="http://www.39-27.cn/太23.37.htm">马太福音23:27</a>）</p>
<p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>505. 当灵处于其内层状态时, 他在世时究竟是哪种人, 就会变得显而易见. 事实上, 在这种时候, 他照自己的本性行事. 在世上从内在处于良善的人此时行事理性, 智慧, 甚至比在世时更智慧, 因为他与肉体, 因而与那些如同一层云那样造成模糊, 遮蔽的尘世事物断了联系. 相反, 在世上陷入邪恶的人此时行事却愚蠢, 疯狂, 甚至比在世时还要疯狂, 因为他自由了, 不再受约束. 只要活在世上, 他表面上是明智的, 因为他利用外在使自己表现得像个理性人. 但当他被剥去外在时, 其内在疯狂就暴露出来. 外在伪装成善人的恶人好比一个坛子, 外面抛光闪亮, 还盖上盖子, 里面却藏有各种污秽, 正如主所说的:<br><br>你们好像粉饰的坟墓, 外面好看, 里面却装满了死人的骨头和一切的污秽. (<a href="3927/matthew_23_27.htm">马太福音 23:27</a>) </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>505. 當靈進入內在的狀態以後, 他在人間真正為人如何就顯明出來了, 事實上, 他將完全照自己的秉性而行。在世時曾專注於善者將照理性智慧而行, 事實上, 將比在人間時更有智慧, 因為他已脫去那如雲層遮蔽靈性的肉體。<br><br>反之, 在世時曾沉迷於惡者將表現得愚癡瘋狂, 事實上, 將比在人間時更加瘋狂, 因為他已獲得自由, 不再受到約束。在世之時, 他們顯得很有理智, 因為這是他們模仿理智之人的方式。所以, 當外在的層面剝離以後, 其內在的瘋狂就暴露了出來。<br><br>假冒為善的惡人好比一個外表光亮, 裡面卻藏著各種啟穢的罎子, 正如主說:"你們好像粉飾的墳墓, 外面好看, 裡面卻裝滿了死人的骨頭和一切的啟穢。"(<a href="3927/matthew_23_27.htm">馬太福音23:27</a>) </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #505 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>505. When spirits are in this state of their deeper concerns, then it is obvious what kind of people they really were in the world. They actually behave in accord with their own nature. People who were inwardly devoted to the good in the world then behave sanely and wisely, more wisely than when they were living in the world, in fact, because they have been freed from any connection with the body and therefore with the earthly things that darken and cover with a kind of cloud. <br><br>In contrast, people who were focused on evil in the world then behave foolishly and insanely, more insanely than when they were in the world, in fact, because they are in freedom and are no longer constrained. As long as they were living in the world, they were outwardly sensible, because this was how they imitated rational people. So when the outer layers are stripped off, their inner insanity is unveiled. <br><br>An evil person who outwardly pretends to be good can be compared to a brightly polished jar with a cover on, with all kinds of filth hidden inside, just as the Lord said: "You are like whitewashed sepulchers that look lovely on the outside but are inwardly full of the bones of the dead and all uncleanness" (<a href="3927/matthew_23_27.htm">Matthew 23:27</a>). </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #505 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p> 505. When the spirit is in the state of his interiors it becomes clearly evident what the man was in himself when he was in the world, for at such times he acts from his proprium. He who was in the world interiorly in good then acts rationally and wisely, and even more wisely than in the world, because he is released from connection with the body, and thus from those earthly things that caused obscurity and interposed, as it were, a cloud. But he who was in evil in the world then acts foolishly and insanely, and even more insanely than in the world, because he is free and under no restraint. For while he lived in the world he was sane in externals, since by means of externals he made himself appear to be a rational man; but when he has been stripped of his externals his insanities are revealed. An evil man who in externals takes on the semblance of a good man may be likened to a vessel shining and polished on the outside and covered with a lid, within which, filth of all kinds is hidden, in accordance with the Lord's saying: <br><br>Ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which outwardly appear beautiful, but inwardly are full of dead men's bones and of all uncleanness. <a href="3927/matthew_23_27.htm">Matthew 23:27</a>. </p><p align="center">------------</p>

<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #505 (original Latin)</h4><p>505. Cum spiritus in statu interiorum suorum est, tunc patet manifeste qualis homo in se fuit in mundo, agit enim tunc ex proprio suo; qui interius in bono fuit in mundo, is tunc rationaliter et sapienter agit, immo tunc sapientius quam in mundo, quia solutus est a nexu cum corpore, et inde cum terrestribus, quae obscurarunt et quasi nubem interposuerunt. Qui autem in malo fuit in mundo, is tunc insipide et insane agit, immo insanius quam in mundo, quia in libero est, et non coercetur: cum enim in mundo vixit, sanus fuit in externis, nam per illa finxit hominem rationalem; quare cum externa illi ablata sunt, revelantur insaniae ejus. Malus, qui in externis effigiat bonum hominem, comparari potest vasi exterius nitido et polito, ac tecto velamine, intra quod reconditae sunt omnis generis spurcities, et secundum Domini effatum,<br><br>"Similes estis sepulcris dealbatis, quae foris apparent speciosa, intus vero plena sunt ossibus mortuorum, et omni immunditie," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_505/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_23_27" target=_top>Matthaeus 23:27</a>). </p>
