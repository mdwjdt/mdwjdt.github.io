<h3 align="center" class="ired">《天堂与地狱》 第519节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>519、当灵人在上述场所接受教导、为天堂做好准备后（时间很短，因为他们在属灵的观念中，能同时理解很多细节），他们就穿上天使的衣服，大多洁白发光，好像细麻布做的；然后，他们被带到通往天堂的路上，被送到守护天使那里；随后，他们被其他天使接受，并被介绍给多个社群，在那里得到众多的祝福。在这之后，每个人都被主引导，进入他自己的社群，这也会通过各种方式来实现，有时会经过蜿蜒曲折的路程。没有天使知道他们当走的路，唯有主知道。当他们来到自己的社群后，内层就被打开，由于这些内层与该社群天使的内层相符，他们马上被认出并被欢欢喜喜地接纳。</p>
<p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>519. 当灵人通过在上述场所接受教导而为天堂做好准备后(这种准备不会花很长时间, 因为他们处于属灵的观念, 这种观念可同时有效涵盖许多不同的观念), 他们就穿上天使的衣服, 这些衣服大多洁白发光, 像细麻制成的; 他们就这样被带到通往天堂的路上, 被交给那里的守护天使. 后来他们被其他天使接受, 并被引入社群和那里的众多祝福. 此后, 主将每位天使引入各自的社群, 这种事也是通过各种方式实现的, 有时会通过迂回的路径. 任何天使都不知道他们被引领所走的路, 这些路唯有主知道. 当他们来到自己的社群时, 其内层就被打开; 由于这些内层与该社群天使的内层和谐一致, 所以他们立刻被认出, 并被欢喜接纳. </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>519. 靈在受教場所為天國做好準備以後(時間不會很長, 因為憑心靈之念, 一時可領會很多), 就穿上天人的衣服(通常是潔白的細麻衣), 然後被帶到通往天國的路上, 交給守護天人。他們受到天人的歡迎, 被引入眾多社群當中, 得到他們的祝福。此後, 主將每位天人帶入各自的社群。該過程通過多種途徑完成, 有時經過迂回曲折的路程。天人不知他們當走的路, 唯有主知。他們到達自己的社群以後, 內在秉性就被打開。就內在秉性而言, 他們與所屬社群的成員是和諧一致的。所以, 他們立時被認出, 並受到熱烈的歡迎。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #519 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>519. After spirits have been prepared for heaven in these learning sites (which does not take long, because they are surrounded by spiritual concepts that comprehend a great deal at once), they are dressed in angelic clothing, usually white as linen, taken to a path that leads up toward heaven, and turned over to guardian angels there. Then they are accepted by other angels and put in touch with their communities and with a host of blessings. The Lord then takes each angel to her or his community. This happens in various ways, sometimes with detours. No angel knows the paths along which they are taken, only the Lord. When they arrive at their own communities, their inner natures are opened, and since they are in harmony with the inner natures of the angels who are members of that community, they are recognized instantly and accepted with joy. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #519 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p> 519. When spirits have been prepared for heaven by instruction in the places above described, which is effected in a short time on account of their being in spiritual ideas that comprehend many particulars together, they are clothed with angelic garments, which are mostly glowing white as if made of fine linen; and they are thus brought to the way that leads upwards towards heaven, and are delivered there to angel guards, and afterwards are received by other angels and introduced into societies and into many blessednesses there. After this, each one is led by the Lord into his own society, which is also effected by various ways, sometimes by winding paths. The ways by which they are led are not known to any angel, but are known to the Lord alone. When they come to their own society then their interiors are opened; and as these are in conformity with the interiors of the angels who are in that society they are immediately recognized and received with joy. </p><p align="center">------------</p>

<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #519 (original Latin)</h4><p>519. Postquam spiritus in locis supradictis per instructiones praeparati sunt ad caelum, quod fit intra breve tempus, ex causa quia in spiritualibus ideis sunt, quae plura simul comprehendunt, tunc induuntur vestibus angelicis, quae plerumque candidae sunt sicut ex bysso, et sic feruntur ad viam quae sursum tendit ad coelum, ac traduntur angelis custodibus ibi, et dein recipiuntur ab aliis angelis, ac in societates introducuntur, et in plures ibi faustitates. Quisque dein in suam societatem a Domino fertur; quod etiam fit per varias vias, quandoque per ambages. Vias, per quas ducuntur, nullus angelus scit, sed solus Dominus. Cum ad suam societatem veniunt, tunc aperiuntur interiora eorum, quae quia conformia sunt interioribus angelorum, qui in illa societate sunt, ideo agnoscuntur illico, et cum gaudio recipiuntur. </p>
