<h4 align="center"></h4><p>335、孩子们主要通过适合其能力的形像来接受教导。这些形像既漂亮、可爱，又从内在充满了智慧，令人难以置信。用这种方法，将本质上源自良善的智力逐渐灌输给他们。在此举两个我被允许看到的例子，由此可以推断其它形像的性质。首先，有一个主从坟墓里复活的形像，同时，其人身与神性合而为一。这一切以如此智慧的方式完成，以至于超越所有人类的智慧，同时又带着孩子般的纯真。坟墓的概念被呈现出来，一起被表现出来的还有对主的概念，只是看似遥远，以至于觉察不到主在那里，仿佛祂在远处。这是因为坟墓的概念中有悲哀的意味，用这种方法将它除去。然后，某种看似薄薄烟雾的气状物被小心谨慎地引入坟墓，这一切连同适当的距离，表示洗礼所代表的属灵生命。后来，我看见天使们以无比的谨慎和温柔表现主降临到被掳（“捆绑”）的人那里，与他们一同升入天堂。为适应孩子们的心智，他们放下了几乎看不见的细绳，非常柔软和温柔，通过这些细绳照亮主的上升之路。整个过程充满神圣的呵护，以免形像中有什么东西触及属灵和属天事物以外的东西。还有其它吸引孩子们的表现形式，如适合孩子们心智的表演，通过这些表演，他们被引入对真理的认知和对良善的情感中。</p>

<p>335. 孩子主要通过适合其性质的代表或图像接受教导, 这些代表或图像既漂亮, 可爱, 又从内在充满智慧, 令人难以置信. 从良善得其灵魂的聪明便以这种方式逐渐被注入他们. 在此我举两个亲眼目睹的例子, 由此可推断其它代表或图像的性质. 首先, 主被表现为从坟墓里复活, 同时其人身与神性合而为一. 这一切以如此智慧的方式完成, 以至于超越所有人的智慧, 同时又带有孩子般的纯真. 坟墓的概念被表现出来, 与它一起被表现出来的, 还有对主的概念, 只是以如此遥远的方式, 以致人拿不准那就是主, 仿佛他在远处. 这是因为坟墓的概念含有死亡的意味, 这种意味便以这种方式被除去. 然后, 某种看似薄薄水蒸汽的大气状的事物被小心谨慎地引入坟墓, 这一切连同适当的距离表示洗礼所代表的属灵生命. 后来, 我又看见天使以无比的温柔和崇敬表现主降到被掳的人那里, 与他们一同升入天堂(<a href="3927/psalms_68_18.htm">诗篇 68:18</a>; <a href="3927/ephesians_4_8.htm">以弗所书 4:8</a>–10; <a href="3927/1-peter_3_19.htm">彼得前书 3:19</a>–20). 为适应孩子理解事物的方式, 有小小的绳索被垂下来, 几不可见, 柔软纤细, 支撑着主上升. 整个过程充满神圣的敬畏, 以免代表或图像中有什么东西触及任何不包含属灵和属天之物的事物. 还有其它赋予孩子的代表, 如适合孩子心智的表演; 通过这些表演, 他们被引入对真理的认知和对良善的情感. </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>335. 孩子主要通過適合其秉性的意象受教, 這些意象引人入勝, 充滿智慧。通過這種方式, 他們逐漸被灌以本乎良善的智慧。在此我舉兩個親眼目睹的實例, 以作說明。<br><br>首先, 主被表現為從墳墓裡復活, 其人性與神性合而為一。畫面以十分智慧地方式呈現, 完全超越人間的智慧, 同時又不失孩子的天真。墳墓的概念被表現出來, 主在其中, 但表現得相當隱晦, 以致人難以想到是主, 仿佛他在遠處。墳墓既意味著死亡, 他們便以此方式來消除死亡的意味。之後, 有朦朧的水氣狀的東西進入墳墓, 代表洗禮所象徵的靈性的生命, 這同樣通過適當的距離來表現。<br><br>然後我看到主被表現為下到監牢, 將其中的俘虜帶入天國, 該畫面以十分莊重, 敬畏的方式呈現出來。讓孩子容易理解的是, 有小小的繩索垂下來, 幾不可見, 柔軟纖細, 支撐著主升天。整個過程充滿令人敬畏的氣氛, 以免流為屬靈屬天之外的事物。<br><br>還有其它吸引孩子的表現形式, 比如適合孩子心智的戲劇。通過這些戲劇, 他們被引導而領悟真理, 熱愛良善。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #335 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>335. Children are taught especially by images suited to their natures, images that are unbelievably lovely and full of wisdom from within. In this way, there is gradually instilled into them an intelligence that derives its essence from goodness. I may cite at this point two examples I have been allowed to see that will serve to suggest the nature of the rest. <br><br>At first, the Lord was pictured rising from the tomb, and along with this, the uniting of his human nature with his divine nature. This was done in such a wise manner as to surpass all human wisdom, but at the same time with a childlike innocence. The idea of a tomb was presented, but with the Lord present only so remotely that one could hardly tell that it was the Lord, as though he were far off. This was because there is a sense of death in the notion of a tomb, which they were removing by this means. Then something ethereal, something that looked faint and watery was carefully let into the tomb, referring to the spiritual life represented by baptism, again from a proper distance. <br><br>Then I saw a representation of the Lord coming down to the captives and rising with the captives into heaven, presented with incomparable care and reverence. The childlike aspect of this was that little cords were let down, almost invisible, as soft and delicate as possible, which supported the Lord in his ascent. Throughout it all, there was a holy fear lest anything in the images should touch on a matter in which there was not something spiritual and heavenly. <br><br>There were other representations that engaged the children as well - for example, plays suited to the minds of children - through which they were led into awareness of truth and affections for what is good. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #335 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p> 335. Little children are taught chiefly by representatives suited to their genius. These are beautiful and at the same time full of wisdom from within, beyond all belief. In this way, an intelligence that derives its soul from good is gradually instilled into them. It is permitted here to describe two representatives that I have been enabled to see, from which a conclusion can be made about the rest. First, they were representing the Lord rising from the sepulchre, and at the same time the uniting of His Human with the Divine. This was done in a manner so wise as to surpass all human wisdom, and at the same time in an innocent infantile manner. They were presenting also an idea of the sepulchre, and with it an idea of the Lord, but in so remote a way that it could scarcely be perceived that the Lord was there, except seemingly afar off. This was because in the idea of a sepulchre there is something funereal, and they were removing it in this way. Afterwards, they cautiously admitted into the sepulchre something atmospheric, with an appearance of thin vapour, by which with proper remoteness they signified spiritual life in baptism. Afterwards, I saw a representation, by these angels, of the Lord descending to those who are bound, and of His ascending with these into heaven, and this with incomparable prudence and reverence. In adaptation to the infantile mind they let down little cords almost invisible, very soft and tender, by which they eased the Lord's ascent, always with a holy solicitude that there should be nothing in the representation bordering upon anything that did not contain what is spiritual celestial. Other representations are there given, whereby, as by plays adapted to the minds of children, they are guided into cognitions of truth and affections of good. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #335 (Ager, 1900)</h4><p>335. Children are taught chiefly by representatives suited to their capacity. These are beautiful and full of wisdom from within, beyond all belief. In this way an intelligence that derives its soul from good is gradually instilled into them. I will here describe two representatives that I have been permitted to see, from which the nature of others may be inferred. First there was a representation of the Lord's rising from the sepulchre, and at the same time of the uniting of His Human with the Divine. This was done in a manner so wise as to surpass all human wisdom, and at the same time in an innocent infantile manner. An idea of a sepulchre was presented, and with it an idea of the Lord, but in so remote a way that there was scarcely any perception of its being the Lord, except seemingly afar off; and for the reason that in the idea of a sepulchre there is something funereal, and this was thus removed, afterwards they cautiously admitted into the sepulchre something atmospheric, with an appearance of thin vapor, by which with proper remoteness they signified spiritual life in baptism. Afterwards I saw a representation by the angels of the Lord's descent to those that are "bound," and of His ascent with these into heaven, and this with incomparable prudence and gentleness. In adaptation to the infantile mind they let down little cords almost invisible, very soft and tender, by which they lightened the Lord's ascent, always with a holy solicitude that there should be nothing in the representation bordering upon anything that did not contain what is spiritual and heavenly. Other representations are there given, whereby, as by plays adapted to the minds of children, they are guided into knowledges of truth and affections for good. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #335 (original Latin)</h4><p>335. Instruuntur infantes imprimis per repraesentativa geniis eorum adaequata quae quam pulchra, et simul sapientia ab interiori plena sunt, nusquam aliquis credere potest: ita illis insinuatur per gradus intelligentia, quae suam animam trahit a bono. Bina repraesentativa, quae videre datum est, licet hic referre, ex quibus concludi potest ad reliqua. Primum repraesentabant Dominum e sepulcro ascendentem, et simul Humani Ipsius unitionem cum Divino; quod fiebat modo tam sapiente, ut excederet omnem sapientiam humanam, et simul modo innocente infantili. Sistebant etiam ideam sepulcri, sed non simul ideam Domini nisi ita remote ut vix perciperetur quod Dominus, nisi quasi e longinquo; ex causa quia ideae sepulcri inest aliquid funeris, quod sic removebant. Postea admittebant prudenter in sepulcrum quoddam atmosphaericum apparens usque ut tenue aqueum, quo significabant, etiam per remotionem decentem, vitam spiritualem in Baptismo. Postea vidi repraesentari ab iis Domini descensum ad vinctos, et ascensum cum vinctis in caelum, et hoc incomparabili prudentia et pietate et quod infantile erat, funiculos fere inconspicuos, molliusculos et tenerrimos demittebant, quibus Dominum allevarent in ascensu; semper in sancto timore, ne quicquam in repraesentativo attingeret aliquid in quo non spirituale caeleste. Praeter alia repraesentativa, in quibus sunt, et per quae in cognitiones veri et affectiones boni, sicut per ludos infantum animis conformes, perducuntur. </p>
