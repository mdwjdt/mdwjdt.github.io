<h3 align="center" class="ired">《天堂与地狱》 第452节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>452、我曾与一些死了三天的人交谈过，当时，前文（<a href="../hh/449.htm">449</a>-<a href="../hh/450.htm">450</a>）所描述的过程已经发生。我也与三位我在世上认识的人交谈，并告诉他们，正在做准备，以便埋葬他们的尸体。当听到我在说“这是为了埋葬他们”时，他们被惊到了，说他们仍活着，将要埋葬的只是曾在尘世为他们服务的东西。后来，他们感到非常奇怪，活在肉身时，他们竟然不相信死后的这种生命，尤其是教会里也几乎没人相信。<br><br>
有些人在世时，不相信肉体的生命结束后还有任何灵魂的生命。当他们发现自己还活着的时候，感到非常羞愧。然而，那些坚定地不相信的人寻求与他们的同类会合，并远离那些有信仰的人。这些不相信的人绝大多数都附属于地狱社群，因为他们还否认上帝，鄙视教会的真理。因为人越是坚定地反对灵魂的永生，也就越坚定地反对属于天堂和教会的事物。</p>
<p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>452. 我曾与一些死后三天的人交谈过, 当时前面(<a href="../ac/449.htm">天国的奥秘 449-450</a>节)所描述的过程已经完成. 我特别与三位我在尘世所认识的人交谈, 并告诉他们说, 他们的葬礼正在筹备, 好埋葬他们的肉体. 当听我说这是为埋葬他们时, 他们被惊到了, 声称他们仍活着, 将要埋葬的只是在尘世曾服务于他们的物质. 后来, 他们极其惊讶地发现, 活在肉身时, 他们一直不相信死后的这种生命, 尤为惊讶的是, 教会里竟也没几个人相信它. 有些人在世时不相信肉体生命结束后灵魂还有生命存在, 当发现自己仍活着时, 感到十分尴尬. 然而, 那些确认这种不信的人便寻求加入他们的同类, 并远离活在信仰中的人. 他们绝大多数与某个地狱社群联结起来, 因为他们还弃绝神性, 鄙视教会的真理. 事实上, 人越确认反对灵魂的永生, 也就越确认反对属于天堂和教会的事实. </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>452. 我曾與一些死了三天的人交談(對於他們,<a href="449.htm">449-450</a>所描述的過程已經完成), 其中有三位是我在人間所認識的。我告訴他們葬禮正在籌備, 好讓他們的肉體入土為安。聽到這話, 他們感到手足無措。其實, 他們依然活著, 將要埋葬的只是在人間曾服務於他們的物質之身。隨後, 他們驚訝地發現, 活在肉身之時, 他們也不相信死後生命的存在;更奇怪的是, 教會竟也沒幾個人相信它的存在。<br><br>有些人在世時不相信肉體的生命死去以後還會有靈繼續活下去。既發現自己依然活著, 就感到十分啟尬。固守成見的人與持相同想法之人開始聯合。他們多數與邪惡社群相聯, 因為他們拒絕上帝, 鄙視教會之理。事實上, 人若固執地反對靈魂的永生, 也必固執地反對天國和教會之理。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #452 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>452. I have talked with some people on the third day after their death, when the events described in <a href="449.htm">449</a>, <a href="450.htm">450</a> have been completed. I talked with three whom I had known in the world and told them that their funeral services were now being planned so that their bodies could be buried. When they heard me say it was so that they could be buried, they were struck with a kind of bewilderment. They said that they were alive, and that people were burying what had been useful to them in the world. Later on, they were utterly amazed at the fact that while they had been living in their bodies they had not believed in this kind of life after death, and particularly that this was the case for almost everyone in the church. <br><br>Some people during their earthly lives have not believed in any life of the soul after the life of the body. When they discover that they are alive, they are profoundly embarrassed. However, people who have convinced themselves of this join up with others of like mind and move away from people who had lived in faith. Most of them link up with some hellish community because such people reject the Divine and have no use for the truths of the church. In fact, to the extent that we convince ourselves in our opposition to the ideal of the eternal life of the soul, we also convince ourselves in opposition to the realities of heaven and the church. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #452 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p> 452. I have talked with some on the third day after their decease, when the things described above (<a href="449.htm">449-450</a>) took place. I also spoke with three whom I had known in the world, to whom I mentioned that arrangements were now being made for burying their bodies; I said, "for burying them"; on hearing which they were smitten with a kind of surprise, saying that they were alive, and that the thing that had served them in the world was what was being buried. Afterwards they wondered greatly that they had not believed in such a life after death while they lived in the body, and especially that scarcely any within the Church so believed. Those who, in the world, have not believed in any life of the soul after the life of the body are greatly ashamed when they find themselves to be alive. But those who have confirmed themselves in that disbelief seek association with their like, and are separated from those who have had faith. Such are for the most part attached to some infernal society, because they have also denied the Divine and have despised the truths of the Church. For so far as anyone confirms himself against the eternal life of his soul he confirms himself also against whatever pertains to heaven and the Church. </p><p align="center">------------</p>

<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #452 (original Latin)</h4><p>452. Locutus sum cum quibusdam tertio die post obitum eorum, et tunc illa, de quibus supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_452/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_449" target=_top>449</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_452/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_450" target=_top>450</a>) peracta sunt; cum tribus etiam, qui in mundo mihi noti fuerunt, quibus narravi, quod exsequiae nunc parentur ut corpus eorum sepeliatur: dixi, ut sepeliantur; quo audito, perculsi sunt quodam stupore, dicentes quod vivant, at intumulent id quod inserviverat illis in mundo. Postea mirati sunt valde, quod, cum vixerunt in corpore, non crediderint talem vitam post mortem, et imprimis quod intra ecclesiam paene omnes. illi qui non crediderunt in mundo aliquam vitam animae post vitam corporis, cum animadvertunt se vivere, valde pudefiunt: sed illi qui confirmaverunt se in eo, consociantur similibus, et separantur ab illis qui in fide fuerunt; utplurimum alligantur societati cuidam infernali, quia tales etiam negarunt Divinum, et contempserunt vera ecclesiae; quantum enim aliquis se confirmat contra vitam suae animae aeternam, tantum quoque se confirmat contra illa quae caeli et ecclesiae sunt. </p>
