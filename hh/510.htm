<h3 align="center" class="ired">《天堂与地狱》 第510节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>510、每个人都来到他自己的社群，这个社群就是他在世时灵魂所在的社群。因为就人的灵（魂）来说，每个人都与天堂或地狱的某个社群相连，恶人与地狱的社群相连，善人与天堂的社群相连，人死后就被带入这个社群（参看<a href="../hh/438.htm">438</a>节）。灵人逐渐被带入自己的社群，最终进入该社群。当恶灵处在自己的内层状态时，他逐渐转向自己的社群，最终在该状态结束之前，他直接面向它，当这个状态结束时，他把自己投入地狱，那里的人和他臭味相投。这种投入地狱的行为看上去就像是头朝下、脚朝上地坠落下去。它之所以看似这样，是因为这个灵人自身处在颠倒的秩序中，热爱地狱的事物，弃绝天堂的事物。在第二个状态中，有些恶灵会依次出入不同的地狱，但他们不像那些全然败坏的恶灵一头栽进地狱。<br><br>
此外，当他们还处在外层状态时，他们在世时灵魂所在的那个社群会被展示给他们看，由此他们可以知道，即使他们活在肉身的时候，他们就已经身处地狱了，尽管那时他们的状态与那些身处地狱里的人的状态不同，但却与那些身处灵人界里的人一样。稍后我将解释这种状态与地狱中的人相比是什么样子。<a href="#a515">｛注1｝</a><br><br>

<p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>510. 每个人都会去往他的灵在世时所在的那个社群; 因为就其灵而言, 每个人都与某个要么属地狱, 要么属天堂的社群相联, 恶人与地狱社群相联, 善人与天堂社群相联, 人死后就被带入这个社群(参看<a href="438.htm">438</a>节). 灵人逐渐被带入自己的社群, 最终进入该社群. 当恶灵处于其内层状态时, 他逐渐转向自己的社群, 最终在该状态结束之前, 直接面向它. 当这个状态结束时, 他便自动将自己扔进同类所在的地狱. 这种扔进地狱的行为看上去就像头朝下, 脚朝上栽下去. 它之所以看似这样, 是因为这个灵人本身处于颠倒的秩序, 热爱地狱的事物, 弃绝天堂的事物. 在第二个状态下, 有些恶灵会出入各种不同的地狱; 但这些恶灵不像那些已完全做好准备的人那样一头栽下去. 此外, 当处于外层状态时, 他们在世时其灵所在的那个社群本身会被指给他们看, 好叫他们由此知道, 甚至活在肉身之时, 他们就已身处地狱, 尽管其状态不同于那些身处地狱本身之人的, 但却与那些身处灵人界之人的一样. 后面我会解释与地狱之人的状态相比, 这种状态是什么样. </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>510. 人在世時, 他的靈與靈界哪個社群相聯, 死後便去到那個社群, 要麼天國般的社群, 要麼地獄般的社群, 其中惡者與地獄般的社群相聯, 善者與天國般的社群相聯。靈被帶到該社群, 是循序漸進的, 直到最後融入其中。當惡靈進入內在的狀態時, 他就一步一步地被轉向自己所屬的社群, 最終直接面對該社群, 這發生於內在狀態結束之前。該狀態結束以後, 惡靈就自行投入有同類之靈所在的地獄。這種投入的動作看起來像頭下腳上倒著跳入。這種現象的原因在於這樣的惡靈顛倒秩序, 熱愛邪惡的事物, 摒棄天國的事物。另外, 在第二種狀態中, 有的惡靈會出入不同的地獄, 只是他們不像完全做好準備的惡靈那樣頭下腳上倒著跳入的。<br><br>在惡靈處於外在的狀態時, 他們的靈活在肉身時與哪個社群相聯, 就已經顯示給他們。他們由此知道, 即使在肉身時, 他們已屬於地獄, 只是與地獄之靈並非同一狀態, 但與靈界惡靈處於同一狀態。關於這兩種狀態的對比, 後面我會加以解釋。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #510 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>510. Every individual comes to the community where her or his spirit was in the world. Each of us, as to spirit, is actually united to some community, either heavenly or hellish, evil people to hellish communities and good people to heavenly ones. (see <a href="438.htm">438</a> on the fact that we are brought to our own communities after death.) Spirits are brought there gradually, and ultimately get in. When evil spirits are in the state of their deeper concerns, they gradually turn toward their own communities and eventually face them directly, before this state is completed. When the state is completed, then the evil spirits themselves plunge into a hell where there are people of like mind. To the eye, this plunge looks like someone falling backward headfirst. The reason it looks like this is that such people are in an inverted order. They have loved hellish things and spurned heavenly ones. During this second state, some evil people go in and out of various hells; but they do not seem then to go headlong the way people do when they have been completely undone. <br><br>The actual community where their spirits were in the world is shown to them, too, while they are in the state of their outer concerns, so that they know from this that they were in hell during their physical life; but still they are not in the same state as the people who are in hell itself. Rather, they are in a state like that of people in the world of spirits. I will explain later what this state is like compared to that of people in hell. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #510 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p> 510. Everyone comes to his own society in which his spirit was in the world; for every man, as regards his spirit, is conjoined to some society, either infernal or heavenly, the evil man to an infernal society and the good man to a heavenly society, and to that society he is brought after death (see <a href="438.htm">438</a>). The spirit is led to his society gradually, and at length enters it. When an evil spirit is in the state of his interiors he is turned by degrees towards his own society, and at length, before that state is ended, directly to it; and when that state is ended he himself casts himself into the hell where those are who are like himself. This act of casting down appears to the sight like one falling headlong with the head downwards and the feet upwards. The cause of this appearance is that the spirit himself is in an inverted order, having loved infernal things and rejected heavenly things. In this second state some evil spirits enter the hells and come out again by turns; but these do not appear to fall headlong as those do who are fully vastated. Moreover, the society itself in which they were as regards their spirit while in the world is shown to them when they are in the state of their exteriors, that they may thus learn that even while in the life of the body they were in hell, although not in the same state as those who are in hell itself; but in the same state as those who are in the world of spirits. Of this state, as compared with those who are in hell, more will be said in following sections. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #510 (Ager, 1900)</h4><p>510. Everyone goes to his own society in which his spirit had been in the world; for every man, as regards his spirit, is conjoined to some society, either infernal or heavenly, the evil man to an infernal society and the good man to a heavenly society, and to that society he is brought after death (see <a href="438.htm">438</a>). The spirit is led to his society gradually, and at length enters it.

<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #510 (original Latin)</h4><p>510. Quisque ad societatem suam venit in qua fuit ejus spiritus in mundo; unusquisque enim homo quoad spiritum suum conjunctus est alicui societati vel infernali vel caelesti, malus societati infernali, bonus societati caelesti; quod quisque ad suam societatem redeat post mortem videatur, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_510/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_438" target=_top>438</a>; ad illam perducitur spiritus successive, et tandem intrat illam. Malus spiritus, cum in statu <sup>1</sup>interiorum suorum est, vertitur per gradus ad suam societatem, et tandem directe ad illam, antequam finitus est hic status et cum status finitus est, tunc ipse spiritus malus se conjicit in infernum, ubi sui similes sunt. Ipsa conjectio apparet ad visum sicut qui supinatus cadit capite deorsum et pedibus sursum: causa quod ita appareat, est quia in inverso ordine est, amaverat enim infernalia ac rejecerat caelestia. Quidam mali in secundo hoc statu per vices intrant inferna, et quoque exeunt, sed hi non apparent tunc supinati cadere, sicut cum plene vastati sunt. Ipsa societas, in qua fuerunt quoad spiritum suum in mundo, ostenditur quoque illis cum in statu exteriorum suorum sunt, ut sciant inde quod in inferno fuerint etiam in vita corporis, sed tamen non in simili statu cum illis qui in ipso inferno, sed in simili cum statu illorum qui in mundo spirituum sunt de quorum statu respective ad illorum qui in inferno sunt, in sequentibus dicetur.<br><br> <br><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br><div class="footnote-section"><br>1.&nbsp;statu pro "statum" </p>
