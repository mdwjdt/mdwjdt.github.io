<h3 align="center" class="ired">《天堂与地狱》 第554节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>554、通过观察地狱灵人的畸形怪状（如前文所述，这些都是蔑视他人、威胁那些不尊荣、不尊重他们的人的表现形式，以及仇恨、报复那些不喜欢他们的人的表现形式），很明显，总的来说，它们都是自我之爱和世界之爱的形式；这些具体形式的邪恶都源于这两种爱。此外，我从天堂得知，并且被大量的经历证实，这两种爱，即自我之爱和世界之爱，统治地狱并造就地狱，正如爱主和爱邻舍统治天堂也造就天堂；两种地狱之爱和两种天堂之爱也是截然对立的。</p>
<p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>554. 经过查看地狱灵的这些扭曲变形的形式(如我所说的, 这些形式都是蔑视他人, 威胁那些不崇敬, 尊重他们之人的形式, 以及仇恨, 报复那些不支持他们之人的形式), 我清楚明白, 它们总体上都是自我之爱和尘世之爱的形式; 产生这些特定形式的邪恶都可追溯到这两种爱. 此外, 我从天堂被告知, 这两种爱, 即自我之爱和尘世之爱, 的确在地狱掌权, 并实际构成地狱; 而对主之爱和对邻之爱则在天堂掌权, 并实际构成天堂; 这一点也通过大量经历向我证实了. 我还获知, 系地狱之爱的这两种爱和系天堂之爱的这两种爱截然对立. </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>554. 見識了地獄之靈的醜陋形相(如前所述, 盡是蔑視, 恐嚇, 仇恨, 報復的形相), 我明白:籠統而言, 它們都是我欲和物欲的形相。使他們顯出此等形相的罪惡, 全都可追溯到那兩種欲望。再者, 我從天國得知, 且通過大量經歷證實, 我欲(啟自己)和物欲(啟世界)的確在地獄占主導地位。事實上, 地獄正是由兩者所構成。愛主和愛鄰則在天國占主導地位, 事實上, 天國正是由此兩者所構成。我還得知, 地獄的兩種欲望與天國的兩種愛全然對立。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #554 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>554. Having examined the misshapen forms of spirits in the hells, forms that as noted are all forms of contempt for others, of threats against people who do not respect and revere them, and of hatred and vengeance against people who do not support them, it has become clear to me that in general they are all forms of love for oneself and the world and that the evils that give rise to individual forms can all be traced back to these two loves. I have also been told from heaven, and it has been witnessed to me by an abundance of experience, that these two loves, love for oneself and love of the world, do rule in the hells and actually constitute the hells, and that love for the Lord and love for one's neighbor rule in the heavens and actually constitute the heavens. I have also learned that the two loves that are hell's loves and the two loves that are heaven's loves are absolute opposites. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #554 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p> 554. From an inspection of these monstrous forms of spirits in the hells (which, as already mentioned, are all forms of contempt of others and of menaces against those who do not pay them honour and respect, also forms of hatred and revenge against those who do not favour them), it became evident that, in general, they were all forms of the love of self and the love of the world; and that the evils of which these are the specific forms derive their origin from these two loves. Moreover, I have been told from heaven, and it has been proved to me by much experience, that these two loves, namely, the love of self and the love of the world, rule in the hells and also make the hells; as love to the Lord and love towards the neighbour rule in the heavens and also make the heavens; also that the two loves that are the loves of hell and the two loves that are the loves of heaven are diametrically opposite to each other. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #554 (Ager, 1900)</h4><p>554. From an inspection of these monstrous forms of spirits in the hells (which, as I have said, are all forms of contempt of others and of menaces against those who do not pay them honor and respect, also forms of hatred and revenge against those who do not favor them), it became evident that in general they were all forms of the love of self and the love of the world; and that the evils of which these are the specific forms have their origin in these two loves. Moreover, I have been told from heaven, and it has been proved to me by much experience, that these two loves, the love of self and the love of the world, rule in the hells and constitute the hells as love to the Lord and love towards the neighbor rule in the heavens and constitute the heavens; also that the two loves that are the loves of hell and the two loves that are the loves of heaven are diametrically opposite to each other. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #554 (original Latin)</h4><p>554. Ex inspectis illis formis monstrosis spirituum in infernis, (quae, ut dictum est, omnes sunt formae contemptus aliorum, ac minarum contra illos qui se non honorant et venerantur; tum formae odiorum et vindictarum contra illos qui sibi non favent,) patuit, quod omnes in genere essent formae amoris sui et amoris mundi; et quod mala, quorum speciales formae sunt, ex illis binis amoribus suas origines ducant. Dictum quoque mihi est e caelo, et quoque per multam experientiam testatum factum est, quod bini illi amores, nempe amor sui et amor mundi, regnent in infernis, et quoque faciant inferna; ac quod amor in Dominum et amor erga proximum regnent in caelis, et quoque faciant caelos tum quod illi bini amores, qui sunt amores inferni, ac illi bini amores, qui sunt amores caeli, sint sibi e diametro oppositi. </p>
