<h4 align="center"></h4><p>595、要知道，地狱不断地猛烈攻击天堂并试图摧毁它，而主则阻止那里的人进入出于他们自我的邪恶，并将他们保守在来自祂自己的良善中，通过这种方式不断地保护天堂。我经常蒙允许感知从地狱涌出的气场，它完全是一种努力摧毁主的神性、从而摧毁天堂的气场。有时我还感知到某些地狱沸腾的力量，是为了爆发和摧毁的努力。但另一方面，天堂从不攻击地狱，因为从主发出的神性气场不断努力地拯救所有人。由于地狱里的人都处在邪恶中、与主的神性对抗，不能得救，所以，地狱里的暴行尽可能地被遏制，残酷的行为尽可能地被约束，防止他们之间爆发出无可估量的冲突。这也是通过无数的方法行使神性的大能来实现的。</p>

<p>595. 要知道, 地狱不断攻击天堂, 试图摧毁它, 而主则通过使天堂里的人远离他们的自我所产生的邪恶, 将他们保守在来自祂自己的良善中而不断保护天堂. 我经常蒙允许感受从地狱流出的气场, 该气场完全是一种努力摧毁主的神性, 从而摧毁天堂的气场. 有时我还觉察到某些地狱沸腾的力量, 这些力量构成一种挣脱并摧毁的努力. 而另一方面, 天堂却从不攻击地狱, 因为从主发出的神性气场不断努力拯救所有人. 但由于地狱里的人都陷入邪恶, 与主的神性对抗, 因而无法得救, 所以地狱里的攻击尽可能被遏制, 残暴行为被约束, 以防止它们超出界限向彼此爆发出来. 这也是通过神性大能所采取的无数方法实现的. </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>595. 我們當知, 地獄無時無刻不在攻擊天國, 意欲毀滅之。主則無時無刻不在保守天國, 引導我們離棄因"自我"所生之惡, 將我們保守於善之中。我時常被允許感受從地獄所發出的氣場, 它完全是一股邪惡之力, 意欲摧毀主的神性, 進而摧毀天國。有時我也得以感受某些地獄的騷動, 它們意欲擺脫束縛, 施行毀滅。另一方面, 天國卻從不攻擊地獄, 因為從主發出的神性氣場是拯救所有人的不懈努力。但是, 由於地獄之人皆陷於惡中, 與主的神性對抗, 無從得救, 主就只有盡可能地控制地獄內部的相互攻擊, 約束他們的殘暴之性, 免得它超出一定的界限。這同樣是神性權能通過無數的途徑來實現的。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #595 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>595. It needs to be realized that the hells are constantly attacking heaven and trying to destroy it and that the Lord is constantly protecting the heavens by restraining the people there from the evils that arise from their self-concern and by keeping them involved in the good that comes from him. I have often been granted a sense of the aura that radiates from the hells - an aura of nothing but efforts to destroy the divine nature of the Lord and therefore heaven as well. At times I have also perceived forces boiling up from certain hells, made up of efforts to break free and wreak destruction. On the other hand, the heavens never attack the hells, since the divine aura that emanates from the Lord is a constant effort to save everyone. Since the people in the hells cannot be saved (all the people there being engrossed in evil and opposed to the Lord's divine nature), the attacks within the hells are kept as subdued as possible, and mutual viciousness is held within bounds. This too is accomplished by countless exercises of divine power. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #595 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p> 595. It should be known that the hells are continually assaulting heaven and endeavouring to destroy it, and that the Lord continually protects the heavens by withholding those who are there from the evils derived from their proprium, and by holding them in the good that is from Himself. I have often been permitted to perceive the sphere that flows forth from the hells, which was wholly a sphere of effort to destroy the Divine of the Lord, and thus heaven. The ebullitions of some hells have also at times been perceived, which were efforts to break forth and to destroy. But, on the other hand, the heavens never assault the hells, for the Divine sphere that goes forth from the Lord is a perpetual effort to save all; and as those who are in the hells cannot be saved (since all who are there are in evil and are antagonistic to the Divine of the Lord), so as far as possible outrages in the hells are subdued and cruelties are restrained to prevent their breaking out beyond measure one against another. This also is effected by innumerable ways in which the Divine power is exercised. </p><p align="center">------------</p>

<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #595 (original Latin)</h4><p>595. Sciendum est quod inferna continue aggrediantur caelum, et conentur destruere illud; et quod Dominus continue tutetur caelos, detinendo illos, qui ibi sunt, a malis quae sunt ex proprio illorum, ac tenendo in bono quod ab Ipso. Datum est saepius percipere sphaeram effluentem ex infernis, quae tota fuit sphaera conatuum destruendi Divinum Domini, et sic caelum: perceptae etiam aliquoties sunt ebullitiones aliquorum infernorum, quae fuerunt conatus emergendi et destruendi. Vicissim autem caeli nusquam aggrediuntur inferna nam sphaera Divina procedens a Domino, est perptuus conatus salvandi omnes et quia non salvari possunt qui in infernis, quoniam omnes, qui ibi, sunt in malo et contra Divinum Domini, ideo quantum possibile est, in infernis domantur insultus, et arcentur saevitiae ne erumpant contra se invicem ibi ultra modum; quod etiam fit per innumera potentiae Divinae media. </p>
