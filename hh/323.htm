<h3 align="center" class="ired">《天堂与地狱》 第323节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>323、我还被允许与生活在古代的其他人交谈，他们在当时属于较有智慧的人。一开始，他们远远地出现在我面前，然后就能感知我思想的内层，从而充分了解许多事情。从一个想法，他们能够洞察整个一系列的思想，并用智慧的快乐事物和迷人的表象充满它。我由此感知他们属于更有智慧的人，并且被告知，他们是一些古代的人。当他们走近时，我从圣经里读了些经文给他们听，他们欣喜若狂，我能察觉到他们喜悦和满足的本质，主要是由此产生的，即他们从圣经中所听到的一切事物和每件事物，都代表和表示属天和属灵的事物。他们说，在他们生活在世上的时代，他们的思想、言谈和书写的模式都是这种性质，这是他们对智慧的追求。</p>
<p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>323. 我还被允许与生活在早期时代, 当时属更有智慧者的其他人交谈. 一开始, 他们出现在我前方, 有一定距离; 他们从那里就能觉察我思维的内层. 这意味着他们能非常全面地观察我, 仅从一个思维观念就能洞察整整一系列的思维, 并以智慧的快乐元素和迷人的形象充满它. 我由此判断他们属于更有智慧的人, 并被告知, 他们是一些早期时代的人. 当他们走近时, 我给他们读圣言, 他们欣喜若狂. 我能察觉他们快乐和满足的本质; 这些快乐和满足主要源于以下事实: 他们从圣言所听到的每一个细节都是属天和属灵事物的形像和标志. 他们说, 在他们活在世上的那个时代, 人们思维, 言谈和写作的模式都具有这种性质, 这是他们对智慧的追求. </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>323. 我還被允許與上古時代最有智慧的人交談。一開始, 他們顯現在我前方, 有一定距離, 在那兒, 他們能洞察我內在的思想。從我一個小小的念頭, 他們能看出一整串的思想活動, 並賦之以智慧和妙相之樂。由此可知, 他們乃是智者中的智者。我被告知, 他們來自上古時代。此時, 他們走近我, 我給他們讀聖言, 他們陶醉其中。我能感覺到他們的喜樂, 這喜樂尤其源於他們從聖言聽到的每一個細節都象徵屬天屬靈之事物的事實。他們說在其生活於世的年代, 人們思想, 言說乃至寫作的模式都是如此, 且是其智慧所最關注的。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #323 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>323. I have also been allowed to talk with some others who lived in early days and were among the wiser ones of their times. They first appeared in front of me at some distance, and from there they could observe the deeper levels of my thinking. This meant they could observe me very completely, learning a whole series of thoughts from just one of my mental concepts and filling it with delightful elements of wisdom and charming images. I could tell from this that they were among the wiser ones; and I was told that they were from early times. At this point they came nearer, and when I read them something from the Word, they were totally enchanted. I could sense their very delight and pleasure, which stemmed especially from the fact that every least detail of what they were hearing from the Word was an image and indicator of heavenly and spiritual things. They said that in their own day, when they were living in our world, their mode of thinking and speaking and even writing was like this, and that this was the focus of their wisdom. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #323 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p> 323. It has also been granted me to talk with others who lived in ancient times, and who were then among the more wise. At first they appeared in front at a distance, and were able then to perceive the interiors of my thoughts, thus many things fully. From one idea of thought they were able to discern the entire series and fill it with delightful things of wisdom combined with delightful representations. From this they were perceived to be among the more wise, and I was told that they were some of the ancient people. So when they came nearer I read to them something from the Word, and they were delighted beyond measure. I perceived the essence of their delight and gratification, which arose chiefly from this, that all things and each thing they heard from the Word were representative and significative of heavenly and spiritual things. They said that in their time, when they lived in the world, their mode of thinking and speaking and also of writing was of this nature, and that this was their study of wisdom. </p><p align="center">------------</p>

<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #323 (original Latin)</h4><p>323. Loqui etiam datum est cum aliis, qui antiquis temporibus vixerant, et qui tunc inter sapientiores fuerunt. Visi primum antrorsum ad distantiam, ac ibi potuerunt appercipere interiora cogitationum mearum, ita multa plene ex una idea cogitationis potuerunt scire integram seriem, et illam delectabilibus sapientiae cum repraesentationibus amoenis implere. Inde perceptum est, quod inter sapientiores essent, et dictum est, quod essent ab antiquis. Ac ita propius accesserunt: cumque tunc praelegerem illis aliquid ex Verbo, summopere delectati sunt; ipsam delectationem et jucunditatem eorum percipiebam, quae maxime inde erat, quod omnia et singula quae audiebant ex Verbo, caelestium ac spiritualium repraesentativa et significativa essent. Dicebant, quod suo tempore, cum in mundo vixerunt, modus eorum cogitandi et loquendi, tum quoque scribendi, talis fuerit, et quod hoc sapientiae eorum studium. </p>
