<h3 align="center" class="ired">《天堂与地狱》 第310节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>310、我有时和天使谈论圣经，说它因为风格简单<a href="#a382">｛注1｝</a>而被一些人轻视。这些人对圣经的内义一无所知，因而不相信其中隐藏着这么多的智慧。天使说，虽然圣经的风格在字义上看起来很简单，但是没有什么能与它的卓越相比，因为神性的智慧不仅隐藏在整体意义中，而且也隐藏在每个字中，这智慧在天堂发光。天使很想宣称，这智慧是天堂之光，因为它是神性真理，而在天堂发光的，正是神性真理（参看<a href="../hh/132.htm">132</a>节）。他们还说，若没有这圣经，地球人中间就没有天堂之光，也就没有天堂与人类的任何结合。因为只有当天堂之光与人同在时，才会有结合，而只有通过圣经向世人揭示神性真理时，那光才会与人同在。世人不知道这种通过圣经的属灵意义与属世意义相对应的方式实现的结合，因为世人对天使的属灵思想和言语、以及它们如何不同于世人的属世思想和言语一无所知，人若不知道这一点，绝无可能知道什么是内义，因而不可能知道这内义使得这种结合成为可能。他们又说，如果世人知道有这内义，并且在阅读圣经时照着它的一些知识来思考，他就会进入内在智慧，与天堂结合得更紧密，因为他以这种方式进入了类似天使意念的意念中。<br><br>
<a name="a382">｛注1｝</a>：【英204】在18世纪的欧洲，从音乐到绘画再到叙事，复杂的细节成为时尚，时髦的风格实际上是华丽的代名词。</p>

<p>310. 我有时与天使谈论圣言, 并告诉他们说, 圣言因其平淡无奇的风格而被某些人轻视. 他们对圣言的内义一无所知, 故而不相信其中隐藏着这种智慧. 天使说, 就字义而言, 圣言的风格纵然显得平淡无奇, 但在品质上却是无与伦比的, 因为神性智慧不仅隐藏在作为一个整体的意义中, 还隐藏在每句话中; 这智慧在天堂闪耀. 天使很想宣称, 这智慧是天堂之光, 因为它是神性真理; 而在天堂闪耀的, 正是神性真理(参看<a href="132.htm">132</a>节). 他们补充说, 若没有这种圣言, 地球人中间就不会有天堂之光, 也就不会有天堂与他们的任何联结; 因为天堂之光在世人当中的量决定了联结, 并因此决定了世人通过圣言获得神性真理的启示的程度. 人们之所以不知道藉由圣言属灵之义与属世之义的对应的这种联结存在, 是因为地球人对天使的属灵思维和言语, 以及它如何不同于世人的属世思维和言语一无所知; 人若不知道这一点, 绝无可能知道何为内义, 因而不可能知道这内义使得这种联结成为可能. 他们还说, 如果这种意义为人所知, 并且人在阅读圣言时照着它的某种知识来思考, 他就会进入内在智慧, 与天堂联结得更紧密, 因为他以这种方式进入类似天使观念的观念. </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>310. 關於聖言, 我曾偶爾與天人談論。我說, 聖言因其平淡無奇的風格而被某些人輕視。此等人對聖言的靈義一無所知, 故而不信其中隱藏著高深的智慧。天人告訴我, 聖言的風格, 就字義而言, 縱然顯得平淡無奇, 其本質卻是不可比的, 因為神性的智慧藏於其中, 不僅在總體的意義上, 也在每一個字中;這智慧在天國大放光明。天人樂於宣告, 聖言是天國之光, 因為它是神性的真理;在天國, 神性真理光芒四射(參<a href="132.htm">132</a>節)。天人還說, 若無此類聖言, 地球上的人就不能獲得天國之光, 也就不能與天國相通。因為天國之光的多寡決定了人與天國結合的程度, 也就決定了人從聖言獲得真知的程度。<br><br>人不知有此結合存在(通過聖言之屬靈義與屬世義的對應), 在於地球上的人對天人屬靈的思維和語言一無所知, 不知其不同於人类屬世的思維和語言。此若不知, 就無從明瞭何為靈義, 也就不知結合能因它而存在。<br><br>天人還說, 人若知道靈義的存在, 讀經時以相關的知識來作思考, 就能進入更深的智慧, 與天國結合得更為緊密。因為通過這種方式, 人能進入天人那樣的觀念。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #310 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>310. I have talked with angels about the Word on occasion, and have told them that it is looked down on by some people because of its pedestrian style. They know absolutely nothing about its deeper meaning and therefore do not believe that this kind of wisdom lies hidden within. The angels have told me that even though the style of the Word may appear pedestrian in its literal meaning, it is qualitatively incomparable because divine wisdom lies hidden not just in the overall meaning but in every word, and that this wisdom shines out in heaven. They have wanted to declare that because it is divine truth, it is heaven's light, since divine truth in heaven is radiant (see above, <a href="132.htm">132</a>). They have added that without this kind of Word there would be no light of heaven among the people of our earth and consequently no union with heaven for them; for the amount of heaven's light there is among us determines the union and therefore the extent to which we have any revelation of divine truth through the Word. The reason people do not know this union exists (through the spiritual meaning of the Word corresponding to its natural meaning) is that the people of our earth do not know anything about angels' spiritual thinking and conversation. They do not know that this is different from our natural thinking and conversation; and anyone who does not know this cannot possibly know what the inner meaning is and therefore cannot know that it can make this kind of union possible. <br><br>They have also said that if we knew that this kind of meaning existed and when we read the Word did our thinking with any knowledge of it, we would come into a deeper wisdom and be more closely united to heaven, because in this way we would have access to concepts like those of angels. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #310 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p> 310. I have at times talked with angels about the Word, saying that it is despised by some on account of its simple style; and that nothing whatever is known about its internal sense, and for this reason it is not believed that so much wisdom lies hidden within it. The angels said that although the style of the Word seems simple in the sense of the letter, it is such that nothing can ever be compared with it in excellence, since Divine Wisdom lies concealed not only in the meaning as a whole but also in each word; and that in heaven this wisdom shines forth. They wished to declare that this wisdom is the light of heaven, because it is Divine Truth, for that which shines in heaven is the Divine Truth (see <a href="132.htm">132</a>). Again, they said that without such a Word there would be no light of heaven with the men of our earth, nor would there be any conjunction of heaven with them; for there is conjunction only so far as the light of heaven is present with man, and that light is present only so far as Divine Truth is revealed to man by means of the Word. This conjunction by means of the correspondence of the spiritual sense of the Word with its natural sense is unknown to man, because the man of this earth knows nothing about the spiritual thought and speech of angels, and how it differs from the natural thought and speech of men; and unless this is known it cannot in the least be known what the internal sense is, and that such conjunction is therefore possible by means of that sense. They said, furthermore, that if man knew that there is such a sense, and in reading the Word were to think in accordance with some knowledge of it, he would come into interior wisdom, and would be still more conjoined with heaven, since by this means he would enter into ideas like the ideas of the angels. </p><p align="center">------------</p>

<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #310 (original Latin)</h4><p>310. Cum angelis de Verbo aliquoties locutus sum, et dixi, quod id a quibusdam contemnatur propter stilum ejus simplicem; et quod prorsus non sciatur aliquid de sensu ejus interno, et inde non credatur quod tanta sapientia inibi recondita lateat. Angeli dixerunt, quod stilus Verbi, tametsi in sensu litterae apparet simplex, usque talis sit ut nusquam aliquid ei comparari queat quoad excellentiam, quoniam Divina sapientia non solum in omni sensu ibi, sed etiam in singula voce, latet; et quod illa sapientia eluceat in caelo voluerunt dicere quod sit lux caeli, quia est Divinum Verum; nam Divinum Verum in caelo lucet (videatur supra, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_310/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_132" target=_top>132</a>). Dixerunt etiam, quod absque tali Verbo nulla foret lux caeli apud homines nostrae telluris, ita nec conjunctio caeli cum illis, nam quantum lux caeli adest apud hominem, tantum est conjunctio, et quoque tantum est ei revelatio Divini Veri per Verbum: quod homo non sciat quod conjunctio illa sit per sensum spiritualem Verbi correspondentem sensui ejus naturali, est causa, quia homo hujus telluris non scit aliquid de spirituali angelorum cogitatione et loquela, et quod sit diversa a naturali hominum cogitatione et loquela; et nisi id sciat quod prorsus non scire possit quid sensus internus, et inde quod per illum talis conjunctio dari possit. Dixerunt etiam, si homo sciret quod talis sensus sit, et ex aliqua ejus scientia cogitaret cum legit Verbum, quod veniret in sapientiam interiorem, et plus adhuc conjungeretur caelo, quoniam per id in ideas similes angelicis intraret. </p>
