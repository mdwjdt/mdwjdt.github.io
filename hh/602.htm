<h3 align="center" class="ired">《天堂与地狱》 第602节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>602、最后，要特别提到人对于死后生命的天生的信念，这种信念源于天堂流进人的流注。有一些简单的普通人，在世时曾活在信仰的良善中，他们被带回到类似在世时所在的状态（主若恩准，这事可发生在任何人身上），然后显明他们对人死后状态的看法。他们说，在世时，一些聪明人曾问他们，他们认为在尘世的生命结束后灵魂会是怎样的。他们回答说，他们不知道灵魂是什么；随后，他们又被问到他们对自己死后的状态有什么看法，他们回答说，他们相信自己会作为灵活着；此外，他们又被问到他们对灵有什么样的信仰，他们说，灵就是人；他们又被问到，他们是怎么知道的。他们说，他们之所以知道，因为事实就是如此。那些聪明的人惊讶地发现，简单的人竟有这样的信仰，而他们自己却没有。<br><br>
由此显明，凡与天堂结合的人，对死后的生命都有天生的信念。这种信念的唯一源头是来自天堂的流注，也就是出于主、经由天堂、通过与人相连的灵人界的灵人的流注。那些没有确认有关人的灵魂的各种谬误、思想自由没有被扼杀的人，天生固有这信念。有关灵魂的各种谬论包括：灵魂要么是纯粹的思想，要么是在身体中寻求位置的某种生命力。然而，灵魂无非是人的生命，而灵就是人自己。他在世时所携带的身体纯粹是个媒介，透过它，灵，也就是此人自己，能在尘世中恰当地行动。<a href="#a555">｛注1｝</a><br><br>
<a name="a555">｛注1｝</a>：【中】本节瑞典伯格提及“灵魂（soul）”、“灵（spirit）”，以表明它们有差异。笔者理解，通常，人们将肉体之外的部分称为“灵魂”，当人离开尘世、进入灵界后，生活在灵界的是人的灵（spirit），非物质的、灵性的生命，又称为“灵人”。“灵魂”中尚有一部分是与尘世物质相关的，不在人的灵里，如外在的或属世的记忆中那些物质的事物，会处在休眠状态（参见第<a href="../hh/464.htm">464</a>节）。</p>
<p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>602. 最后有必要说说人对于其死后生命的直觉, 这种直觉源于天堂进入人的流注. 有些简单的普通人在世时活在信之良善中, 他们被带回在世时所处的那种状态(主若恩准, 这种事可发生在任何人身上), 然后显明他们对于人死后的状态曾持有什么样的观点. 他们说, 在世时, 一些聪明人曾问他们对于其尘世生命结束后的灵魂是怎么想的; 他们回答说, 他们不知道灵魂是什么. 然后, 提问者问他们对于其死后的状态所信的是什么; 他们说, 他们相信自己会作为灵活着. 接下来他们又被问及他们对于灵持哪种信仰; 他们说, 灵是人. 提问者不断追问他们是怎么知道这一点的; 他们说, 他们之所以知道, 是因为这是事实. 这些聪明人惊讶于简单人竟具有他们自己所没有的这种信仰.<br><br>我由此看出, 凡与天堂相联者, 都具有一种对其死后生命的直觉. 这种直觉的唯一源头就是出于天堂的流注, 也就是从主经由天堂藉着与人相联的灵人界的灵人而来的流注. 那些以前没有因通过有关人之灵魂的各种论据所吸收并确认的观点而扼杀自己的思想自由之人就拥有这种直觉, 这些论据包括: 灵魂要么是纯粹的思维, 要么是在身体中寻求其位置的某种生命力; 然而, 灵魂无非是人的生命, 而灵就是此人自己; 他在世时所携带的尘世肉体纯粹是世俗事物, 仅仅是灵, 也就是此人自己为了能适合在自然界行动所使用的一个工具. </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>602. 最後說說人因天國之靈流而對死後生命所產生的直覺。有一些人, 在世之時曾照信仰過善良的生活, 當時他們只是普通的百姓, 他們被帶回在世時的狀態(主若許, 此事可發生在任何人身上), 好將他們當時對死後生命的看法顯明出來。他們說, 在世之時, 一些有學問的人曾詢問他們對靈的看法, 他們說不知何為靈。於是問他們對死後生命的看法, 他們說人死後將以靈的形態存在, 便又問他們對靈的看法, 他們說靈就是人, 又問他們何以知道靈就是人, 他們說本來就是。這些有學問的人, 不禁為普通百姓竟擁有連他們都不曾有的認識而感到驚訝。<br><br>我由此看出, 凡與天國相通者, 都有著對死後生命的直覺。該直覺的唯一源頭是天國之流, 從主經由天國透過靈界的靈傳遞給我們。凡不曾接受錯誤成見(例如認為靈只是一種純粹的想法或是一股處於身體某個部位的生氣), 思想上的自由沒有被壓抑的人, 都擁有這種直覺。事實上, 靈就是人的生命, 就是人本身, 肉體只是他在人間所披戴的軀殼, 是靈用來在人間活動的工具。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #602 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>602. One last note, about our instinct concerning life after death that results from heaven's inflow into us. There were some common people who had lived in the virtues of their faith in the world. They were brought back into a state like the one they had in the world (which can happen to anyone when the Lord allows it), and then shown what kind of notion they had had about our state after death. They said that in the world, some intelligent people had asked them what they thought about their soul after their life in the world, and they said they did not know what a soul was. Then the questioners asked them what they believed about their state after death, and they said they believed they would live as spirits. Next they were asked what kind of belief they had about spirits, and they said that spirits were people. Their questioners kept asking how they knew this, and they kept saying that they knew it because it was true. The intelligent people were amazed that simple people had this kind of faith when they themselves did not. <br><br>I could see from this that everyone who is united to heaven has an instinctive notion about life after death. The sole source of this instinctive notion is the inflow from heaven, that is, through heaven from the Lord, by means of spirits who are assigned to us from the world of spirits. This instinctive notion is possessed by people who have not stifled their freedom of thought by assumptions about the human soul that they have seized on and confirmed by various means, assumptions that the soul is either pure thought or some animate principle whose seat they seek in the body. However, the soul is nothing more nor less than our life, while the spirit is the actual person, and the body is an earthly thing we carry around in the world. It is only an agent through which our spirit, the actual person, acts in a way that is adapted to the natural world. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #602 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p>602. Finally, something should be noted respecting man's inherent conviction in regard to his life after death which is derived from the influx of heaven into man. There were some of the simple, common people who had lived in the world in the good of faith who were brought back into a state like that in which they had been in the world, which can be done with anyone when the Lord grants it; and it was then shown what opinion they had held about the state of man after death. They said that some intelligent persons had asked them in the world what they thought about their soul after the life on earth; and they replied that they did not know what the soul is. They were then asked what they believed about their state after death; and they said that they believed that they would live as spirits. Again they were asked what belief they had respecting a spirit; and they said that he is a man. They were asked how they knew this; and they said that they knew it because it is so. Those intelligent men were surprised that the simple had such a faith, which they themselves did not have. From this it was evident that with every man who is in conjunction with heaven there is an inherent conviction respecting his life after death. This conviction is from no other source than an influx out of heaven, that is, through heaven from the Lord by means of spirits from the world of spirits who are adjoined to man. It inheres with those who have not extinguished their freedom of thinking by principles adopted and confirmed by various arguments respecting the soul of man, which is held to be either pure thought, or some vital principle the seat of which is sought for in the body; and yet the soul is nothing but the life of man, while the spirit is the man himself; and the earthly body which he carries about with him in the world is merely an agent whereby the spirit, which is the man himself is enabled to act fitly in the natural world. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #602 (Ager, 1900)</h4><p>602. Finally something must be said respecting man's intuition in regard to his life after death which is derived from the influx of heaven into man. There were some of the simple common people who had lived in the world in the good of faith who were brought back into a state like that in which they had been in the world, which can be done with any one when the Lord grants it; and it was then shown what opinion they had held about the state of man after death. They said that some intelligent persons had asked them in the world what they thought about their soul after the life on earth; and they replied that they did not know what the soul is. They were then asked what they believed about their state after death; and they said that they believed that they would live as spirits. Again they were asked what belief they had respecting a spirit; and they said that he is a man. They were asked how they knew this; and they said that they knew it because it is so. Those intelligent men were surprised that the simple had such a faith, which they themselves did not have. This is a proof that in every man who is in conjunction with heaven there is an intuition respecting his life after death. This intuition is from no other source than an influx out of heaven, that is, through heaven from the Lord by means of spirits from the world of spirits who are joined with man. This intuition those have who have not extinguished their freedom of thinking by notions previously adopted and confirmed by various arguments respecting the soul of man, which is held to be either pure thought, or some vital principle the seat of which is sought for in the body; and yet the soul is nothing but the life of man, while the spirit is the man himself; and the earthly body which he carries about with him in the world is merely an agent whereby the spirit, which is the man himself, is enabled to act fitly in the natural world. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #602 (original Latin)</h4><p>602. Ultimo memorandum est de insito, quod est ex influxu caeli apud hominem, de vita ejus post mortem. Fuerunt quidam ex simplici plebe, qui in bono fidei in mundo vixerunt illi in statum similem, in quo fuerunt in mundo, redacti sunt hoc fieri cum unoquovis potest cum Dominus concedit; et tunc ostensum est qualem ideam de statu hominis post mortem habuerunt. Dixerunt quod aliqui intelligentes in mundo interrogaverint illos quid cogitant de anima sua post vitam in mundo; dixerunt quod non sciant quid anima. Interrogaverunt porro quid credunt de statu suo post mortem; dixerunt quod credant se victuros spiritus. Tunc interrogaverunt qualem fidem habent de spiritu dixerunt quod sit homo. Interrogabant unde hoc sciant dicebant quod id sciant quia ita est. Intelligentes illi mirati sunt, quod talis fides esset simplicibus, et quod non sibi. Inde patuit, quod apud unumquemvis hominem, qui in conjunctione est cum caelo, sit insitum de vita sua post mortem. Hoc insitum non aliunde est quam ex influxu e caelo, hoc est, per caelum a Domino, mediis spiritibus, qui e mundo spirituum homini adjuncti sunt; et [memorandum est] quod sit illis, apud quos liberum cogitandi non exstinctum est per principia capta et variis confirmata de anima hominis, quam vel dicunt esse puram cogitationem, vel aliquod principium animatum, cujus sedem in corpore inquirunt; cum tamen anima non est nisi quam vita hominis, at spiritus est ipse homo, ac corpus terrestre quod circumfert in mundo est modo administrum, per quod spiritus, qui est ipse homo, convenienter agit in mundo naturali. </p>
