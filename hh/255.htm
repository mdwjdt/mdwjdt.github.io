<h3 align="center" class="ired">《天堂与地狱》 第255节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>255、为了能理解天使和灵人与人结合的性质，我蒙允许提及一些难忘的事情来说明和证实。当天使和灵人朝向人时，他们不知道别的，只知道此人的语言是他们自己的、他们没有其它语言。因为此时他们进入此人的语言中，不在自己的语言中，甚至不记得自己的语言。不过，一旦转离此人，他们就会回到自己的天使的和属灵的语言中，对此人的语言则一无所知。当我与天使在一起、并处在类似于他们的状态时，我也曾有过类似的经历。当时，我用他们的语言与他们交谈，一点也不知道自己的语言，不记得它了。但是，一旦不再与他们在一起，我就又在自己的语言中。<br><br>
[2]另外值得一提的是，当天使和灵人朝向人时，他们可以在任何距离与人交谈。他们曾在远处和我说话，声音和在近处说话时一样响亮。但当他们转离人、彼此交谈时，人根本听不见他们在说什么，即使近在耳旁。由此清楚可知，在灵界，一切结合都取决于他们的朝向。<br><br>
[3]还有一事值得一提，就是许多灵人在一起，能与一个人交谈，而此人也能与他们一起交谈。因为他们差派他们当中的一员到他们想与之交谈的某个人那里，被差派的灵人将自己朝向那人，其他灵人则朝向他们差派的灵人，从而集中他们的思想，由被差派的灵人说出来。那时，这个灵人不知道别的，只认为他正出于自己说话，其他的灵人也不知道别的，只知道他们正在说话。如此，多位灵人与一个人的结合通过朝向他实现了。<a href="#a315">｛注1｝</a>关于这些特使灵人（也被称为代理），以及藉由他们的交流，将在后文详述。<a href="#a316">｛注2｝</a><br><br>
<a name="a314">｛注1｝</a>：从灵人社群被差派到其它社群的灵人被称为代理（<a href="../ac/4403.htm">4403</a>，<a href="../ac/5856.htm">5856</a>）。在灵界，交流通过这些特使灵实现（<a href="../ac/4403.htm">4403</a>，<a href="../ac/5856.htm">5856</a>，<a href="../ac/5983.htm">5983</a>）。被差派出去、充当代理的灵人出于差派他的灵人思考，而非出于他自己思考（<a href="../ac/5985.htm">5985</a>-<a href="../ac/5987.htm">5987</a>）。<br><br>
<a name="a321">｛注2｝</a>：【英160】参见下文<a href="../hh/601.htm">601</a>和<a href="../hh/603.htm">603:9</a>节。</p>
<p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>255. 为说明天使并灵人与人结合的性质, 我蒙允许述说一些难忘的事, 这些事有助于说明这个主题, 也有助于得出某些结论. 当天使和灵人转向人时, 他们只知道此人的语言是他们自己的, 他们没有其它语言. 因为在这种时候, 他们进入此人的语言, 甚至不记得自己的语言. 不过, 一旦转离此人, 他们就会回到自己的天使和属灵语言, 对此人的语言则一无所知. 当与天使在一起, 并处于类似他们的状态时, 我也曾有过这样的经历. 当时, 我以他们的语言与他们交谈, 对自己的语言却一无所知, 甚至不记得了. 但是, 一旦不与他们在一起, 我就又回到自己的语言.<br><br>另外, 值得一提的是, 当天使和灵人转向一个人时, 他们能在任何距离处与他交谈. 他们曾在相当远的距离处与我交谈, 和在旁边一样听得清清楚楚. 但是, 当他们转离人, 彼此交谈时, 人根本听不见他们在说什么, 即便近在耳旁. 由此清楚可知, 在灵界, 一切结合都取决于他们所面对的方向.<br><br>还有一事值得一提, 就是许多灵人能同时与一个人交谈, 而此人也能与他们一起交谈. 他们差遣他们当中的一员到他们想与之交谈的某个人那里, 被差遣的灵人转向那人, 其他灵人则转向他们的灵人, 从而集中他们的思维, 被差遣的灵人便说出这些思维. 那时, 这个灵人只知道他正出于自己说话, 他们也只知道他们正在说话. 数位与一位的结合也是通过他们所面对的方向实现的. 关于这些也被称为使臣的特使灵, 以及藉由他们的交流, 我们将在后面予以详述.<br><br>注: 从灵人社群被差遣到其它社群的灵人被称为使臣(<a href="../ac/4403.htm">天国的奥秘 4403</a>, <a href="../ac/5856.htm">5856</a>节). 在灵界, 交流通过这类特使灵实现(<a href="../ac/4403.htm">天国的奥秘 4403</a>, <a href="../ac/5856.htm">5856</a>, <a href="../ac/5983.htm">5983</a>节). 被差遣出去, 充当使臣的灵人出于差遣他的灵人, 而非他自己思考(<a href="../ac/5985.htm">天国的奥秘 5985-5987</a>节). </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>255. 為說明天人和靈與世人連接的情況, 我願述說一些難忘的經歷, 好讓大家有所啟發, 以得出一些結論。當天人和靈轉向我們時, 在他們看來, 我們的語言似乎屬於他們, 此外他們並無其它語言。因為此時, 他們進入我們的語言, 甚至忘了自己的語言。一旦轉離我們, 他們又回到自己心靈的語言, 對我們的語言一無所知了。當我和天人來往, 與他們處在相似的狀態時, 就有過這樣的經歷。當時, 我用他們的語言與其交流, 對自己的語言毫無所知, 全然遺忘了。一旦離開他們, 我又回到了自己的語言當中。<br><br>另外, 啟得一提的是, 當天人和靈轉向我們時, 能在很遠之外和我們說話。他們曾在遠處和我說話, 同樣振振有聲, 仿佛就在身旁。但是, 他們一旦轉身, 彼此交談時, 我們便一無所聞了, 即使近在耳旁, 也充耳不聞。我由此看出, 在靈界, 所有連接都取決於人所面對的方向。<br><br>還有一事啟得一提, 就是許多靈能同時和一個人對話。他們從中打發某個靈, 接近所欲交談的人。作為代表的靈轉向那人, 其他靈則面向代表靈, 集中他們的思維, 由代表靈表達。在代表靈看來, 他是本著自己說話, 在其他靈看來, 也是本著自己說話。如此, 根據所面對的方向, 多靈與一人的連接達成了。關於代表靈(他們被稱為"媒介")和通過他們達成交流的情況, 後文會有進一步介紹。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #255 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>255. To illustrate what the union of angels and spirits with us is like, I may cite a few memorable instances that will serve to illuminate the subject and enable some conclusions to be drawn. When angels and spirits turn toward us, it seems to them exactly as though our language were their own and that they have no other. This is because they are involved in our language at such times, and do not even remember their own. The moment they turn away from us, though, they are back in their own angelic and spiritual language and have no knowledge whatever of ours. The same thing has happened with me when I have been in the company of angels and in a state like theirs. Then I have talked with them in their language and knew nothing of my own. I could not even remember it. However, the moment I was no longer in their company I was back in my own language.<p> </p><p>[2] It is also worth noting that when angels and spirits turn toward us, they can talk with us even from a great distance. They have talked with me from far off just as audibly as though they were nearby. Still, when they turn away from us and talk with each other, nothing of what they say is audible to us even though this is happening right next to our ears. This has enabled me to see that in the spiritual world, all union depends on the way people are facing.<p> </p><p>[3] Again, it is worth noting that many of them can talk with one of us at the same time, and that person with them. They send some particular spirit from themselves to the individual with whom they want to talk, and this envoy spirit turns toward the person while the others turn toward their [envoy] spirit and so concentrate their thoughts, which the spirit then presents. It seems to such envoys entirely as though they were talking on their own, and to the others as though they themselves were. So a union of several with one is achieved by the way they face. <sup>1</sup>But we will say more later about these envoy spirits, called agents, and the communication that takes place through them. <br><br><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br><div><p>1.&nbsp;Spirits sent out by communities of spirits to other communities are called "agents": <a href="../ac/4403.htm">4403</a>, <a href="../ac/5856.htm">5856</a>. Communications in the spiritual world take place by means of such envoy spirits: <a href="../ac/4403.htm">4403</a>, <a href="../ac/5856.htm">5856</a>, <a href="../ac/5983.htm">5983</a>. Spirits who have been sent out and are serving as agents do not think on their own but from the spirits who sent them: <a href="../ac/5985.htm">5985-5987</a>. </p></div><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #255 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p>255. That the nature of the conjunction of angels and spirits with man may be understood, I am permitted to mention some notable things by which it may be illustrated and verified. When angels and spirits turn themselves to man they do not know otherwise than that the man's language is their own and that they have no other language, for then they are there in the man's language, and not in their own, which they do not remember. But as soon as they turn themselves away from the man they are in their own angelic and spiritual language, and know nothing about the man's language. I have had a like experience when in company with angels and in a state like theirs. I then talked with them in their language and knew nothing of my own, not remembering it. But as soon as I ceased to be in their company I was in my own language. <p> </p><p>[2] Another notable fact is that when angels and spirits turn themselves to a man they are able to talk with him at any distance. They have talked with me from a distance as audibly as when they were near. But when they turn themselves away from a man and talk with each other the man hears nothing at all of what they are saying, even if it be close to his ear. From this it was made clear that all conjunction in the spiritual world is determined by the way they turn. <p> </p><p>[3] Another notable fact is that many spirits together can talk with a man, and the man with them. For they send one of their number to the man with whom they wish to speak, and the spirit sent turns himself to the man and the rest of them turn to their spirit and thus concentrate their thoughts, which the spirit utters. The spirit then does not know otherwise than that he is speaking from himself, and they do not know otherwise than that they are speaking. Thus also is the conjunction of many with one effected by turning towards him. <sup>1</sup>But of these emissary spirits, who are also called subjects, and of communication by means of them, more will be said in subsequent pages. <br><br><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br><div><p>1.&nbsp;The spirits sent from societies of spirits to other societies are called subjects (<a href="../ac/4403.htm">Arcana Coelestia 4403</a>, <a href="../ac/5856.htm">5856</a>). <br><br>Communications in the spiritual world are effected by such emissary spirits (<a href="../ac/4403.htm">Arcana Coelestia 4403</a>, <a href="../ac/5856.htm">5856</a>, <a href="../ac/5983.htm">5983</a>). <br><br>A spirit when he is sent forth, and serves as a subject, thinks from those by whom he is sent forth, and not from himself (<a href="../ac/5985.htm">Arcana Coelestia 5985-5987</a>). </p></div><p align="center">------------</p>

<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #255 (original Latin)</h4><p>255. Ut sciatur qualis conjunctio angelorum et spirituum est cum homine, licet referre aliqua memoratu digna, ex quibus id illustrari et concludi potest. Quando angeli et spiritus se convertunt ad hominem, tunc non sciunt aliter quam quod hominis lingua sua sit, et quod illis non alia causa est, quia tunc in hominis lingua sunt, et non in sua, cujus nec recordantur: ut primum autem se convertunt ab homine, tunc in sua angelica et spirituali lingua sunt, nec sciunt quicquam de lingua hominis. Simile factum est mecum, cum in consortio fui cum angelis, et in simili statu cum illis tunc quoque locutus sum cum illis sua lingua, nec scivi quicquam de mea, cujus nec recordatus sum ut primum autem non cum illis in consortio fui, in mea lingua eram. Memoratu etiam dignum est, quod cum angeli et spiritus se convertunt ad hominem, loqui possint cum illo ad omnem distantiam; locuti etiam sunt mecum e longinquo aeque sonore sicut in propinquo; cum autem se convertunt ab homine, ac inter se loquuntur, quod prorsus nihil audiatur ab homine quid loquuntur, si vel id foret juxta ipsam aurem: inde patuit, quod omnis conjunctio in spirituali mundo sit secundum conversionem. Dignum etiam memoratu est, quod plures simul possint loqui cum homine, et homo cum illis; mittunt enim aliquem spiritum a se ad hominem, cum quo loqui volunt, et spiritus emissus se convertit ad illum, et plures illi ad suum spiritum, et sic concentrant suas cogitationes, quas spiritus profert spiritus tunc non aliter scit, quam quod ipse loquatur ex se, et illi non aliter quam quod ipsi ita fit conjunctio plurium cum uno etiam per conversionem. <sup>1</sup>Sed de Spiritibus his emissariis, qui etiam vocantur Subjecta et de communicatione per illos, in sequentibus plura dicentur.<br><br> <br><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br><div class="footnote-section"><br>1.&nbsp;Quod spiritus a societatibus spirituum emissi ad alias societates dicantur subjecta (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_255/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_4403" target=_top>4403</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_255/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_5856" target=_top>5856</a>).<br><br>Quod communicationes in mundo spirituali fiant per tales emissarios spiritus (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_255/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_4403" target=_top>4403</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_255/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_5856" target=_top>5856</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_255/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_5983" target=_top>5983</a>).<br><br>Quod spiritus, cum emissus est, et inservit pro subjecto, non cogitet ex se, sed ex illis, ex quibus emissus est (n.<br><br>5985-5987). </p>
