<h3 align="center" class="ired">《天堂与地狱》 第159节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>159、我曾被展示，当属天国度的天使处在三个不同的状态时，显为太阳的主在他们看来是怎样的形像。首先看见显为太阳的主闪耀着金红色的光芒，光彩异常，难以言表。我被告知，这就是天使在他们的第一状态时所看到的显为太阳的主的样子；后来，在太阳周围出现一个巨大而暗淡的光晕，使得原本灿烂辉煌的太阳开始变得暗淡。我被告知，当天使处在他们的第二状态时，太阳看上去便是这样；然后，我看见光晕逐渐变暗，太阳看上去光辉在减弱，逐渐地，直到最后它显得相当苍白。我被告知，当天使处在他们的第三状态时，太阳看起来就是这样。此后，就看见这白光向左朝着天堂的月亮移动，将自己加添到月光中，以至于月亮发出异乎寻常的光辉。我被告知，这是属天国度天使的第四状态，也是属灵国度天使的第一状态。状态的变化在这两个国度都是这样交替进行的，然而，不是同时在整个国度进行，而是一个社群接一个社群进行地。此外，我还被告知，这些变化不是固定的，而是在他们不经意间或迟或早地临到他们。<br><br>
天使还说，太阳本身既不改变也不移动，但它照着他们状态的持续发展而呈现这些外观，因为主照着各人的状态向各人显现：当人处在强烈的爱中，祂显得红光闪耀；随着人的爱减弱，炽热减退，直到最后当他的爱消退时，祂显得苍白。黑暗的光晕代表天使状态的品质，这光晕造成太阳的火焰和光芒有这些明显的变化。</p>

<p>159. 我被指示在属天国度, 当天使处于其第一, 第二和第三状态时, 显为太阳的主在他们眼中各是何形像. 我看见显为太阳的主一开始红光闪闪, 如此辉煌, 以至于无法形容. 我被告知, 当天使处于其第一状态时, 显为太阳的主在他们看来是这样. 后来, 这太阳周围出现一个巨大而暗淡的光晕, 使太阳如此辉煌的红光闪闪的品质因这光晕而开始暗淡. 我被告知, 当天使处于其第二状态时, 太阳在他们看来便是这样. 然后, 我看见光晕逐渐变暗, 以致太阳不再那么红光闪闪, 并且这一过程逐渐持续, 直到最后它显得相当亮白. 我被告知, 当天使处于其第三状态时, 太阳在他们看来就是这样. 此后, 我看见这亮白向左朝天堂的月亮移动, 增添了月亮的光芒, 以致这月亮显得格外明亮. 我被告知, 这是属天国度天使的第四个状态, 也是属灵国度天使的第一个状态; 状态的变化在这两个国度都是这样交替进行的; 然而, 不是同时在整个国度, 而是在一个接一个的社群中逐渐进行. 此外, 我还被告知, 这些交替不是固定的, 而是在他们不知不觉中或早或晚地临到他们. 天使继续说, 太阳本身既不改变也不移动; 但它照着他们状态的持续发展而具有这种表象, 因为主照着各人的状态向各人显现, 因此: 当人处于一种强烈的爱时, 祂显得红光闪闪, 随着人的爱消退便不再如此闪耀, 直到最后显得亮白. 各人状态的品质由造成太阳火焰和光芒表面变化的暗淡光晕来代表. </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>159. 我被指示仁智天國的天人在經歷前後三個狀態的過程中, 顯為太陽的主在他們眼中會發生怎樣的變化。當時, 我看到主顯為一輪太陽, 輝煌燦爛, 無以言啟。我被告知, 那是仁智天人在第一個狀態下, 顯為太陽的主在他們眼中的形像。接下來, 我看到一個巨大的光暈環繞著太陽, 使其輝煌燦爛的程度有所變淡。我被告知, 那是仁智天人在第二個狀態下所看到的太陽的模樣。後來, 我看到光暈逐漸變得黯淡, 以致燦爛的太陽最終顯得蒼白。我被告知, 那是仁智天人在第三個狀態下所看到的太陽的模樣。此後, 我看到蒼白的太陽向左朝天國的月亮移動, 增添了月亮的光芒, 使月亮顯得格外明亮。我被告知, 那是仁智天人的第四個狀態, 也是義信天人的第一個狀態。我還得知, 在每個國度, 狀態的變化不是同步進行的, 而是以社群為單位按順序進行的。我還被告知, 變化的過程不是固定的, 有時快, 有時慢, 天人難以覺察。<br><br>天人還說, 太陽本身並無變化, 也不曾移動, 使太陽看似變化的是天人生命狀態的改變。因為主在各人眼中的形像, 取決於各人的生命狀態。當仁愛濃烈時, 它顯得輝煌燦爛;當仁愛消退時, 它逐漸變淡直至蒼白。使太陽的火焰和光芒看似變化的光暈, 正好反映了他們生命狀態的品質。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #159 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>159. I have been shown how the Lord as the sun looks to angels in the heavenly kingdom in their first state, in their second state, and in their third. I saw the Lord as the sun, at first reddish and gleaming, so brilliant as to be beyond description. I was told that the Lord as the sun looks like this to angels in their first state. Later I saw a great, dim halo around the sun, because of which the reddish, gleaming quality that made the sun so brilliant began to dim. I was told that the sun looks like this to them in their second state. Then I saw the halo become darker so that the sun seemed less ruddy, step by step, until finally it looked quite pale. I was told that the sun looks like this to them in their third state. After this, I saw that pale [disk] move to the left toward heaven's moon and add its light to the light of the moon so that the moon shone exceptionally brightly. I was told that this was the fourth state of people in the heavenly kingdom and the first state of people in the spiritual kingdom. I was also told that the changes of state in each kingdom proceed alternately, not throughout, but in one community after another. I was also told that these alternations are not fixed, but happen more or less swiftly without people being aware of it. <br><br>Angels went on to say that the sun in and of itself neither changes nor moves, but that things look the way they do because of the ongoing progressions of state in themselves, since the Lord appears to each individual in keeping with that individual's state - reddish to people when they are in an intense love, less ruddy and ultimately pale as their love wanes. The quality of their state is pictured by the dim halo that imposes the apparent changes of flame and light on the sun. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #159 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p>159. I have been shown how the Lord, as a Sun, appears to the angels of the celestial kingdom in their first state, how in their second, and how in their third state. The Lord as a Sun was at first seen, golden red and glittering with a splendour that cannot be described. It was said that such was the appearance of the Lord as a Sun to the angels in their first state. Afterwards there appeared a great dark belt about the Sun and by this its first glow and brilliancy which gave it such splendour began to be dulled. It was said that such is the appearance of the Sun to them in their second state. Then the belt seemed by degrees to grow more dark and the Sun to appear less glowing, until at length it became quite white. It was said that such is the appearance of the Sun to them in their third state. After this, that whiteness was seen to move to the left towards the Moon of heaven, and to add itself to the light of it, in consequence of which the Moon then shone with unwonted splendour. It was said that such is the fourth state of those in the celestial kingdom and the first state of those in the spiritual kingdom, and that in both kingdoms changes of state have such alternations, although not in the whole kingdom at once, but in one society after another. Further it was said that these alternations are not fixed, but come upon them sooner or later without their knowledge. It was, moreover, stated that the Sun in itself is not thus changed or moved, but it takes on this appearance in accord with the successive progressions of their states since the Lord appears to every one in accord with what his state is, thus glowing when one is in intense love, and less glowing and finally white as his love subsides. The quality of each one's state is represented by the dark belt that induces upon the Sun these apparent variations in its flame and light. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #159 (Ager, 1900)</h4><p>159. I have been shown how the Lord as a sun appears to the angels of the celestial kingdom in their first state, in their second state, and in their third state. I saw the Lord as a sun, at first glowing and brilliant with a splendor that cannot be described; and I was told that such is the appearance of the Lord as a sun to the angels in their first state. Afterwards there appeared a great obscure belt about the sun, and by this its first glow and brilliancy, which gave it such splendor, began to be dulled, and I was told that such is the appearance of the sun to them in their second state. Then the belt seemed by degrees to grow darker, and the sun to appear less glowing, and this by degrees until at length it took on a shining whiteness; and I was told that such is the appearance of the sun to them in their third state. After this, that shining whiteness was seen to move to the left towards the moon of heaven, and to add itself to her light; and in consequence the moon shone forth with unwonted splendor; and I was told that such is the fourth state of those in the celestial kingdom and the first state of those in the spiritual kingdom, and that in both kingdoms changes of state have such alternations; yet not in the whole kingdom at once, but in one society after another. Furthermore, I was told that these alternations are not fixed, but come upon them sooner or later without their knowledge. And it was added that the sun in itself is not thus changed or moved; but it takes on this appearance in accord with their successive progressions of state, since the Lord appears to everyone in accord with what his state is, thus glowing when one is in intense love and less glowing and finally shining white as his love subsides; and the quality of each one's state was represented by the obscure belt that induced upon the sun these apparent variations in its glow and light. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #159 (original Latin)</h4><p>159. Ostensum mihi est, qualis Dominus ut Sol apparet angelis in regno caelesti in primo illorum statu, qualis in secundo, et qualis in tertio. Visus est Dominus ut Sol, primum rutilus et coruscans in tali splendore ut non describi possit; dicebatur quod Dominus ut Sol talis appareat angelis in primo eorum statu: postea visum est magnum cingulum obscurum circum Solem, per quod primum rutilum et coruscum, ex quo tantum splenduit, incipit hebescere dicebatur quod Sol illis talis appareat in altero statu dein visum est cingulum obscurescere magis, et Sol inde minus rutilus videri, et hoc per gradus, usque tandem ut factus sit sicut candidus dicebatur, quod talis appareat illis Sol in tertio statu: post haec visum est candidum illud progredi ad sinistrum versus Lunam caeli, et ejus lumini se addere, ex quo tunc Luna ultra modum exsplenduit: dicebatur quod id esset quartus status illis qui in regno caelesti, et primus illis qui in regno spirituali; et quod mutationes status in utroque regno ita vices alternent; at non in toto, sed in una societate post alteram tum quod vices illae non statae sint, sed superveniant serius aut citius illis nescientibus. Porro dicebant quod Sol in se non ita mutetur, nec ita progrediatur, sed quod usque ita appareat secundum statuum successivas progressiones apud illos, quoniam Dominus unicuivis secundum quale ejus status apparet, ita rutilus illis cum in intenso amore sunt; minus rutilus, et tandem candidus, cum amor decedit: et quod quale eorum status repraesentatum sit per cingulum obscurum, quod Soli apparentes illas variationes quoad flammam et lucem inducebat. </p>
