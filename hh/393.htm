<h3 align="center" class="ired">《天堂与地狱》 第393节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>393、那些在世时热爱圣经并从中热切地寻求真理的人，他们不以名利为目的，而是为了自己和他人对生命的功用，这些人在天堂里关心教会事务，他们在天堂里处在启示和智慧之光中的程度，与他们对功用的热爱和渴望的程度相一致。他们从天堂的圣经接受这智慧之光，这圣经是属灵的圣经，不是世上的那种属世的圣经（参看上文<a href="../hh/259.htm">259</a>节）。这些传道人在传道处，在那里，按照神性的秩序，那些从启示中获得超群智慧的天使，身居更高的地位。<br><br>
[2]有些天使，他们在世时，热爱自己的国家，热爱公共利益高于自己的利益，并出于对公义和公正的热爱而践行公义和公正，他们在天堂从事民政事务。他们出于爱的热忱而钻研公义的法律，并由此变得聪明，有能力在天堂履行这类职能。他们在适合其聪明才智的位置或程度履行这些职能，他们的聪明才智与他们为公共利益发挥功用的热爱相等。<br><br>
[3]此外，天堂里还有更多的职分、服务和行业，不胜枚举。相比之下，世上的却很少。但无论有多少人参与其中，他们都因热爱功用而以工作和劳动为乐，没有人以爱自己或爱利益为乐。而且，所有生活必需品都是免费赐予他们的，所以他们不必为生计而贪图利益。他们免费住宿，免费穿衣，免费吃饭。从这一切可以清楚地看出，那些爱自己和世界胜过爱功用的人和天堂无缘，因为人在世上的生活结束后，他的爱或情感会继续与他同在，永远也不会根除（参见上文第363节）。</p>
<p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>393. 在天堂, 从事教会事务的是那些在世时热爱圣言, 从中热切寻求真理, 不以名利为目的, 只为服务他们自己和别人的生活之人. 这些人在天堂便照其对功用的热爱和渴慕的程度而处于启示和智慧之光; 他们从天堂的圣言获得这智慧之光, 这圣言不是诸如世上的那种属世圣言, 而是属灵圣言(参看<a href="259.htm">259</a>节). 他们有讲道的恩赐; 按照神性秩序, 那些凭启示在智慧上超越他人的人身居更高职位.<br><br>从事社会事务的是那些在世时热爱自己的国家, 热爱公共利益高于个人利益, 并出于对公义, 公平的爱而行公平, 公义的人. 他们出于爱的热忱而钻研公正的法律, 并由此具有洞察力, 有能力在天堂履行这类职责. 他们在适合其洞察力的那个位置或层面履行这些职责, 其洞察力就等于他们因公共利益而对服务的爱.<br><br>此外, 天堂里的职能, 服务和职业如此众多, 根本无法一一列举. 相对来说, 世上的却极少. 不过, 无论有多少人参与, 他们都以自己的工作为快乐, 并出于对功用或服务的爱而工作, 没有人是出于对自我或利益的爱工作. 事实上, 一切生活必需品都白白地赐给他们, 所以他们没有为生活而对利益的爱. 他们白白地得到住房, 白白地得到衣服, 白白地得到食物. 由此可见, 那些爱自己, 爱世界胜过爱功用的人在天堂没有一席之地. 事实上, 人在世上的生活结束后, 他的爱或情感会与他同在, 永远不会根除(参看<a href="563.htm">563</a>节). </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>393. 在天國, 從事教會事務的是在世時曾熱愛聖言, 從聖言中殷勤尋找真理的人。他們不求名, 不求利, 只求自利利人。按照他們仁愛和樂意服事的程度, 他們獲得啟示, 處於智慧的光明之中。他們得以獲得光明, 是因為聖言在天國的心靈意義, 而非聖言在地上的物質意義(參<a href="259.htm">259</a>)。他們有講道的恩賜。照著神性的次序, 從啟示獲得更高智慧者也獲得更高的職位。<br><br>在天國, 從事社會事務的是在世時曾熱愛國家, 視公共福祉高於個人利益, 因熱愛公平正義而實踐公平正義的人們。憑著這份熱愛, 他們鑽研公正的法律, 獲得智慧, 有能力在天國履行政府性的事務。他們的職位高低取決於智慧的高低, 而智慧的高低又與其熱愛公共福祉的程度是相應的。<br><br>再者, 天國的職分, 職能, 職責之多, 根本無法一一列舉。相對而言, 人間的要少得多。不論多少人參與其中, 他們都以熱愛服務之心熱愛工作, 沒有人是出於自私, 或為著個人利益。事實上, 他們無需為生計而計較利益, 因為一切生活所需, 衣食住行, 都已白白地賜給他們。由此可見, 愛己愛物過於愛服務者, 在天國沒有立足之地。事實上, 人離開世界以後, 他的愛或欲望將隨他而去, 永遠無法根除(參<a href="363.htm">363</a>)。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #393 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>393. The people in heaven who are involved in church affairs are the ones who loved the Word in the world and looked for truths in it with lively interest, not for the sake of eminence or profit but for the service of their own life and the lives of others. In proportion to their love and eagerness for service, they are enlightened there and are in the light of wisdom, attaining it because of the Word in the heavens, which is not natural the way it is in the world, but spiritual (<a href="259.htm">259</a> above). They have the gift of preaching; and in keeping with the divine design, the ones who are more highly placed there are the ones who surpass others in the wisdom they derive from their enlightenment.<p> </p><p>[2] The people who are involved in civic affairs are the ones who loved their country and its welfare more than their own, who behaved honestly and fairly out of a love for what is honest and fair. To the extent that they sought out laws of justice because of the urging of this love and thereby became discerning they enjoy the ability to fill governing offices in heaven. They perform these duties in the place or on the level appropriate to their discernment, which in turn is equivalent to their love of service in the common good.<p> </p><p>[3] Further, there are so many offices and departments in heaven, so many tasks, that there are simply too many to list. There are relatively few in the world. No matter how many people are involved, they are all caught up in a love of their work and tasks out of a love of service - no one out of selfishness or a love of profit. In fact, there is no love of profit for the sake of livelihood, since all the necessities of life are given them gratis. They are housed gratis, clothed gratis, and fed gratis. We can see from this that people who have loved themselves and the world more than service have no place in heaven. In fact, our love or affection invariably stays with us after our life in the world. It is not uprooted to eternity (see above, <a href="363.htm">363</a>). </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #393 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p>393. Those who in the world have loved the Word and eagerly sought in it for truths, not with honour or gain as an end, but on account of uses of life both for themselves and for others, are concerned with ecclesiastical affairs in heaven. These in heaven are in enlightenment and in the light of wisdom in the measure of their love and desire for use; and this light of wisdom they receive from the Word in heaven, which is not a natural Word, as it is in the world, but a spiritual Word (see above, <a href="259.htm">259</a>). These minister in the preaching office; and in accordance with Divine order there, those who from enlightenment excel others in wisdom are in higher positions. <p> </p><p>[2] Those who in the world have loved their country, and have loved its general good more than their own, and have done what is just and right from a love of what is just and right, are concerned with civil affairs. So far as these from the eagerness of love have investigated the laws of justice and have thereby become intelligent, they have the ability to perform such functions in heaven, and they perform these in that position or degree that accords with their intelligence, their intelligence being in equal degree with their love of use for the general good. Furthermore, there are in heaven more functions and services and occupations than can be enumerated. <p> </p><p>[3] In the world there are few in comparison. But however many there may be who are so employed, they are all in the delight of their work and labour from a love of use, and no one from a love of self or of gain; and as all the necessaries of life are furnished them gratuitously they have no love of gain for the sake of a living. They are housed gratuitously, clothed gratuitously, and fed gratuitously. It is clear from all this that those who have loved themselves and the world more than use have no lot in heaven; for his love or affection remains with everyone after his life in the world, and is not extirpated to eternity (see above, <a href="363.htm">363</a>). </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #393 (Ager, 1900)</h4><p>393.

These in heaven are in enlightenment and in the light of wisdom in the measure of their love and desire for use; and this light of wisdom they receive from the Word in heaven, which is not a natural Word, as it is in the world, but a spiritual Word ((<a href="259.htm">Heaven and Hell 259</a><a href="259.htm">)</a> see above, <a href="259.htm">259</a>.) These minister in the preaching office; and in accordance with Divine order those are in higher positions who from enlightenment excel others in wisdom.<br><br>[2] Those are concerned with civil affairs who in the world loved their country, and loved its general good more than their own, and did what is just and right from a love for what is just and right.

They are housed gratuitously, clothed gratuitously, and fed gratuitously. Evidently, then, those that have loved themselves and the world more than use have no lot in heaven; for his love or affection remains with everyone after his life in the world, and is not extirpated to eternity (see above, <a href="563.htm">563</a>). </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #393 (original Latin)</h4><p>393. In ecclesiasticis sunt illi in caelo, qui in mundo Verbum amaverunt, et ex desiderio inquisiverunt ibi vera, non propter honorem aut lucrum, sed propter usum vitae et suae et aliorum illi secundum amorem et desiderium usus ibi in illustratione sunt ac in luce sapientiae, in quam etiam veniunt ex Verbo in caelis, quod non naturale est sicut in mundo, sed spirituale (videatur supra, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_393/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_259" target=_top>259</a>). Hi praedicatorum munere funguntur, ac ibi secundum ordinem Divinum in superiori loco sunt qui sapientia ex illustratione aliis praestant.<br><br> <br>[2] In civilibus sunt illi qui in mundo amaverunt patriam et ejus commune bonum prae suo, ac justum et rectum fecerunt ex amore justi et recti. Quantum hi ex amoris desiderio inquisiverunt leges justi, ac inde intelligentes facti sunt, tantum in facultate sunt administrandi officia in caelo, quae etiam administrant in eo loco aut gradu in quo est intelligentia eorum, quae etiam tunc in pari gradu est cum amore usus pro communi bono.<br><br> <br>[3] Praeterea in caelo tot officia et tot administrationes sunt, et quoque tot operae, ut enumerari ob copiam nequeant; in mundo sunt paucae respective. Omnes, quotcunque sunt, in jucundo sui operis et laboris sunt ex amore usus, et nemo ex amore sui aut lucri nec est alicui amor lucri ob vitam, quia omnes necessitates vitae illis gratis donantur; habitant gratis, vestiuntur gratis, vescuntur gratis. Ex quibus patet, quod qui amaverunt se et mundum prae usu, non in caelo aliquam sortem habeant: amor enim suus seu affectio sua manet unumquemvis post vitam in mundo, nec exstirpatur in aeternum (videatur supra, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_393/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_363" target=_top>363</a>). </p>
