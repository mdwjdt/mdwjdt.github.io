<h3 align="center" class="ired">《天堂与地狱》 第254节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>254、我被告知主是如何与先知说话并通过他们将圣经记录下来。主与他们说话不同于与古人：与古人说话是通过流注进入他们的内层，而与先知说话则通过差遣灵人到先知那里，主用自己的样子充满这些灵人，然后启示圣经，灵人再口授给先知。因此，这不是流注，而是直接的口谕。由于这些话都是直接从主那里发出的，因此每一句都充满了神性并包含内在的意义。天堂的天使理解这些话的属天和属灵意义，而世人则理解这些话的属世意义。这样，主便通过圣经将天堂与尘世结合起来。主如何通过祂的样式以神性充满灵人也已经解释了。一个被来自主的神性充满的灵人不知道别的，只知道自己就是主，是上帝在说话，这一直持续到他结束说话。然后，他感知并承认他是一个灵人，是出于主而非出于他自己说话。这就是与先知说话的灵人的状态，所以他们声称是耶和华在说话。这些灵人甚至称自己是耶和华，这不仅从圣经的先知书中得到证实，而且还可以从圣经的历史书中得到证实。</p>

<p>254. 我被告知主如何与先知说话, 通过他们将圣言记录下来. 主与他们说话的方式不同于与古人的, 与古人说话是通过进入他们内层的流注, 与先知说话则通过被差遣给他们的灵人; 主以其注视充满这些灵人, 从而以灵人吩咐给先知们的话启示他们; 因此, 这不是流注, 而是直接的吩咐. 由于这些话直接从主而来, 故其中的每句话都充满神性, 并包含一个内义在里面; 而内义具有这样的性质: 天堂天使理解这些话的属天和属灵意义, 而世人则理解这些话的属世意义. 这样, 主便通过圣言将天堂与世界联结起来. 我还被指示主如何通过其注视以神性充满灵人. 一个被主以神性充满的灵人只知道他就是主, 是神性在说话; 这一过程一直持续到他把话说完. 此后, 他发觉并承认他是一个灵, 是凭主, 而非他自己说话. 由于这就是与先知说话的灵人的状态, 所以他们声称是耶和华在说话; 这些灵人甚至自称耶和华, 这一点从圣言的预言和历史部分都能看出来. </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>254. 我被告知主是如何向先知說話, 並通過他們將聖言記錄下來的。主向他們說話不同于向古人說話, 向古人說話是流入他們的心, 而向這些先知說話是藉由所差來的靈。主通過顯現充滿這些靈, 將言語啟示於他們, 由他們轉告先知。由此可見, 這不是流入, 而是直接的曉諭。既是直接從主而來, 其中點滴皆充滿神性, 蘊含深意。仁智天人取其屬天之義, 義信天人取其屬靈之義, 世人則取其屬世之義;這樣, 主藉聖言將天國與人間連接起來。<br><br>我還被指示主是如何通過祂的臨在將神性充滿這些靈的。被主的神性充滿之靈以為自己就是主, 就是主在說話, 直到說話結束。此後, 他們發覺並承認自己是靈, 非憑自己說話, 而是憑主說話。在這種狀態下, 向先知說話的靈宣稱是耶和華在說話。事實上, 他們自稱"耶和華,"這從先知書和歷史書的記錄可知。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #254 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>254. I have also been shown how the Lord fills spirits with his divine nature by means of his appearance. Spirits filled with the Divine by the Lord have no sense whatever that they are not actually the Lord or that it is not the Lord who is speaking, which lasts as long as they are talking. Afterward they realize and admit that they are spirits and that they were not talking on their own, but from the Lord. <br><br>Because this was the state of the spirits who talked with the prophets, they themselves said that Jehovah was talking. The spirits actually called themselves "Jehovah," as can be seen not only in the prophetic books but also in the historical books of the Word. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #254 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p> 254. I have been told how the Lord spoke with the prophets through whom the Word was given. He did not speak with them as He did with the ancients, by an influx into their interiors, but through spirits who were sent to them, whom the Lord filled with His aspect, and thus inspired the words which they dictated to the prophets. So it was not influx but dictation. As the words came forth immediately from the Lord, therefore, each one of them was filled with the Divine and contains within it an internal sense, which is such that the angels of heaven perceive the words in a heavenly and spiritual sense, while men do so in a natural sense. Thus has the Lord conjoined heaven and the world by means of the Word. How spirits are filled with the Divine from the Lord by aspect has also been shown. A spirit filled with the Divine from the Lord does not know otherwise than that he is the Lord, and that it is the Divine that is speaking; and this continues until he has finished speaking. Afterwards he perceives and acknowledges that he is a spirit, and that he spoke from the Lord and not from himself. Because this was the state of the spirits who spoke with the prophets, they said that it was Jehovah who spoke; the spirits even called themselves Jehovah, as can be confirmed not only from the prophetical but also from the historical parts of the Word. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #254 (Ager, 1900)</h4><p>254. I have been told how the Lord spoke with the prophets through whom the Word was given. He did not speak with them as He did with the ancients, by an influx into their interiors, but through spirits who were sent to them, whom He filled with His look, and thus inspired with the words which they dictated to the prophets; so that it was not influx but dictation. And as the words came forth directly from the Lord, each one of them was filled with the Divine and contains within it an internal sense, which is such that the angels of heaven understand the words in a heavenly and spiritual sense, while men understand them in a natural sense. Thus has the Lord conjoined heaven and the world by means of the Word. How the Lord fills spirits with the Divine by His look has also been made clear. A spirit that has been filled by the Lord with the Divine does not know otherwise than that he is the Lord, and that it is the Divine that is speaking; and this continues until he has finished speaking. After that he perceives and acknowledges that he is a spirit, and that he spoke from the Lord and not from himself. Because this was the state of the spirits who spoke with the prophets they said that it was Jehovah that spoke; the spirits even called themselves Jehovah, as can be seen both from the prophetical and historical parts of the Word. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #254 (original Latin)</h4><p>254. Informatus sum quomodo Dominus locutus est cum prophetis, per quos Verbum. Non locutus est cum illis sicut cum antiquis per influxum in interiora eorum, sed per spiritus qui missi sunt ad illos, quos Dominus implevit suo aspectu, ac ita inspiravit verba quae prophetis dictabant; sic ut non esset influxus, sed dictamen: et quia verba ex Domino immediate proveniebant, ideo singula impleta sunt Divino, et in se continent sensum internum, qui talis est, ut angeli caeli percipiant illa in caelesti et spirituali sensu, cum homines in naturali; sic conjunxit Dominus caelum et mundum per Verbum. Quomodo spiritus implentur Divino a Domino per aspectum, etiam ostensum est. Spiritus impletus Divino a Domino non aliter scit, quam quod ille Dominus sit, et quod Divinum sit quod loquitur, et hoc eo usque dum elocutus est; postea appercipit et agnoscit quod spiritus sit, et quod ille non locutus sit a se sed a Domino. Quia talis status fuit spirituum, qui locuti sunt cum prophetis, ideo etiam ab illis dicitur quod Jehovah locutus sit; etiam ipsi spiritus se appellaverunt Jehovam ut constare potest non solum a propheticis sed etiam ex historicis Verbi. </p>
