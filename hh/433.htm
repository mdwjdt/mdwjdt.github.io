<h3 align="center" class="ired">《天堂与地狱》 第433节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>433、由于身体里活动的一切，以及来自这生命的行动和感觉，都只属于灵，无一属于身体，可见，灵才是人本身。换言之，人在自己身上看到的是一个拥有相似形体的灵；因为在人里面活动和感觉的一切都属于他的灵，所以，人里面的一切，从他的头到脚趾，都在活动并感觉。因此，当身体与它的灵分离——也就是所谓的“死亡”发生时，人仍是一个人，并继续活着。我从天堂听说，有些人死了，躺在棺材里，还没有复活进入灵界时，甚至在冰冷的身体里思考，不由得觉得自己还活着，只是不能移动属于身体的任何部分。</p>
<p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>433. 由于肉体里面活着的一切, 就是由于生命而行动并感知到的一切, 唯独属于灵, 无一属于肉体, 故可知, 灵就是这个人自己. 换言之, 人本身是一个拥有同样形式的灵; 因为凡在人里面活着并感知之物都属于他的灵, 人里面的一切, 从他的头到脚趾, 都是活着并有感觉的. 这就是为何当肉体脱离它的灵, 也就是所谓的死亡之时, 人仍是一个人, 并继续活着. 我从天堂听说, 有些死人躺在棺材里尚未苏醒之前, 甚至在其冷却的肉体中继续思想, 觉得自己仍旧活着, 只是无法移动属于肉体的一粒物质. </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>433. 既然人身上的一切活動, 感知全都屬於靈, 無一屬於肉體, 那麼靈就是實際上的人。換言之, 人本是靈, 有著與肉身一樣的形體。人身上的一切活動和感知都屬於靈;從頭到腳, 人沒有一處不具活力和感知能力。正因如此, 當人的肉體與靈魂脫離時, 也就是所謂的"死亡"發生時, 人依然是活生生的人。<br><br>在天國, 我聽說有些死去的人, 當他躺在棺材裡尚未蘇醒之前, 他依然在冷卻的肉體中思想, 感覺自己依然活著, 只是無法活動構成其肉體的物質罷了。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #433 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>433. Since everything that is alive in the body - everything that acts and feels because of life - belongs to the spirit alone and none of it belongs to the body, it follows that the spirit is the actual person. In other words, we are essentially spirits and have much the same form as well. You see, everything that is alive and sensitive within us belongs to our spirit, and there is nothing in us, from head to toe, that is not alive and sensitive. This is why when our bodies are separated from our spirits, which is called dying, we still continue to be human and to be alive. <br><br>I have heard from heaven that some people who die, while they are lying on the slab, before they have been revived, are still thinking in their cold bodies, and cannot help but feel that they are alive, but with the difference that they cannot move a single part of the matter that makes up their bodies. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #433 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p> 433. As everything in the body that lives, and that acts and feels from that life, belongs exclusively to the spirit, and nothing of it to the body, it follows that the spirit is the man himself; or what is the same thing, that a man viewed in himself is a spirit and is also in like form. For whatever lives and feels in man is his spirit, and everything in man, from his head to the sole of his foot, lives and feels. In consequence, when the body is separated from its spirit, which is what is called dying, man continues to be a man and to live. I have heard from heaven that some who die, while they are lying upon the bier before they have been resuscitated, think even in their cold body, and do not know but that they are still alive, except that they are unable to move a particle of matter belonging to the body. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #433 (Ager, 1900)</h4><p>433. As everything in the body that lives, and that acts and feels from that life, belongs exclusively to the spirit, and nothing of it to the body, it follows that the spirit is the man himself; or what is the same thing, that a man viewed in himself is a spirit possessing a like form; for whatever lives and feels in man belongs to his spirit and everything in man, from his head to the sole of his foot, lives and feels; and in consequence when the body is separated from its spirit, which is what is called dying, man continues to be a man and to live. I have heard from heaven that some who die, while they are lying upon the bier, before they are resuscitated, continue to think even in their cold body, and do not know that they are not still alive, except that they are unable to move a particle of matter belonging to the body. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #433 (original Latin)</h4><p>433. Quoniam omne quod vivit in corpore, et ex vita agit et sentit, unice est spiritus, et nihil corporis, sequitur quod spiritus sit ipse homo seu quod simile, quod homo in se spectatus sit spiritus, et quoque in simili forma: nam quicquid vivit et sentit in homine est ejus spiritus, et nihil non in homine a capite ad plantam pedis ejus vivit et sentit inde est, quod, cum separatur corpus ab ejus spiritu, quod dicitur mori, homo maneat usque homo, et vivat. Audivi e caelo, quod quidam qui moriuntur, cum jacent super ferali mensa, antequam resuscitati sunt, in suo frigido corpore etiam cogitent, nec sciant aliter quam quod adhuc vivant, sed cum differentia, quod non possint aliquam particulam materialem, quae propria corporis est, movere. </p>
