<h3 align="center" class="ired">《天堂与地狱》 第10节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>10、一些灵人生活在世上时，确信他们所行的良善和所信的真理都出于自己，或归功于自己，这也是那些将功德置于善行之中并自以为义的人所相信的，这些人不被天堂所接受。天使避开他们，认为他们既是傻瓜又是窃贼：说他们傻是因为他们不断地关注自己而不是上帝；说他们是贼，是因为他们窃取主功。这些人反对天堂之信，即与天使同在的主的神性创造了天堂。</p>
<p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>10. 活在世上时确认以下信仰的灵人不会被接入天堂, 即: 他们所行的良善和所信的真理皆来自他们自己, 或被当作他们自己的而归于他们; 这就是所有将功德置于善行, 自称为公义之人的信仰. 天使避开他们, 视他们为愚昧和窃贼: 愚昧是因为他们不断关注自己, 不关注神性; 窃贼是因为他们将主的东西从祂那里夺走. 这些人反对天堂的信仰, 即: 主在天使里面的神性构成天堂. </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>10. 有些靈在世時確信他們所行之善和所信之理皆出於自我, 或者將這些美德歸為己有, 他們不為天國所接收。凡是以功利心行善並因行善而自以為義的人, 都抱有這樣的觀念。天人避開他們, 視他們為愚為賊——愚, 因為他們只看自己, 不顧上天;賊, 因為他們竊取主之善理為己有。從主發出, 流入天人的神性形成天國, 于此天理, 他們持反對意見。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #10 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>10. Spirits who during their earthly lives had convinced themselves that they were the sources of the good they did and the truth they believed, or who had claimed these virtues as their own, are not accepted into heaven. This is the belief of all those who place merit in good deeds and claim to be righteous. Angels avoid them. They regard them as stupid and as thieves - stupid because they are constantly looking at themselves and not at the Divine, and thieves because they take from the Lord what is actually his. They stand in opposition to heaven's belief that the Lord's divine nature in angels is what makes heaven. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #10 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p>10. Such spirits as have confirmed themselves during their life in the world in the belief that the good that they do and the truth that they believe are from themselves or are appropriated to them as their own-which is the belief of all who attach merit to good actions and claim righteousness to themselves-are not received into heaven. The angels avoid them, regarding them as stupid and as thieves, stupid because they continually have themselves in view and not the Divine, thieves because they would take away from the Lord that which is His. These are opposed to the faith of heaven that the Divine of the Lord present with the angels makes heaven. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #10 (Ager, 1900)</h4><p>10. Such spirits as have confirmed themselves during their life in the world in the belief that the good they do and the truth they believe is from themselves, or is appropriated to them as their own (which is the belief of all who place merit in good actions and claim righteousness to themselves) are not received into heaven. Angels avoid them. They look upon them as stupid and as thieves; as stupid because they continually have themselves in view and not the Divine; and as thieves because they steal from the Lord what is His. These are averse to the belief of heaven, that it is the Divine of the Lord in the angels that makes heaven. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #10 (original Latin)</h4><p>10. Spiritus, qui dum in mundo vixerunt, in illa fide se confirmaverunt, quod bonum quod faciunt et verum quod credunt, sint a semet, aut appropriata sibi ut sua, in qua fide sunt omnes illi qui meritum ponunt in beneactis, ac justitiam sibi vindicant, illi non recipiuntur in caelum; angeli illos fugiunt, spectant illos ut stupidos ac ut fures, ut stupidos quia jugiter spectant ad se et non ad Divinum, ut fures quia auferunt Domino quod Ipsius est. Hi contra fidem caeli sunt, quod Divinum Domini apud angelos faciat caelum. </p>
