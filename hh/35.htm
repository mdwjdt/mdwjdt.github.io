<h4 align="center"></h4><p>35、由于这种区别，这一层天堂的天使不能到另一层天堂的天使当中，也就是说，低层天堂的天使不能上到高层天堂，高层天堂的天使也不能下到低层天堂。低层天堂的天使若上到高层天堂，就会感到苦恼，甚至痛苦至极，无法看见那里的天使，更不用说与他们交谈了；从高层天堂下来的天使则丧失智慧，说话结结巴巴，陷入绝望。有些外层天堂的天使，还没有被被教导过是天使的内层构成天堂，他们相信只要进入高层天使所在的天堂就能获得高层天堂的幸福。他们便被允许进入这些天使当中，但到了那里以后，尽管有一大群天使在场，也无论他们如何寻找，他们却看不见一个天使，因为新来者的内层没有像那里天使的内层在同样的层级被打开，因而他们的视觉也没有这样被打开。不久，他们心如刀绞，几乎不知道自己是否还活着。于是，他们急忙回到自己原来的天堂，很高兴回到自己的同伴当中，发誓不再贪图与自己的生命不一致的更高级的事物。<br><br>
我还看见一些天使从高层天堂下来，他们的智慧被剥夺，直到他们不再知道原先的天堂是什么样子。而当主将一些天使从低层天堂提入高层天堂、好叫他们能看到它的荣耀时（这种事经常发生），情况就不同了。那时，低层天堂的天使会在事先预备好，并被中间天使围绕着，通过中间天使来交流。从这一切可以明显地看出，这三层天堂彼此完全不同。</p>
<p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>35. 由于这种区别, 这一层天堂的天使不能去往另一层天堂的天使当中, 也就是说, 没有人能从低层天堂上去, 也没有人能从高层天堂下来. 从低层天堂上去的人必感到悲伤, 甚至痛苦至极, 也不能看见那里的天使, 更不能与他们交谈; 从高层天堂下来的天使则丧失智慧, 拙口笨舌, 陷入绝望. 有些来自最外层天堂的天使, 尚未被指教天使的内层构成天堂, 以为只要进入高层天使所在的天堂, 就能获得高层天堂的幸福. 他们便被允许进入这类天使当中, 但到了那里以后, 却一个天使也没看见, 无论他们如何寻找, 尽管有一大群天使在场. 因为新来者的内层没有被打开到那里天使的内层所在的层级, 因而他们的视觉也没有被打开. 此后不久, 他们心里感到极度痛苦, 以至于几乎不知道自己是否还活着. 于是, 他们赶紧回到他们所来的天堂, 庆幸回到自己的同伴当中, 发誓不再贪图与自己的生活不一致的更高事物. 我又看见一些天使从一个高层天堂下来, 丧失了自己的智慧, 直到他们不再知道自己的天堂是什么. 当主将一些天使从低层天堂提入高层天堂, 好叫他们能看到它的荣耀(这种事经常发生)时, 情况就不同了. 那时, 他们会事先得到预备, 并被居间天使包围, 通过居间天使实现交流. 由此明显可知, 这三层天堂彼此完全不同. </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>35. 由於這種差別, 某層天國的天人不能獲許進入另一層天:更低層天國的天人不能上來, 更高層天國的天人不能下來。任何一位從低層天上來, 會感到焦慮, 甚至痛苦, 看不見那裡的人, 更別說與他們交談了。任何一位從高層天下來, 必要折損智慧, 變得拙口笨舌, 也喪失自信。<br><br>有外層天的天人, 由於尚未領悟天國在心內, 以為只要准許進入更高的天國就能享受更大的快樂, 便被允許上去訪問。孰料到達以後, 儘管周圍有很多天人, 他們卻一無所見, 因為他們的內在尚未被打開到相應的層次。不久, 他們感到心如刀絞, 甚至不知自己是生是死。於是他們趕緊回到自己的天國, 慶倖回到了同伴當中, 且發誓不再奢望超出自己層次的境界。<br><br>若是主將他們提到更高的天國, 好讓他們瞻仰其中的榮美(此事時有發生), 情況就不同了。他們事先會受到預備, 並被提供居間的天人作為交流的媒介。<br><br>從上述事實可知, 三層天是截然劃分的。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #35 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>35. Because of this difference, an angel of one heaven cannot gain admission to angels of another heaven: someone from a lower heaven cannot come up, nor can someone from a higher heaven come down. Anyone who comes up is seized by anxiety even to the point of pain and cannot see the people who are there, let alone talk with them. Anyone who comes down from a higher heaven loses his or her wisdom, stammers, and loses confidence. <br><br>There were some people from the outmost heaven who had not yet been taught that heaven is a matter of angels' deeper qualities, but believed that they would find greater angelic happiness if only they were admitted to the heaven where these angels lived. They were allowed to visit them, but when they arrived, even though there were a great many angels there, they did not see anyone no matter where they looked. The deeper levels of the newcomers had not been opened at the level where the more inward angels lived, so they had no sight. Before long, they were seized by heart pain and eventually could scarcely tell whether they were still alive or not. So they quickly made their way back to the heaven they had come from, and were delighted to be among their own people. They vowed that they would never again crave conditions that were higher than the ones that suited their own way of life. <br><br>It is different when the Lord raises people from a lower heaven into a higher one so that they can see its splendor, which happens quite often. Then they are prepared in advance and provided with mediating angels who serve as agents of communication. <br><br>We can see from all this that the three heavens are quite distinct from each other. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #35 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p>35. Because such distinction exists, an angel of one heaven cannot go among the angels of another heaven, that is, no one can ascend from a lower heaven, neither can anyone descend from a higher heaven. One ascending from a lower heaven is seized with a distress amounting to anguish and is unable to see those who are there, still less can he talk with them, while one descending from a higher heaven is deprived of his wisdom, hesitates in his speech and gives up in despair. There were some from the outermost heaven, who had not yet been taught that heaven is established in the interiors of an angel, and who believed that they might come into a higher heavenly happiness simply by access to a heaven where higher angels are. They were even permitted to enter among such angels, but when they were there, they saw no one however much they searched, although there was a great multitude present. For the interiors of the newcomers had not been opened in the same degree as the interiors of the angels there, consequently neither was their sight opened. Shortly after this, they were seized with such anguish of heart that they scarcely knew whether they were alive or not. Therefore they hastily betook themselves to the heaven from which they came, glad to come again among their own companions, and promising that they would no longer desire things higher than are in agreement with their life. Again, I have seen some sent down from a higher heaven, and deprived of their wisdom until they no longer knew what their own heaven was. It happens otherwise when, as is often done, the Lord raises some angels out of a lower into a higher heaven that they may behold its glory. Then they are prepared beforehand, and are encompassed by intermediate angels through whom there is communication. From all this it is evident that the three heavens are entirely distinct one from another. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #35 (Ager, 1900)</h4><p>35. Because of this distinction an angel of one heaven cannot go among the angels of another heaven, that is, no one can ascend from a lower heaven and no one can descend from a higher heaven. One ascending from a lower heaven is seized with a distress even to anguish, and is unable to see those who are there, still less to talk with them; while one descending from a higher heaven is deprived of his wisdom, stammers in his speech, and is in despair. There were some from the outmost heaven who had not yet been taught that the interiors of angels are what constitute heaven, and who believed that they might come into a higher heavenly happiness by simply gaining access to a heaven where higher angels are. These were permitted to enter among such angels. But when they were there they could see no one, however much they searched, although there was a great multitude present; for the interiors of the newcomers not having been opened in the same degree as the interiors of the angels there, their sight was not so opened. Presently they were seized with such anguish of heart that they scarcely knew whether they were alive or not. Therefore they hastily betook themselves to the heaven from which they came, glad to get back among their like, and pledging themselves that they would no longer covet higher things than were in agreement with their life. Again, I have seen some let down from a higher heaven; and these were deprived of their wisdom until they no longer knew what their own heaven was. It is otherwise when, as is often done, angels are raised up by the Lord out of a lower heaven into a higher that they may behold its glory; for then they are prepared beforehand, and are encompassed by intermediate angels, through whom they have communication with those they come among. From all this it is plain that the three heavens are entirely distinct from each other. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #35 (original Latin)</h4><p>35. Quia tale discrimen est, non potest angelus unius caeli intrare ad angelos alterius caeli, seu non potest aliquis ex interiori caelo ascendere nec aliquis ex superiori caelo descendere: qui ex inferiori caelo ascendit, corripitur anxietate usque ad dolorem, nec potest videre illos qui ibi, minus loqui cum illis; et qui ex superiori caelo descendit, privatur sua sapientia, titubat voce, et desperat. Fuerunt quidam ex ultimo caelo, qui nondum instructi erant quod caelum consisteret in interioribus angeli, credentes quod in superiorem felicitatem caelestem venirent, modo in caelum ubi illi angeli; permittebatur etiam ut ad illos intrarent, at cum ibi erant, neminem videbant utcunque inquirerent, tametsi magna multitudo erat; advenarum enim interiora non aperta erant in tali gradu in quo interiora angelorum qui ibi, inde nec visus; et paulo post corripiebantur angore cordis, usque adeo ut vix scirent num in vita essent vel non; quapropter subito inde se contulerunt ad caelum unde erant, gavisi quod inter suos venirent; spondentes quod non amplius cuperent altiora, quam quae vitae eorum concordant. Vidi etiam demissos e caelo superiori, et privatos sua sapientia, usque ut nescirent quale esset quum caelum. Secus fit, cum Dominus elevat aliquos ex inferiori caelo in superius, ut videant gloriam ibi, quod fit saepius; tunc praeparantur primum, et stipantur angelis intermediis per quos communicatio. Ex his patet quod tres illi caeli inter se distinctissimi sint. </p>
