<h4 align="center"></h4><p>331、孩子们在来世的状态要远远超过他们在尘世的状态，因为他们没有穿上尘世的肉体，而是拥有像天使那样的身体。尘世的肉体本身是粗糙的，是从外在或尘世获得自己的初始感觉和运动，而不是从内在或灵界。所以在尘世，必须教会孩子走路、引导他们的动作和说话，甚至他们的视觉和听觉也必须通过使用来开启，在来世的孩子则不是这样。由于他们是灵人，他们根据自己的内层即刻行动，不经练习就能行走，也能交谈，虽然他们最初是出于一般的情感，还没有区分为思想观念，但他们很快就进入这些，因为他们的外层与内层性质一致。天使的语言（参看<a href="../hh/234.htm">234</a>-<a href="../hh/245.htm">245</a>节）也是从情感流出的，因其思想观念的不同而各不相同，所以他们的言语完全符合来自情感的思想。</p>

<p>331. 来世孩子的状态远远胜过尘世孩子的, 因为他们没有披上尘世的肉体, 而是拥有如天使那样的身体. 尘世肉体本身是粗糙而沉重的, 并且不是从内在世界或灵界, 而是从外在世界或自然界获得自己的初始感觉和初始动作; 所以, 尘世的孩子必须通过练习才能学会行走, 做事, 说话; 甚至他们的感觉, 如视觉和听觉, 也必须通过使用被打开, 发展. 而来世的孩子则不然. 他们是灵人, 故直接受其内层驱使, 无需练习就会行走, 也会说话, 尽管一开始只是出于笼统的情感, 尚未细化为思维观念. 但他们很快就进入后者, 因为他们的外层与内层和谐一致. 天使的言语(参看<a href="234.htm">234-245</a>节)也是从情感流出的, 因其思维观念而各不相同, 所以他们的言语完全符合其出于情感的思维. </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>331. 進入心靈世界的孩子, 其條件要遠勝物質世界中的孩子, 因為他們沒有物質的身體, 而是天人那樣的身體。物質之身生來是沉重的, 其主要的知覺和反應都來自外部世界(或物質世界), 而非內在世界(或心靈世界)。所以物質世界中的孩子得通過練習來學會走路, 說話, 行事, 甚至視覺, 聽覺等官能也是在運用的過程中發展起來的。進入心靈世界的孩子卻不同, 因為他們是靈, 其行為直接受內在秉性所驅使, 無需練習, 他們就能行走甚至說話, 儘管一開始只是籠統的情感流露, 尚未細化為思想觀念。但是他們很快就能進入狀態, 因為他們的內在與外在是協調一致的。天人的語言也是從情感流出, 經思想觀念而呈現種種不同的形式, 所以他們的語言與情感所生的思想是完全一致的(參<a href="234.htm">234-245</a>節)。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #331 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>331. The condition of children in the other life is vastly better than that of children in our world because they are not clothed with an earthly body. Instead, they have an angelic one. An earthly body is inherently heavy. It does not receive its primary sensations and primary impulses from the inner or spiritual world but from the outer or natural one; so children in this world learn by practice to walk, to do things, and to talk - even their senses, such as sight and hearing, are developed by use. It is different for children in the other life. Because they are spirits, their actions are impelled directly by their inner natures. They walk without practice and even talk, though at first this is just a matter of general affections as yet undifferentiated into mental concepts. However, they are very soon introduced into these latter as well, since their outer natures are in such concord with their inner natures. Then too, angels' speech flows from their affections, varied by the concepts of their thought, so that their speech is in perfect agreement with the thoughts that arise from their affections (see <a href="234.htm">234-245</a> above). </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #331 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p> 331. The state of little children in the other life far surpasses their state in the world, for they are not clothed with an earthly body, but with one like that of an angel. The earthly body is in itself gross, and receives its first sensations and motions not from the inner or spiritual world, but from the outer or natural world. In consequence, little children in this world must be taught to walk, to make gestures and to speak; and even their senses, as seeing and hearing, must be opened by use. It is different with little children in the other life. As they are spirits, they act at once in accordance with their interiors, walking without practice, and also talking, though at first from general affections not yet distinguished into ideas of thoughts; but they are quickly initiated into these also, for the reason that their exteriors are homogeneous with their interiors. The speech of angels (as may be seen above, <a href="234.htm">234-245</a>) so flows forth from affections modified by ideas of thought that their speech completely conforms to their thoughts from affection. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #331 (Ager, 1900)</h4><p>331. The state of children in the other life far surpasses their state in the world, for they are not clothed with an earthly body, but with such a body as the angels have. The earthly body is in itself gross, and receives its first sensations and first motions not from the inner or spiritual world, but from the outer or natural world; and in consequence in this world children must be taught to walk, to guide their motions, and to speak; and even their senses, as seeing and hearing, must be opened by use. It is not so with children in the other life. As they are spirits they act at once in accordance with their interiors, walking without practice, and also talking, but at first from general affections not yet distinguished into ideas of thought; but they are quickly initiated into these also, for the reason that their exteriors are homogeneous with their interiors. The speech of angels (as may be seen above, n, <a href="234.htm">234-245</a>) so flows forth from affection modified by ideas of thought that their speech completely conforms to their thoughts from affection. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #331 (original Latin)</h4><p>331. Status infantum in altera vita multum praestat statu infantum in mundo, nam non induti sunt corpore terrestri, sed simili quo angeli. Corpus terrestre in se grave est, non recipit ab interiori seu spirituali mundo primas sensationes et primos motus, sed ab exteriori seu naturali mundo quare infantes in mundo discent <sup>1</sup>gradi, gestus agere, et loqui; immo aperientur illis sensus, ut visus et auditus, per usum: aliter infantes in altera vita illi quia spiritus sunt, agunt statim secundum interiora sua, gradiuntur absque usu, loquuntur etiam, sed primum ex communibus affectionibus nondum ita distinctis in ideas cogitationum, ast brevi in has quoque initiantur, et hoc quia exteriora eorum sunt homogenea interioribus. Quod loquela angelorum fluat ex affectionibus variegatis per ideas cogitationis, sicut loquela eorum sit <sup>2</sup>prorsus conformis cogitationibus ex affectione, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_331/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_234" target=_top>234-245</a>).<br><br> <br><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br><div class="footnote-section"><br>1.&nbsp;gradi pro "gradiri"<br><br>2.&nbsp;sit pro "fit" </p>
