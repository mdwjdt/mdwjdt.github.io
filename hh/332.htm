<h3 align="center" class="ired">《天堂与地狱》 第332节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>332、小孩子死后立即苏醒，一苏醒就被带进天堂，托付给女天使，她们活在肉身时，温柔地爱小孩子，同时又热爱上帝。因为她们在世时以母亲般的温柔疼爱所有的孩子，所以她们接受这些新来的孩子，视为己出；而孩子们出于天性，也爱她们就像爱自己的母亲一样。每位天使照顾的孩子的数量正如她的属灵的家长情感所期望的一样多。该天堂出现在前额的前面，正好在天使仰望主的视线上或半径范围内。<a href="#a409">｛注1｝</a>它之所以在这个位置，是因为所有小孩子都在主的直接眷顾之下，流入他们的，是纯真天堂，也就是第三层天堂。<br><br>
<a name="a409">｛注1｝</a>：这种描述特定天堂的位置，或者更确切地说是描述天堂的一个特定部分的方式，源自上面第<a href="../hh/59.htm">59</a>-<a href="../hh/67.htm">67</a>中提出的模式（标题为“整个天堂呈人形”），尤其是第<a href="../hh/65.htm">65</a>节。</p>
<p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>332. 小孩子一苏醒(死后随即发生)就被带进天堂, 交给活在肉身时既温柔疼爱孩子, 同时又敬爱神的女天使. 她们因在世时以母亲的温柔疼爱一切孩子, 故将这些新来者视为己出; 而孩子出于与生俱来的本能, 也爱她们如自己的母亲. 这样的天使出于一种属灵的母性情感想要多少孩子, 就可抚养多少孩子. 该天堂可见于额头的前方部位, 正好在天使仰望主的视线上或半径范围内. 它之所以占据如此位置, 是因为所有小孩子都在主的直接眷顾之下; 流入他们的, 是纯真天堂, 也就是第三层天堂. </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>332. 孩子一蘇醒(死後隨即發生), 就被帶到天國, 交給在世時既疼愛孩子也敬愛上帝的女性天人。他們在世時曾以溫柔的母愛疼愛一切孩子, 故將這些新來者視為己出。孩子也回以愛, 將其視為生母, 仿佛這是本能。這樣的天人, 照其母性所願, 可撫養足啟多的孩子。<br><br>該天國可見于額頭的前方部位, 剛好在天人瞻視主的視線上。其位置如此, 乃因孩子處於主的直接眷顧之下。流入他們的是天真之天, 亦即第三層天。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #332 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>332. As soon as children are reawakened (which happens immediately after their death), they are taken to heaven and given to female angels who had loved children tenderly during their physical lives and had loved God as well. Since in this world they had loved all children with a kind of maternal tenderness, they accept these new ones as their own, and the children love them as their mothers as though this were inborn in them. Each such angel has as many children as her spiritual maternal nature wants. <br><br>This heaven can be seen in the forward part of the forehead, directly on the line or radius along which angels look at the Lord. The reason for this location is that children are under the direct care of the Lord. Into them flows the heaven of innocence, which is the third heaven. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #332 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p>332. As soon as little children are resuscitated, which takes place immediately after death, they are taken into heaven and confided to angel women who, in the life of their body, tenderly loved little children and at the same time loved God. Because these during their life in the world loved all children with a kind of motherly tenderness, they receive them as their own; while the children, from an implanted disposition, love them as their own mothers. There are as many children in each one's care as she desires from a spiritual parental affection. This heaven appears in front before the forehead, directly in the line or radius in which the angels look to the Lord. It is so situated because all little children are under the immediate auspices of the Lord; and the heaven of innocence, which is the third heaven, flows in with them. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #332 (Ager, 1900)</h4><p>332. As soon as little children are resuscitated, which takes place immediately after death, they are taken into heaven and confided to angel women who in the life of the body tenderly loved little children and at the same time loved God. Because these during their life in the world loved all children with a kind of motherly tenderness, they receive them as their own; while the children, from an implanted instinct, love them as their own mothers. There are as many children in each one's care as she desires from a spiritual parental affection. This heaven appears in front before the forehead, directly in the line or radius in which the angels look to the Lord. It is so situated because all little children are under the immediate auspices of the Lord; and the heaven of innocence, which is the third heaven, flows into them. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #332 (original Latin)</h4><p>332. Infantes ut primum exsuscitati sunt, quod fit statim post obitum, auferuntur in caelum, et traduntur angelis qui ex sexu feminino sunt, quae in vita corporis suI tenere amaverunt infantes, et simul amaverunt Deum. Hae quia in mundo ex teneritudine quasi materna omnes infantes amaverunt, recipiunt illos sicut suos, et infantes quoque ex indole insita amant illas sicut suas matres: totidem infantes sunt apud <sup>1</sup>unamquamvis, quot ex spirituali storge desiderat. Hoc caelum apparet antrorsum e regione frontis, directe in linea seu radio quo angeli spectant Dominum situs illius caeli ibi est, quia omnes infantes sub immediato auspicio Domini sunt influit etiam apud illos caelum innocentiae, quod est caelum tertium.<br><br> <br><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br><div class="footnote-section"><br>1.&nbsp;unamquamvis pro "unumquamvis" </p>
