<h3 align="center" class="ired">《天堂与地狱》 第121节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>121、然而，当主显现在天堂时（这是常有的事），祂并没有显为被太阳包围的样子，而是以天使的样子出现，然而，凭祂脸上闪耀的神性而与众天使有区别。因为主本人并不在那里，因为祂本人始终被太阳包围着，但看上去祂显现在天堂那里。因为在天堂里这是常见的事，即人们看似出现在视线的终端或固定的地方，即便这个地方与他们实际所在的地方非常遥远。这种同在被称为内在视觉的同在，这将在以后进一步讨论。<a href="#a181">｛注1｝</a>我也曾见过主在太阳外以天使的形像出现，就在太阳稍下面的高处；还看见祂以类似的形象出现在附近，脸上发光；又有一次看见祂在众天使当中，如同火焰般的发光。<br><br>
<a name="a179">｛注1｝</a>：见下文第<a href="../hh/147.htm">147</a>节。在《属天的奥秘》（<a href="../ac/6849.htm">6849</a>）中进一步阐述了通过内在视觉而同在的主题：“主只通过内在视觉与人同在，出于对别人仁爱的信仰使这内在视觉成为可能。”</p>
<p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>121. 然而, 当主出现在天堂(这种事经常发生)时, 祂看上去并非被一轮太阳环绕, 而是以天使的形式出现, 却又凭祂脸上所闪耀的神性而与众天使区别开来. 事实上, 主本人并不在那里, 因为祂本人始终被太阳环绕; 但祂以表象出现. 在天堂, 人们看似出现在视线所聚焦或固定的地方, 即便这个地方距离他们实际所在之地非常遥远; 这是很平常的事. 他们的出现被称为内视的出现; 对此, 下文会予以论述. 我还看见主以天使的形式从太阳出来, 就在太阳稍向下的高处; 还看见祂以类似形式在附近, 脸面发光; 又有一次看见在众天使中间, 如同一道火焰般的光辉. </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>121. 不過, 當主在天國之中顯身時(這是常有的事), 祂並非以太陽的形像出現, 而是以天人的形像出現。祂臉上散發的神聖氣質, 將祂與天人分別出來。但並非事實上祂親身在那裡(因為主的"親身"是指太陽環繞的主), 只是以表像顯現而已。在天國, 遠在天邊的事物看似近在眼前, 這是很平常的事。這種顯現稱為"在內視中顯現,"關於這一點, 後文會有進一步的討論。<br><br>另外, 我曾看見主在太陽之外的空中顯為一個天人的樣式, 也曾看見祂在近處以類似的樣式顯現, 甚至有一次顯在一些天人當中, 光芒四射。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #121 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>121. However, when the Lord appears in heaven (which happens quite often) he does not appear clothed with the sun but in an angelic form, distinguishable from the angels by the divine quality that shines from his face. He is not actually there in person - since the Lord "in person" is always clothed with the sun - but is present in appearance. It is commonplace in heaven for things to be seen as though they were present in the place where their appearance is focused or delineated, even though this is very far from the place where they themselves actually are. This presence is called "a presence of inner sight," and will be discussed further below. <br><br>Then too I have seen the Lord outside the sun in an angelic form overhead, a little below the sun, and also nearby in a similar form - once even among some angels, looking like a fiery ray of light. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #121 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p>121. When, however, the Lord appears in heaven, which often happens, He does not appear encompassed with a Sun, but in Angelic form, yet distinguished from angels by the Divine shining from His face. For He is not there in person since the Lord in person is always encompassed with the Sun, but He is present by view. For it is a common occurrence in heaven for persons to appear to be present in a place where the view is fixed or terminated, even when the place is very far from where they really are. This presence is called the presence of internal sight, which will be treated of in what follows. I have also seen the Lord on high, outside the Sun in an angelic form a little below the Sun, also near by in a similar form with shining face, also once in the midst of angels as a flame-like brightness. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #121 (Ager, 1900)</h4><p>121. When, however, the Lord appears in heaven, which often occurs, He does not appear encompassed with a sun, but in the form of an angel, yet distinguished from angels by the Divine shining through from His face, since He is not there in person, for in person the Lord is constantly encompassed by the sun, but He is present by look. For it is a common occurrence in heaven for persons to appear to be present in a place where their look is fixed or is terminated, even when this place is far away from where they really are. This presence is called the presence of internal sight, which will be treated of further on. I have also seen the Lord out of the sun in an angelic form, at a height a little below the sun; also near by in a like form, with shining face, and once in the midst of angels as a flame-like radiance. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #121 (original Latin)</h4><p>121. Cum autem Dominus apparet in caelo, quod saepius fit, non apparet cinctus Sole, sed in forma Angelica, distinctus ab angelis per Divinum translucens e facie non enim ibi est in persona, nam Dominus in persona constanter est circumdatus Sole, sed est in praesentia per aspectum; in caelo enim commune est, quod appareant sicut praesentes in loco ubi figitur seu terminatur aspectus tametsi id sit longissime a loco ubi actualiter sunt praesentia illa vocatur praesentia visus interni, de qua in sequentibus. Visus etiam est Dominus mihi extra Solem in forma Angelica paulo infra Solem in alto; et quoque prope in simili forma, facie lucente; semel etiam in medio angelorum ut jubar flammeum. </p>
