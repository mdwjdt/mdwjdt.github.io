<h3 align="center" class="ired">《天堂与地狱》 第470节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">四十九、人死后的状态取决于他在世上的生活</h4><br><br>
470、每一个基督徒都从圣经中知道，自己的生命在死后仍然存在，因为许多经文都说，各人将要按照他的行为和作为，受审判，得奖赏，任何一个从良善和真正的真理去思考的人，必然看到，生活良善者上天堂，生活邪恶者下地狱。但是，邪恶的人不愿意相信他死后的状态取决于他在世上的生活，宁愿相信（尤其是在患病时）天堂是出于纯粹的怜悯被恩赐给每个人的，无论他过着什么样的生活。这是按照他的与生活分离的信仰来行的。</p>
<p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>470. 四十九, 人死后的性质取决于他在世上所过的生活<br><br>每个基督徒都从圣言知道, 死后, 人自己的生活等待着他; 因为圣言多处说到人将照他的行为和作为受审判, 得报应. 此外, 凡基于良善和真正的真理思考的人必然看出, 生活良善者上天堂, 生活邪恶者下地狱. 但恶人却不愿相信其死后的状态取决于他在世上的生活, 情愿认为(尤其患病时), 天堂出于纯粹的怜悯被恩赐给每个人, 无论他过着什么样的生活; 这是照他的信仰来想的, 因为他将信仰与生活分离开来. </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>470. 世上生活決定死後景況<br><br>基督徒從聖言得知, 人死後其生命將要延續, 因為聖言多處說到人將照各自的行為受審判, 得報應。再者, 出於善和理進行思考的人, 不難看出生活良善者上天國, 生活敗壞者下地獄。反之, 喜歡作惡的人卻不願相信其死後的狀態取決於今生的生活方式。他們情願相信(特別是身體開始衰退的時候), 上天國純粹在於上天的憐憫, 人的行為無關緊要, 只要信就已足啟。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #470 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>470. Our Nature after Death Depends on the Kind of Life We Led in the World <br><br>Any Christian knows from the Word that our life is still with us after death, since it says in many places that we will be judged according to our deeds and works and rewarded accordingly. Further, anyone who thinks on the basis of what is good and from real truth cannot help but see that people who live well enter heaven and people who live evil lives enter hell. However, people who are intent on evil do not want to believe that their state after death depends on their life in the world. They think rather, especially when their health begins to fail, that heaven is granted to all on the basis of mercy alone no matter how people have lived, and that this depends on a faith that they keep separate from life. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #470 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p>470. MAN AFTER DEATH IS SUCH AS HIS LIFE HAD BEEN IN THE WORLD <br><br>Every Christian knows from the Word that one's own life remains after death; for it is there said in many passages that man will be judged and rewarded according to his deeds and works; and no one who really thinks from good and from its truth can help seeing that he who lives well comes into heaven and he who lives wickedly into hell. But the evil man is unwilling to believe that his state after death is according to his life in the world; he thinks, especially when he is sick, that heaven is granted to everyone out of pure mercy, whatever his life may have been, and that this is done in accordance with his faith, which he separates from life. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #470 (Ager, 1900)</h4><p>470. MAN AFTER DEATH IS SUCH AS HIS LIFE HAD BEEN IN THE WORLD.<br><br>Every Christian knows from the Word that one's own life awaits him after death; for it is there said in many passages that man will be judged and rewarded according to his deeds and works; and no one who thinks from good and from real truth can help seeing that he who lives well goes to heaven and that he who lives wickedly goes to hell. But the evil man is unwilling to believe that his state after death is according to his life in the world; he thinks, especially when he is sick, that heaven is granted to everyone out of pure mercy, whatever his life may have been, and that this is done in accordance with his faith, which he separates from life. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #470 (original Latin)</h4><p>470. [XLIX.] QUOD HOMO SIT POST MORTEM, QUALIS EJUS VITA FUIT IN MUNDO.<br><br>Quod vita unumquemvis sua maneat post mortem, notum est cuivis Christiano ex Verbo nam ibi multis in locis dicitur, quod homo secundum facta et opera judicabitur, et ei retribuetur quisque etiam qui ex bono et ex ipso vero cogitat, non videt aliter quam quod qui bene vivit, in caelum veniat, et qui male in infernum. At vero qui in malo est, is non credere vult, quod status ejus post mortem sit secundum vitam ejus in mundo, sed cogitat, quod fit imprimis cum aegrotat, quod caelum sit cuivis ex pura misericordia, utcunque vixerat, et quod sit secundum fidem, quam separat a vita. </p>
