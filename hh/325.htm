<h3 align="center" class="ired">《天堂与地狱》 第325节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>325、一天早晨，远处传来合唱的声音，从合唱团的形象中我得知他们是中国人，因为他们展示了一种毛山羊的形象，然后是一块小米饼、一只乌木勺和一座漂城的形象。<a href="#a403">｛注1｝</a>他们渴望走近我，当我们在一起时，他们说，他们想和我单独在一起，以便透露自己的想法。但他们被告知，他们并不孤单，他们想独处会让别人感到不悦，尽管他们是客人。当他们察觉到这种不快时，他们开始想他们是否得罪了邻舍，是不是将属于别人的东西据为己有。在来世，所有的思想都在交流中，我被允许感知他们心中的不安。它包括认识到了他们有可能伤害了那些感到不悦的人，并为此感到羞愧，以及其他有价值的感情。由此可知他们有仁爱的特质。此后不久，我与他们交谈，最后谈到主。当我称主为“基督”时，我感知到他们有某种抵触，不过，原因被披露了，也就是说，他们从世上带来了这种反感，因为他们在世时了解到基督徒缺乏仁爱，过着比他们还糟糕的生活。但当我简单地称祂为“主”的时候，他们却深受感动。后来，天使们教导他们说，基督教的教义比世界上其它任何教义都要求爱和仁，但只有很少人遵守它。一些非基督徒在世时从交往和传闻中得知，基督徒过着败坏的生活，沉迷于奸淫、仇恨、争吵、酗酒等等，他们自己憎恶这些，因为这些事违背他们的宗教信仰。在来世，这些人对接受信之真理比其他人更胆怯。但天使教导他们说，基督教的教义以及信仰本身所教导的生活完全不是这样，只是基督徒不像非基督徒那样照着教义去生活。当他们认识到这一点时，他们就接受信仰的真理，敬拜主，但不像其他人那么容易。<br><br>
<a name="a403">｛注1｝</a>：【英215】在其它地方瑞典伯格说到，在灵界，人的思想和联想明显地投射在他的周围。《属天的奥秘》（<a href="../ac/6200.htm">6200</a>）解释说，无论人在想什么，在灵界都是作为一个中心来表现的，围绕着这个中心，可以看到他曾经关联的一切。例如，当瑞典伯格想到某个人时，此人的形像出现在中间，从小对于此人所曾知道和思想的相关的一切则在此人形像的周围，看起来像一只上下翻动的鸟的翅膀。在这里，瑞典伯格根据所看到的人群周围的形像来确定这个群体的国籍。</p>

<p>325. 一天清晨, 我远远听见合唱声. 根据合唱团的形像, 我判断他们是中国人, 因为他们展现出一种毛山羊, 一块小米糕和一个乌木勺, 还展现出一座浮城的形像. 他们渴望走近我, 当我们在一起时, 他们说, 他们想和我单独在一起, 以便透露自己的想法. 但他们被告知, 我们不能单独在一起; 他们想单独在一起会让别人感到不悦, 尽管他们是客人. 当他们觉察到这种不悦时, 开始思考他们是不是得罪了邻舍, 是不是将属于别人的东西据为己有. 在来世, 一切思维都被交流, 所以我被允许觉察他们心中的不安. 这种不安在于认识到他们有可能伤害了那些感到不悦的人, 并为此感到羞愧, 连同其它具有诚实人特征的情感; 由此可知他们被赋予了仁爱. 此后不久, 我与他们交谈, 最后谈到主. 当我称主为“基督”时, 我在他们里面感觉到一种厌恶; 不过, 原因被揭开, 即: 他们从世上带来这种厌恶感, 因为他们已经获知基督徒过着比他们还糟糕的生活, 缺乏仁爱. 但当我简单地称祂为“主”时, 他们却深受感动. 后来, 天使教导他们说, 基督教的教义比全世界任何其它教义都要求爱和仁, 只是很少有人照此生活. 一些非基督徒在世时从交往和传闻就已知道, 基督徒过着败坏的生活, 沉迷于奸淫, 仇恨, 争吵, 酗酒等等; 这让他们大为震惊, 因为像这样的事违背他们的宗教信仰. 在来世, 这些人对接受信之真理比其他人更犹豫不决. 但天使告诉他们说, 基督教的教义, 以及信仰本身所教导的生活完全不是这样, 只是基督徒不像非基督徒那样照着他们的教义去生活. 当他们认识到这一点时, 便接受信之真理, 崇拜主, 只是不如其他人那么容易. </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>325. 一日清晨, 我聽到從遠處傳來和聲。從他們的模樣, 我判斷是中國人, 因為我看見山羊, 小米糕, 烏木勺和一座浮城的像。他們渴望走近我, 走近以後, 他們說想和我私下交談。但是他們被告知, 我們無法單獨相處, 這對別人是一種冒犯, 因為他們只是客人。當他們發覺自己有所冒犯, 將他人之物當作己有時(在心靈世界, 人的思想是相通的), 心緒隨即變了。我感覺到他們心中的不安, 他們唯恐自己冒犯了鄰人, 慚愧之心油然而生, 此外還夾雜著誠實人的其它情感特徵。其仁愛的心腸, 由此可見一斑。<br><br>此後不久, 我與他們交談, 最後提到了主。當我稱主為"基督"時, 我感覺到一種抵觸的情緒。原來, 他們在世的時候, 發現基督徒過著敗壞的生活, 缺乏仁愛的心腸, 還不如他們。後來, 當我稱主為"主"時, 他們卻深受感動。之後, 天人告訴他們, 其實基督教比任何宗教更要求仁愛, 只可惜照此而行的人並不多。<br><br>一些非基督徒生前曾聽說基督徒過著腐敗的生活——姦淫, 仇恨, 爭吵, 酗酒, 等等, 這讓他們震驚, 因為這些惡行皆與其信仰相悖。正因如此, 他們對是否接受信之真理猶豫不決。天人告訴他們, 基督教的教義和信仰其實十分高尚, 只可惜基督徒不如非基督徒那樣遵行自己的信仰。當他們瞭解了這一點, 就欣然接受信之真理, 尊主為聖。不過這需要一定的時間。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #325 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>325. One morning I heard a far off chorus. I could tell from images of the chorus that they were Chinese, since they presented to view a kind of woolly goat and a cake of millet and an ebony spoon, as well as an image of a floating city. They were eager to come closer to me, and when we were together they said that they wanted to be alone with me in order to disclose their thoughts. They were told, however, that we were not alone, and that the others were offended that they wanted to be alone, since they were guests. When they perceived this feeling of offense in their thoughts, their mood changed, since they had transgressed against a neighbor, and since they had claimed as their own something that belonged to others (in the other life, all our thoughts are shared). I was enabled to perceive their distress of mind. It involved a recognition that they might have injured them, and a sense of shame on that account, along with other emotions characteristic of honest people, so that you could tell they were endowed with thoughtfulness. <br><br>I talked with them shortly afterward, and eventually mentioned the Lord. When I called him "Christ," I could sense a kind of resistance in them. The reason for this was uncovered, though. This derived from their experience in the world, from their having known that Christians lived worse lives than they did, lives devoid of thoughtfulness. When I simply mentioned "the Lord," though, they were deeply moved. Later they were taught by angels that Christian doctrine more than any other in the whole world demands love and thoughtfulness, but that there are not many people who live up to it. <br><br>There are non-Christian individuals who during their earthly lives have learned by hearsay that Christians live evil lives - lives of adultery, hatred, bickering, drunkenness, and the like - which appalled them because things like this are contrary to their religion. In the other life they are particularly hesitant about accepting truths of faith. However, they are taught by angels that the Christian doctrine and the faith itself teach something very different, but that Christians do not live up to their doctrines as much as non-Christian people do. When they grasp this, they accept truths of faith and worship the Lord, but only after quite a while. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #325 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p> 325. A choir at a distance was heard one morning. From the choir's representations I was permitted to know that they were Chinese, for they exhibited a kind of woolly goat, then a cake of millet, and an ebony spoon, also the idea of a floating city. They desired to come nearer to me, and when they had joined me they said that they wished to be alone with me, that they might disclose their thoughts. But they were told that they were not alone, and that some were displeased at their wishing to be alone, although they were guests. When they perceived this displeasure they began to think whether they had transgressed against the neighbour, and whether they had claimed anything to themselves that belonged to others. All thought in the other life being communicated, I was permitted to perceive the agitation of their minds. It consisted of a recognition that possibly they had injured those who were displeased, of shame on that account, together with other worthy affections; and it was thus known that they were endowed with charity. Soon after, I spoke with them, and at last about the Lord. When I called Him "Christ" I perceived a certain repugnance in them; but the reason was disclosed, namely, that they had brought this from the world, from their having learned that Christians lived worse lives than they did, and without charity. But when I called Him simply "Lord" they were interiorly moved. Afterwards, they were taught by the angels that the Christian doctrine beyond every other in the world prescribes love and charity, but that there are few who live in accordance with it. There are gentiles who have come to know while they lived in the world, both from intercourse and report, that Christians lead evil lives, are addicted to adultery, hatred, quarrelling, drunkenness, and the like, which they themselves abhor because such things are contrary to their religious beliefs. These in the other life are more timid than others about accepting the truths of faith; but they are taught by the angels that the Christian doctrine, as well as the faith itself, teaches a very different life, but that the lives of Christians are less in accord with their doctrine than the lives of gentiles. When they recognize this they receive the truths of faith, and adore the Lord, but less readily than others. </p><p align="center">------------</p>

<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #325 (original Latin)</h4><p>325. Unus chorus ad distantiam auditus fuit quodam mane; ex chori repraesentationibus cognoscere datum est, quod essent Chinenses; sistebant enim speciem hirci lanati, tum placentam ex miliis, et cochleare <sup>1</sup>ebenum, ut et ideam urbis natatilis. Desiderabant propius ad me venire, et cum se applicarent, dicebant quod soli apud me esse vellent, ut sua cogitata aperirent. Sed dicebatur eis, quod soli non essent, et quod alii qui indignantur quod soli esse vellent, cum tamen hospites. Indignatione eorum percepta, in cogitationem lapsi sunt, num <sup>2</sup>praevaricati sint contra proximum, et num quicquam sibi vindicaverint quod aliorum esset; (cogitationes in altera vita omnes communicantur;) commotionem animi eorum percipere datum est; erat agnitionis quod forte illos laeserint, tum pudoris inde, et una aliarum affectionum probarum; inde quod charitate essent praediti, cognoscebatur. Mox locutus sum cum illis, tandem etiam de Domino: cum Ipsum nominarem Christum, repugnantia quaedam apud eos percepta est; sed causa detegebatur, quod traxerint id e mundo, ex eo quod noverint Christianos pejus vivere quam illi, et in nulla charitate; at cum Dominum simpliciter nominarem, tunc interius commoti sunt. Instruebantur dein ab angelis, quod Christiana doctrina prae omni alia in universo orbe amorem et charitatem praescribat, sed quod pauci sint qui secundum illam vivunt. Sunt Gentiles, qui, cum vixerunt in mundo, ex conversatione et fama cognoverunt quod Christiani malam vitam agant, ut in adulteriis, in odiis, in rixis, in ebrietate, et similibus, quae illi horruerunt, quia talia contra eorum religiosa. illi in altera vita aliis timidiores sunt recipiendi vera fidei. Sed instruuntur ab angelis, quod doctrina Christiana, ac ipsa fides, prorsus aliud doceat; at quod illi minus quam Gentiles secundum doctrinalia vivant quae cum appercipiunt, vera fidei recipiunt, et Dominum adorant, sed serius.<br><br> <br><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br><div class="footnote-section"><br>1.&nbsp;"ebenum:"--sic editio princeps.
