<h3 align="center" class="ired">《天堂与地狱》 第518节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>518、有些灵人在世时就曾思考过并确信自己会进入天堂，在众人面前蒙接纳，因着他们的学问和渊博的圣经和教会教义方面的知识，也因此他们相信自己是智慧的，正是经上所说的智慧人：<br><br>
他们必发光，如同天上的光；必发光如星星。（<a href="http://www.39-27.cn/但12.3.htm">但以理书12:3</a>）<a href="#a521">｛注1｝</a><br><br>
但对这些人进行了检查，看看他们的思想是留在记忆中还是在生命中。其中一些人真正爱慕真理，也就是说，拥有功用，这些功用不以身体和世俗为目的，本质上是属灵的。这些人接受教导后，就被接收到天堂。然后，他们得以知道在天上发光的即功用中的神性真理（也就是天堂之光），功用就是接受那光线并将它们转化为各种光辉的平面。但有些人的认知仅仅停留在记忆中，他们由此获得一种能力，即能推论真理，并证明他们已经接受的东西是基本原则，这些原则被他们确认后，当作真理，即使它们是伪谬的。这些人根本不在天堂之光中，而是被包裹在骄傲的信念当中。很多学者都有这种骄傲的信念，以为比别人更有学问，会因此进入天堂，被天使服侍。<br><br>
为了使他们能远离虚妄的信仰，他们被带到第一层或最外层天堂，被领进一个天使社群。但就在入口处，他们的眼睛因着天堂之光的流注而开始变暗，他们的理智也被扰乱了，最终他们开始气喘吁吁，如同濒临死亡；而且，他们一感受到天堂的热，也就是天堂的爱，就开始深受折磨。因此，他们被驱逐出来。后来他们被教导：造就成天使的，并不是认知，而是通过认知所获得的生命本身，因为认知本身在天堂之外，而通过认知所获得的生命则在天堂之内。<br><br>

<p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>518. 有些灵人在世时不断思想, 以至于确信他们会进入天堂, 并先于其他人蒙接纳, 因为他们受过良好的教育, 对圣言和教会的教义知之甚详. 他们相信自己很有智慧, 正是经上所说“必发光如同天上的光, 必发光如星”(<a href="3927/daniel_12_3.htm">但以理书 12:3</a>)所指的人. 然而, 他们接受检查, 以查看他们的学问是居于记忆, 还是居于生活. 其中有些人对真理拥有真正的情感, 也就是拥有脱离纯肉体和世俗动机的功用, 这些功用本质上是属灵的功用; 他们接受教导后, 就被接入天堂. 那时, 他们得以知道是什么在天上发光, 即功用中的神性真理, 也就是天堂之光, 这就是接受那光线并将它们转化为各种光辉的层面. 但有些人的学问仅居于记忆, 他们由此获得一种能力, 即: 能推理真理, 并证明他们早已当作原则来接受的东西; 这类原则经他们确认之后, 就被当成真理, 即便它们是虚假. 这些人根本没有处于天堂之光, 而是陷入源于通常依附于这类聪明的骄傲的信仰, 即: 他们比别人更有学问, 会因此进入天堂, 被天使服侍. 为使他们能摆脱其狂妄的信仰, 他们被提到第一层或最外层天堂, 被引入一个天使社群. 但就在入口处, 他们的眼睛开始因天堂之光的流注变暗, 他们的理解力开始变得混乱, 最终他们开始呼吸困难, 如同垂死之人. 不仅如此, 他们一感受到天堂之热, 也就是天堂之爱, 就开始感到深深的痛苦. 因此, 他们被逐出, 后来被教导: 构成一位天使的, 并不是知识, 而是通过知识所获得的生活本身, 因为就其本身而言, 知识在天堂之外; 而通过知识所获得的生活则在天堂之内. </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>518. 有的靈確信自己比別人更有資格進入天國, 因為他們受過良好的教育, 對聖言和教會的教義知之甚詳。他們相信自己很有智慧, 正是聖言所說"必要發光, 如同天上的光"(<a href="3927/daniel_12_3.htm">但以理書12:3</a>)的聰明人。他們受到審視, 以確認其學問是存於記憶中, 還是已融入生活中。<br><br>有些靈對真理有著真正的渴慕之情, 也就是他們有所"用,"此"用"不以肉體和塵世為目標, 本質上就是心靈之"用"。這樣的靈一經受教, 就被接入天國。然後, 他們得以認識何為天國中發光之物, 其實就是聖理(天國之光)之"用,""用"成為接受聖理之光線的載體, 並將其轉化為各樣光彩。<br><br>但是, 有些人的學問只是被存入記憶中。他們培養了一種能力, 能對真理進行論證, 證明他們所接受的屬乎真理。即使是一些錯誤的觀點, 一旦為他們所證實, 也看似正確無誤。此等人並不在天國的光明之中, 而是被包裹在驕傲的信念當中。很多有學問的人都有這種驕傲心理, 以為自己配得天國, 能得到天人的服侍。為使他們擺脫這種狂妄的信念, 他們被帶到第一層天(或外層天), 進入某個天人社群當中。正進入時, 隨著天國之光的流入, 他們的眼睛變得模糊, 理智變得混亂, 最終呼吸變得困難, 仿佛將死之人。不僅如此, 隨著天國的溫暖(即天國之仁)流入, 他們感到巨大的痛苦。於是他們被打發離開, 並被告知:成就天人的不是知識, 而是透過知識所養成的真實生活。因為就其本身而言, 知識是在天國之外, 唯有通過知識所培養的生活才在天國之內。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #518 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>518. There were some spirits who while they were in the world had thought their way into the conviction that they would get into heaven and would be accepted before anyone else because they were well educated and knew a lot about the Word and the doctrine of the churches. They believed that they were wise, that they were the people meant by the prophecy in <a href="3927/daniel_12_3.htm">Daniel 12:3</a> that "they will shine like the glory of the firmament and like the stars." However, they were examined to see whether their learning was lodged in their memories or in their life. The ones who had a real affection for truth - that is, for the sake of constructive acts apart from merely physical and worldly motives, acts that were essentially spiritual - once they had been instructed, were accepted into heaven. They were then granted knowledge of what does shine in heaven. It is the divine truth (which is heaven's light there) in constructive living, this being the facet that receives that light and turns it into various kinds of radiance. <br><br>For others, though, the learning was lodged only in their memories. They had thereby acquired an ability to reason about truths and to prove the ones they accepted as fundamental, notions that looked true once they were proved, even though they were false. These people were not in heaven's light at all, but were wrapped up in a faith based on the pride that characterizes so many people of like intelligence, a pride in being especially erudite and therefore destined for heaven where they will be waited on by angels. Because of all this, to extract them from their conceited faith, they were taken up to the first or outmost heaven to be admitted into one particular angelic community. Even as they were entering it, though, their sight began to darken at the inflow of heaven's light. Then their intellects began to be confused, and eventually they began to labor for breath as though they were dying. Not only that, when they began to feel heaven's warmth, which is heavenly love, they began to feel profound agonies. So they were expelled, and then were taught that knowledge does not make an angel, only the actual life that people have gained through their knowledge. This is because in and of itself, knowledge is outside of heaven; but a life gained through knowledge is inside heaven. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #518 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p> 518. There were some spirits who had convinced themselves, by thinking about it in the world, that they would come into heaven and be received before others because of their learning and their great knowledge from the Word and from the doctrines of the Churches, believing that they were wise in consequence, and were such as are meant by those of whom it is said that <br><br>They shall shine as the brightness of the firmament, and as the stars. <a href="3927/daniel_12_3.htm">Daniel 12:3</a>. <br><br>But these were examined to see whether their thoughts resided in the memory or in the life. Those who had a genuine affection of truth, that is, who had uses separated from what pertains to the body and the world as their end, which are essentially spiritual uses-when they had been instructed, were received into heaven; and it was then given them to know what it is that shines in heaven, namely, Divine Truth (which is the light of heaven) in use, which is a plane that receives the rays of that light and turns them into various splendours. But those with whom cognitions resided merely in the memory, and who had acquired therefrom an ability to reason about truths and to prove what they had already accepted as principles, seeing such principles, after they had confirmed them, as truths, although they were falsities-these, as they were in no heavenly light, and yet were in a belief derived from the conceit that usually adheres to such intelligence that they were more learned than others, and would for that reason come into heaven and be served by the angels, in order that they might be withdrawn from their delusive faith, were taken up to the first or outermost heaven to be introduced into an angelic society. But at the very threshold their eyes began to be darkened by the inflowing of the light of heaven, and their understanding to be disturbed, and at length they began to gasp as if at the point of death; and as soon as they felt the heat of heaven, which is heavenly love, they began to be inwardly tormented. They were therefore cast down, and afterwards were instructed that cognitions do not make an angel, but the life itself, which is gained by means of cognitions, for cognitions regarded in themselves are outside heaven; but life acquired by means of cognitions is within heaven. </p><p align="center">------------</p>

<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #518 (original Latin)</h4><p>518. Fuerunt spiritus, qui ex cogitatione in mundo sibi persuaserunt, quod in caelum venturi essent, et prae aliis reciperentur, quia docti fuerunt, et sciverunt multa ex Verbo, et ex doctrinis ecclesiarum credentes sic quod sapientes essent, et quod intellecti sint per illos de quibus dicitur, quod fulgerent sicut splendor expansi et sicut stellae (apud <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_518/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_daniel_12_3" target=_top>Danielem 12:3</a>): sed explorati sunt, num cogitationes illorum residerent in memoria, vel num in vita. illi qui in affectione veri genuina fuerunt, ita propter usus separatos a corporeis et mundanis, qui in se sunt usus spirituales, postquam instructi sunt, etiam recepti sunt in caelum et tunc datum est illis scire, quid splendet in caelo, quod nempe sit Divinum Verum, quod ibi est lux caeli, in usu, qui est planum quod recipit radios illius lucis, et in splendores varios vertit. illi autem apud quos cognitiones modo residebant in memoria, et inde comparata est facultas ratiocinandi de veris, ac confirmandi illa quae receperunt ut principia, quae tametsi falsa, post confirmationem viderunt sicut vera illi, quia in nulla luce caeli fuerunt, et tamen in fide ex fastu, qui plerumque tali intelligentiae adhaeret, quod doctiores aliis essent, et sic venturi in caelum, et quod illis angeli servituri; illi ideo, ut ex sua fatua fide removerentur, sublati sunt ad primum seu ultimum caelum, ut in societatem quandam angelicam inducerentur; sed cum in introitu erant, ad influxum lucis caeli incipiebant caligare oculis, dein perturbari intellectu, demum trahere animam sicut moribundi; et cum sentirent calorem caeli, qui est amor caelestis, incipiebant intus cruciari: quapropter inde dejecti sunt; ac dein instructi, quod cognitiones non faciant angelum, sed ipsa vita, quam adepti per cognitiones; quoniam cognitiones in se spectatae sunt extra caelum, sed vita per cognitiones intra caelum. </p>
