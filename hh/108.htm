<h3 align="center" class="ired">《天堂与地狱》 第108节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>108、世间万物皆源于神性，且披上尘世中使它们在这里存在并发挥某种功用的事物，因此相对应。这一点可以从动物界和植物界的各种事例中明显地看出来，人若深入思考，就会发现来自天堂的事物在其中。我们可以从无数事例中提及少数几个来加以说明。<br><br>
先谈谈动物中的某些现象。许多人已经意识到某种知识好似本能被植入在每个动物中。蜜蜂知道如何从花朵中采集蜂蜜，用蜡筑巢以储存蜂蜜，从而为自己和家人提供食物，甚至为即将到来的冬天贮备食物。为了繁育新一代，蜂群的蜂王产卵，其余的则精心照料并将它们封盖；它们生活在所有蜜蜂都本能知道的一种管理形式下。它们保护工蜂，赶走雄蜂，还剥去雄蜂的翅膀；除此之外，出于它们功用的缘故，还有其它奇妙的东西从天堂而来被赋予给它们：蜂蜡到处为人类提供蜡烛，蜂蜜则让食物甜蜜。<br><br>
[2]再看看毛毛虫、这个在动物界最低等的生物身上又有怎样的奇迹！它们知道如何从适合自己的叶子汁中获取食物，时候到了，就用覆盖物把自己包裹起来，如同进入子宫，孵化出自己族群的后代。有的先变成若虫和蛹，并吐丝缠绕自己，这场劳苦结束后，它们便穿着新的身体出来，长着翅膀，在空中飞翔，就像在它们的天堂里一样，庆祝婚配，产卵，为自己繁衍后代。<br><br>
[3]除了这些具体的例子外，总的来讲，凡在空中飞的生物都知道适合滋养它们的食物——不仅知道这食物是什么，还知道在哪里找到它；它们知道怎样为自己筑巢——不同的种类筑巢的方式都不相同；知道如何在巢中下蛋，抱窝孵化雏鸟并喂养它们，等雏鸟能独立时，又把它们赶出家门；它们从小就知道必须逃避的天敌和可以结交的朋友，更不用说鸟蛋本身的奇迹了：里面所有的东西都按照它们的秩序准备好了，以便雏鸟的形成和营养。此外还有无数的奇迹。<br><br>
[4]但凡出于理性智慧的思考，谁还会说这些本能是出于灵界以外的任何其它的源头？尘世服务于灵界，用身体包裹来自灵界之物，或将原因中的灵性之物呈现在结果中。地上的走兽和空中的飞鸟生来就俱备这一切的知识，而远比它们高级的人却没有，原因在于，动物处在它们生命的秩序中，不能破坏它们里面来自灵界的东西，因为它们没有理性的官能。而另一方面，人的思想来自灵界，但能用理性官能所偏爱的、违背秩序的生活扭曲他里面来自灵界的东西。所以他必须生在纯粹的无知中，然后通过神性的手段被带回到天堂的秩序中。</p>
<p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>108. 世上的一切事物皆凭神性存在, 并披上诸如自然界中能使它们在那里存在并发挥某种功用, 因而相对应的那类事物; 这一点从可见于动物界和植物界的各种现象明显看出来. 人若深入思考, 就会发现动物界和植物界中的事物来自天堂. 我们可从无数事例中提及少数现象加以说明; 先说说动物界中的某些现象. 许多人已经意识到有什么样的知识可以说被植入每个动物. 蜜蜂知道如何从花朵采集蜂蜜, 用蜂蜡筑巢, 以储存蜂蜜, 从而为自己和自己的蜂巢, 甚至为将要到来的冬天预备食物. 为了生育新一代, 它们的蜂王产卵, 其余的则精心照料并覆佑它们. 整个蜂巢生活在一种所有蜜蜂凭本能都知道的政府形式之下. 它们保存工蜂, 逐出雄蜂, 剥去它们的翅膀; 此外还有其它为了它们的功用而从天堂被植入它们的奇迹. 蜂蜡为人类提供蜡烛, 蜂蜜则提供甜蜜的食物.<br><br>还有可见于毛虫, 就是动物界最不起眼的生物中的奇迹! 它们知道如何从树叶的汁液获取适合自己的食物, 后来到了指定时间就“作茧自缚”, 如同进入子宫, 从而孵化自己种类的后代. 有的先变成若虫和蛹, 并吐丝缠绕自己; 这种产痛结束后, 它们便披着新的身体出来, 并带有翅膀, 以便它们能在空中如在自己的天堂那样展翅飞翔, 并庆祝婚姻, 产卵, 为自己繁衍后代.<br><br>除了这些具体例子外, 总的来说, 凡在空中飞的一切生物都知道滋养它们的合适食物, 不仅知道这食物是什么, 还知道在哪里找到它. 它们知道如何为自己筑巢, 并且各个种类筑巢的方式都与众不同; 知道如何在巢中下蛋, 坐在上面孵化它们的幼雏, 并喂养它们, 等它们独立后, 就把它们赶出家门. 它们还知道必须逃避的天敌和可以结交的朋友, 并且这种知识从小就有; 更不用说鸡蛋本身中的奇迹了, 因为鸡蛋里面早已依次预备好形成并滋养小鸡的一切事物了; 此外还有其它无数现象.<br><br>凡出于理性智慧思考的人, 谁会说这些本能不是来自灵界, 而是来自任何其它源头? 而自然界通过用一个身体包裹来自灵界之物, 或将原因中的属灵之物呈现在结果中而服务于灵界. 地上的走兽和空中的飞鸟生来就进入这一切知识, 而远比它们优越的人却不然. 原因在于, 动物处于它们生命的秩序, 并且不能毁坏来自灵界而在它们里面的东西, 因为它们没有理性官能. 另一方面, 人的思维来自灵界, 他因过着得到其理性官能支持的违背秩序的生活而败坏了来自灵界而在他里面的东西, 所以他必须生在纯粹的无知中, 然后通过神性手段被带回天堂的秩序. </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>108. 世間萬物從上帝而生, 裹以各樣物質的元素, 得以顯現, 服務其用, 因而對應。這樣的事實可通過對動物界和植物界的觀察得出。任何人只要稍加深思, 都能看出動物界和植物界有的物種定是來自天國。下面我從無數的事例中稍加列舉, 以作說明。<br><br>先說動物, 很多人已注意到動物所具有的本能。蜜蜂知道如何採集花粉, 釀造蜂蜜, 又用蜂蠟築巢, 以儲存蜂蜜, 為個體和大家庭準備過冬的食物。蜂王產卵, 工蜂加以孵育, 以繁衍新的一代。整個蜂群過著一種政府治理式的生活, 蜂群中的所有成員本能地知道這種治理方式。它們保留工蜂, 驅逐雄蜂, 還剝掉它們的翅膀。為了有用, 它們還擁有其它從天國而來的神奇本領。事實上, 蜂蠟為人類提供了照明的蠟燭, 蜂蜜則為人類提供了養生的食物。<br><br>再說動物界最低等的毛蟲。它們知道從樹葉的汁液獲取養分, 在合適的時候作繭自縛, 如同進入子宮, 以繁衍後代。有的先化蛹吐絲, 經過辛苦蛻變, 直到破繭而出, 擁有新的身體和美麗的翅膀, 然後在空中翩翩起舞, 仿佛到達了它的天國, 繼而慶祝自己的"婚禮,"下蛋產卵, 繁衍後代。<br><br>此外, 天空的飛鳥無不知道適合它的食物, 也知道往何處去尋找。它們知道如何築巢, 隨其種類, 巢的樣式各不相同;也知道在巢內下蛋, 孵育餵養, 直到雛鳥長成, 能啟獨立, 就打發離開。它們自幼便知當逃避的天敵和可結交的夥伴。更不必說鳥蛋本身的奇妙, 蛋殼之內居然儲存著雛鳥成形孕育的所有資訊, 當中的奧妙不可勝數。<br><br>憑理性思考之人豈會說此等奧妙不是源自心靈世界？物質世界如同肉身包裹著心靈世界, 心靈之物在物質上得到彰顯。心靈是因, 物質是果。地上的動物和天空的飛鳥生來具備此等知識, 而更為高等的人<br><br>類卻不然;原因在於動物不具備理性, 它們順著生活的定規而行, 無法毀壞從心靈世界而來的植於其中的規則。而另一方面, 靠著心靈世界而思維的人類卻不同, 因為過著違背聖規的生活, 於是敗壞了他們裡面從心靈世界而來的規則。因此, 人類不可避免地被生於無知之中, 好叫他們按照神性的途徑, 重新被引入天國的樣式之中。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #108 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>108. The fact that everything in this world arises from the Divine and is clothed with the kinds of elements in nature that enable it to be present there, serve some use, and therefore correspond, follows clearly from little things we can observe in both the animal and the vegetable kingdoms. In each there are things that anyone, with some deeper thought, can see must come from heaven. By way of illustration I may mention only a few out of the countless many. <br><br>First, some from the animal kingdom. In this field, many people realize what kind of knowledge is virtually instinctive in any creature you choose. Bees know how to collect honey from flowers, build cells from wax in which they store their honey, and so provide food for themselves and their families for the coming winter. Their queen lays eggs, while the others cover them over and lead her around so that a new generation may be born. They live under a kind of government that all their members know instinctively, protecting their useful members and expelling the useless ones and clipping off their wings. There are even more marvels that are given them from heaven for their use. In fact, their wax serves the human race throughout the world for candles, and their honey for flavoring foods.<p> </p><p>[2] Then what about caterpillars, the lowest creatures in the animal kingdom! They know how to nourish themselves with the sap of their leaves and in due time how to make a covering around themselves and virtually put themselves in a womb and so to hatch offspring of their own species. Some first turn into nymphs and chrysalides and make threads, and after exhausting labor grace themselves with new bodies and adorn themselves with wings. Then they fly in the air as though it were their heaven, celebrate their "weddings," lay their eggs, and so provide themselves with a posterity.<p> </p><p>[3] Over and above these particular examples, all the fowl of the air know the foods that are good for them - not only what they are, but where they are. They know how to construct nests for themselves, each species differently from all others, how to lay their eggs there, incubate them, hatch and feed their chicks, and expel them from the nest when they can be on their own. They also know the particular enemies they must avoid and the allies they can associate with, all from earliest infancy. I will say nothing about the wonders in the eggs themselves, where everything necessary for the formation and nourishment of the embryonic chicks lies properly available, or countless other wonders.<p> </p><p>[4] Will anyone who thinks with any rational wisdom say that such things arise from any source but a spiritual world, a world that the natural world serves by clothing what comes from it with a body, or presenting in effect that which is spiritual in origin? <br><br>The reason why earthbound animals and the fowl of the air are born into all this knowledge while we, who are actually superior, are not, is that animals are in the proper pattern of their life and cannot destroy what is within them from the spiritual world because they are not rational. It is different for us, who think from the spiritual world. Because we have corrupted ourselves by living contrary to the design that reason itself has recommended to us, we cannot escape being born into total ignorance, so that we can be led from there, by divine means, back into the pattern of heaven. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #108 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p>108. That all things in the world come into existence from the Divine, and are clothed with such things in nature as enable them to exist there and perform a use, and thus to correspond, is clearly evident from individual things seen in both the animal and vegetable kingdoms. In both there are things that anyone, if he thinks interiorly, can see to be from heaven. For illustration a few things out of a countless number may be mentioned, first some things in the Animal Kingdom. Many people are aware what knowledge there is implanted as it were in every animal. Bees know how to gather honey from flowers, to build cells out of wax in which they store their honey and thus provide food for themselves and their own [hive] even for the coming winter. That a new generation may be born, their queen lays eggs, and the rest take care of them and cover them. The whole hive live under a certain form of government which all in the hive know by instinct. They preserve the working bees and cast out the drones, depriving them of their wings, besides other wonderful things which they have from heaven for the sake of use. For, throughout the world, their wax serves the human race for candles, and their honey for sweetening food. <p> </p><p>[2] And what happens in the case of caterpillars (vermiculus), the meanest creatures in the animal kingdom? They know how to get food from the juice of leaves suited to them, and afterwards at the appointed time to invest themselves with a covering and place themselves, as it were, in a womb and so hatch out an offspring of their own kind. Some are first changed into nymphs and chrysalides which spin threads; and this travail being over, they come forth clad with a different body and, furnished with wings, fly in the air as in their heaven. They celebrate marriages, lay eggs and provide for themselves a posterity. <p> </p><p>[3] Besides these specific instances, all creatures that fly in the sky know in general the food suitable for their nourishment, not only what it is but even where to find it. They know how to build nests for themselves, each species different from any other, to lay eggs in the nest, to sit upon them, hatch their young and feed them, and to turn them out of the home when they are able to be independent. They also know their enemies that they have to avoid and their friends with whom they may associate, and this from earliest infancy; not to mention the wonders in the eggs themselves in which all things lie ready in their order for the formation and nourishment of the embryo chick, besides innumerable other things. <p> </p><p>[4] Who, thinking from any rational wisdom, will ever say that these things are from any other source than the spiritual world to which the natural world is of service in wrapping around it a body that is derived from it or for presenting as an effect that which is spiritual in its cause? The beasts of the earth and the fowls of the air are born into all this knowledge while man, who is superior to them, is not. The reason is that animals are in the order of their life and have not been able to destroy what is in them from the spiritual world, because they have no rational [faculty]. Man, on the other hand, who thinks from the spiritual world, having perverted what is in him from that world by a life contrary to order, which his rational faculty has favoured, must needs be born into mere ignorance and afterwards be led back by Divine means into the order of heaven. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #108 (Ager, 1900)</h4><p>108. That all things in the world spring from the Divine, and are clothed with such things in nature as enable them to exist there and perform use, and thus to correspond, is clearly evident from the various things seen in both the animal and vegetable kingdoms.

They know how to get food from the juice of the leaves suited to them, and afterward at the appointed time to invest themselves with a covering and enter as it were into a womb, and thus hatch offspring of their own kind. Some are first turned into nymphs and chrysalides, spinning threads about themselves; and this travail being over they come forth clad with a different body, furnished with wings with which they fly in the air as in their heaven, and celebrate marriages and lay eggs and provide posterity for themselves.<br><br>[3] Besides these special instances all creatures in general that fly in the air know the proper food for their nourishment, not only what it is but where to find it; they know how to build nests for themselves, one kind in one way and another kind in another way; how to lay their eggs in the nests, how to sit upon them, how to hatch their young and feed them, and to turn them out of their home when they are able to shift for themselves. They know, too, their enemies that they must avoid and their friends with whom they may associate, and this from early infancy; not to mention the wonders in the eggs themselves, in which all things lie ready in their order for the formation and nourishment of the chicks; besides numberless other things.<br><br>[4] Who that thinks from any wisdom of reason will ever say that these instincts are from any other source than the spiritual world, which the natural serves in clothing what is from it with a body, or in presenting in effect what is spiritual in the cause? The beasts of the earth and the birds of the air are born into all this knowledge, while man, who is far superior to them, is not; for the reason that animals are in the order of their life, and have not been able to destroy what is in them from the spiritual world, because they have no rational faculty. Man, on the other hand, whose thought is from the spiritual world, having perverted what is in him from that world by a life contrary to order, which his rational faculty has favored, must needs be born into mere ignorance and afterwards be led back by Divine means into the order of heaven. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #108 (original Latin)</h4><p>108. Quod omnia quae in mundo sunt ex Divino existant, ac induantur talibus in natura, per quae ibi esse possunt, et facere usum, et sic correspondere, constat manifeste ex singulis quae in regno tam animali quam vegetabili apparent in utroque sunt talia, quae quisque videre potest, si ex interiori cogitat, quod e caelo sint. Ad illustrationem ex innumerabilibus pauca licet memorare; hic primum aliqua in Regno Animali. Ibi qualis scientia quasi insita sit cuilibet animali, pluribus notum est. Sciunt apes legere mella ex floribus; condere cellulas ex cera, in quibus mella sua recondant, et sic sibi et suis prospicere cibo etiam pro futura hieme femella eorum ponit ova, ceteri ministrant, et circuminducunt illa, ut inde nova propago nascatur vivunt in quadam regiminis forma, quam ex insito norunt omnes ibi, utiles conservant, ac inutiles ejiciunt ac deprivant alis; praeter alia mirabilia, quae illis ex caelo propter usum cera enim inservit humano generi pro lucernis in toto orbe, et mel pro condiendis cibis. Quid non fit cum vermiculis, qui in regno animali vilissima sunt? Sciunt illi se nutrire succo ex suis foliis, et postea exacto tempore se circum inducere tegmine, et quasi ponere in utero, et sic excludere prolem sui generis. Quidam vertuntur primum in nymphas et chrysallides, ac fila producunt, et post exantlatum laborem exornantur alio corpore, et insigniuntur alis, et volant in aere ut in suo caelo, ac conjugia celebrant, ponunt ova, et sibi prospiciunt posteritatem. Praeter hos in specie, sciunt in genere omnia volatilia caeli suos cibos, quibus nutriantur, non solum quinam sunt, sed etiam ubinam; sciunt condere sibi nidos, unum genus aliter quam alterum, ponere ibi ova, incubare illis, excludere suos pullos, et alere, ac ejicere domo cum sui juris esse possunt; sciunt etiam suos hostes quos fugiant, et suos amicos quibus consocientur, et haec a prima infantia: ut taceam mirabilia in ipsis ovis, ubi omnia pro formatione et nutritione inchoantis pulli parata jacent in suo ordine: praeter innumerabilia alia. Quis usquam dicturus est, qui ex aliqua rationis sapientia cogitat, quod haec aliunde sint quam ex spirituali mundo, cui inservit naturalis pro amiciendo id, quod inde est, corpore, seu sistendo in effectu id quod spirituale est in causa? Quod animalia telluris, et volatilia caeli, nascantur in omnem illam scientiam, et non homo, qui tamen illis praestantior est, causa est, quia animalia in ordine vitae suae sunt, nec potuerunt id quod in illis ex spirituali mundo est, destruere, quoniam illis non rationale aliter homo, qui ex spirituali mundo cogitat is quia id apud se pervertit per vitam contra ordinem, cui favet rationale, ideo is non potest aliter quam in meram ignorantiam nasci, et dein per media Divina in ordinem caeli reduci. </p>
