<h4 align="center"></h4><p>442、人的这两种状态，也就是人处在他的内层、或者也可说在灵里时的状态，是非同寻常的。它们被展示给我，只是使我可以了解它们是怎么回事，因为它们在教会内被人熟知。但至于我蒙允许与灵人交谈，作为他们中的一员与他们在一起，甚至在身体完全清醒的时候，这事迄今已持续多年。</p>

<p>442. 这两种状态, 也就是人处于其内层, 或也可说在灵里时的状态, 是非同寻常的. 它们被指示给我, 只是指教我它们是什么样, 因为它们在教会是众所周知的. 至于与灵人交谈, 作为他们当中的一员与他们同在, 那是我蒙恩在肉身完全清醒时所行的事, 这种事如今也已持续数年. </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>442. 這兩種狀態是人在靈裡的狀態, 不同於尋常。它們顯明於我, 只是叫我有所瞭解, 因為教會知道它們的存在。至於與各靈的交談, 以及作為他們當中一員的相處, 迄今已持續多年, 甚至是在我肉身完全清醒的狀態下進行的。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #442 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>442. These two states, though, which are states we have when we are awake to our deeper nature or (which is the same thing) our spirit, are out of the ordinary. They were shown me simply to teach me what they were like because they are known in the church. But talking with spirits, being with them as one of them - this is something I have been granted when I was fully awake physically, and it has been going on now for years. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #442 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p>442. But these two states of man, which are his states when he is in his interiors, or what is the same, when he is in the spirit, are extraordinary; but as they are states known about in the Church, they were exhibited to me only that I might know what they are. But it has been granted to me now for many years to speak with spirits and to be with them as one of them, even in full wakefulness of the body. </p><p align="center">------------</p>

<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #442 (original Latin)</h4><p>442. Sed hi bini status hominis, qui sunt status ejus cum est in interioribus suis, seu quod idem, cum in spiritu, sunt extraordinarii ostensi mihi solum ob finem, ut scirem quales sunt, quia intra ecclesiam noti sunt; at loqui cum spiritibus, et esse cum illis sicut unus eorum, datum est mihi etiam in omni vigilia corporis, et id nunc per multos annos. </p>
