<h3 align="center" class="ired">《天堂与地狱》 第552节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>552、人死后进入这种状态时，他就不再是处在第一个状态时（参看第<a href="../hh/491.htm">491</a>-<a href="../hh/498.htm">498</a>节）的灵魂状态，而是一个真正的灵人。因为真正的灵人有脸和身体，与属于他他心智（意图）的内在相对应，也就是说，他有一个外形，它是其内在的印记或形像。当前面所描述的第一和第二个状态结束后，灵人就变成这样。因此，当他们被看到时，不仅从他的脸上，还从他的身体上，甚至从他的言谈举止中，立刻知道他的品性。而且，因为此时他活在自己的秉性中，<a href="#a538">｛注1｝</a>故只能在他的同类所在的地方。<br><br>
[2]在灵界，情感及其思想完全被分享，因此，灵人自发地向同类的灵人移动，这是出于他的情感和喜悦。事实上，他将自己转向那个方向，因为这样他就能吸入自己的生命，或者能自由地呼吸，<a href="#a539">｛注2｝</a>而转向其它的方向则不能。应当知道，在灵界，与他人分享是根据脸的转动来实现的，在每个人面前的总是处在同类爱欲中的人，无论他怎样转动身体，都是如此（参看第<a href="../hh/151.htm">151</a>节）。<br><br>
[3]因此，所有的地狱灵人都转离主，朝向尘世太阳和月亮所在之处的幽暗和漆黑；而天堂的天使都转向显为天堂太阳和月亮的主（参见<a href="../hh/123.htm">123</a>，<a href="../hh/143.htm">143</a>，<a href="../hh/144.htm">144</a>，<a href="../hh/151.htm">151</a>节）。从这些事可以确定，凡在地狱里的人都处在邪恶及其伪谬中，他们也都转向自己的爱欲。<br><br>
<a name="a538">｛注1｝</a>：【英300】“秉性”的原文是se est （“是 . . .他的本质自我”）。也可以翻译为“在他自己中”。<br><br>
<a name="a545">｛注2｝</a>：【英301】“呼吸”的原文是animam，意思是“呼吸”和“灵魂”。</p>
<p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>552. 当人死后进入这种状态时, 他就不再像处于第一个状态时(<a href="../ac/491.htm">天国的奥秘 491-498</a>节)那样是一个人-灵, 而是一个真正的灵; 因为他是一个真正的灵, 拥有与属其心智的内在相对应的面孔和身体, 也就是说, 他所拥有的外在形式是其内在的一个印记或形像. 一旦前面所描述的第一和第二个状态结束, 灵便是这样. 这意味着当以属灵的眼睛看他时, 他的性质不仅从他的面孔, 还从他的身体, 尤其从他的言行举止立刻被认出. 此外, 那时他因在自己里面, 或说是本质的自己, 故只能在他的同类所在的地方.<br><br>灵界有情感及其思维的完全共享, 因此灵人自发转向自己的同类, 因为他们是出于其情感及其思维而如此行的. 事实上, 他转向那个方向, 因为这样他就能吸入自己的生命, 或自由呼吸, 而转向其它方向则不能. 必须知道的是, 在灵界, 与他人的这种共享取决于人所面对的方向; 在他面前的, 总是处于同类爱的人; 无论他怎样转动身体, 都是如此(参看<a href="151.htm">151</a>节).<br><br>正因如此, 所有地狱灵都背离主, 面向那里取代这个世界的太阳和月亮的幽暗, 漆黑物体, 而天堂天使都面向显为天堂太阳和月亮的主(参看123, <a href="143.htm">143</a>, <a href="144.htm">144</a>, <a href="151.htm">151</a>节). 由此清楚可知, 凡在地狱里的人都陷入邪恶和由此而来的虚假; 他们也都转向自己的爱. </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>552. 至此, 他不再是第一個狀態下的靈, 而是成了真正的靈, 因為真正的靈有著與內在秉性相應的面孔和身體, 就是說, 他的外在形體乃是其內在秉性的相。當前面所描述的第一, 第二個狀態結束以後, 靈將變得如此。通過他們的面孔, 身體, 特別是言行舉止, 能立時明瞭他們的秉性。再者, 他們既成了真實的自我, 就只能與同類的靈呆在一起。<br><br>在心靈世界, 情感和思想是相通的。靈自然而然地趨向同類之靈, 為他們所吸引, 也從中感受到快樂。事實上, 他面對著那個方向, 因為只有對著那個方向, 他才能自由地呼吸, 面對其它方向卻不然。我們當知, 在心靈世界, 交流取決於人所面對的方向。在他面前的, 通常都是有著同類情感之靈。不論他怎樣轉動身體, 都是如此。<br><br>正因如此, 地獄之靈全都背對主, 面對漆黑幽暗之地, 就是世間日月所在之處。反之, 天國的天人全都面對那顯為天國日月的主。<br><br>由此可以推斷, 地獄之靈全都沉迷於惡謬, 也都朝向各自的欲望。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #552 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>552. When we are like this after death, then we are no longer "spirit-persons" the way we were in the first state (described above, <a href="491.htm">491-498</a>); we are truly spirits, since people who are truly spirits have faces and bodies responsive to the inner natures of their minds. So they are in an outward form that is the imprint or image of their inner natures. Spirits are like this once the first and second states described above have been completed. This means that when they are seen by [spiritual] eyes, one can tell instantly what their nature is not only from their faces but also from their bodies, and especially from their speech and behavior. Further, because they are now their essential selves, they can only be where kindred souls are.<p> </p><p>[2] There is a complete sharing of affections and consequent thoughts in the spiritual world; so spirits move spontaneously toward kindred spirits because they are motivated by what attracts and delights them. In fact, they actually turn in that direction because that is how they breathe in their life, or draw their breath freely, and not when they turn elsewhere. We need to realize that in the spiritual world, communication depends on which way we face, and that the people in front of us are always the ones who are in a love like our own. This applies no matter which way we turn our bodies (see above, <a href="151.htm">151</a>).<p> </p><p>[3] This is why hellish spirits all turn away from the Lord toward the gloomy and dark objects there that are in the location of earth's sun and moon, while heaven's angels all turn toward the Lord as the sun and the moon of heaven (see above, <a href="123.htm">123</a>, <a href="143.htm">143-144</a>, <a href="151.htm">151</a>).<br><br>This leads us to the conclusion that all the people in the hells are absorbed in evils and consequent falsities, and also that they turn toward their loves. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #552 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p>552. When a man after death is such, he is no longer a man-spirit, as he was in his first state (of which above, <a href="491.htm">491-498</a>), but is truly a spirit; for he is truly a spirit who has a face and body corresponding to his internals which pertain to his mind (animus), that is, has an external form that is a type or effigy of his internals. A spirit is such after he has passed through the first and second states spoken of above; consequently, when he is looked upon, his character is at once known, not only from his face but also from his body, and even more so from his speech and movements; and as he is then in himself he can be nowhere else than where his like are. <p> </p><p>[2] For in the spiritual world, there is a complete sharing of affections and the thoughts therefrom, and in consequence a spirit is conveyed to his like as if of himself, since it is done from his own affection and its delight. In fact, he turns himself in that direction; for thus he inhales his own life or draws his breath freely, which he cannot do when he turns another way. It ought to be known that this sharing with others in the spiritual world is effected in accordance with the turning of the face, and that each one has constantly before his face those who are in a love like his own, and this in every turning of the body (see above, <a href="151.htm">151</a>). <p> </p><p>[3] In consequence of this, all infernal spirits turn themselves backwards from the Lord towards the dense blackness and the darkness that are there in place of the sun and moon of this world, while all the angels of heaven turn themselves to the Lord as the Sun of heaven and as the Moon of heaven (see above, <a href="123.htm">123</a>, <a href="143.htm">143-144</a>, <a href="151.htm">151</a>). From these things now it can be established that all who are in the hells are in evils and in falsities therefrom; also that they are turned to their own loves. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #552 (Ager, 1900)</h4><p>552. When man after death comes into this state he is no longer a man-spirit, as he was in his first state (of which above, <a href="491.htm">491-498</a>), but is truly a spirit; for he is truly a spirit who has a face and body that correspond to his internals which pertain to his mind, that is, has an external form that is a type or effigy of his internals.

In fact, he turns himself in that direction; for thus he inhales his own life or draws his breath freely, which he cannot do when he turns another way. It must be understood that this sharing with others in the spiritual world is effected in accordance with the turning of the face, and that each one has constantly before his face those who are in a love like his own, and this in every turning of the body (see above, <a href="151.htm">151</a>)<br><br>[3] In consequence of this all infernal spirits turn themselves away from the Lord toward the densely dark body and the dark body that are there in place of the sun and moon of this world, while all the angels of heaven turn themselves to the Lord as the sun of heaven and as the moon of heaven (see above, <a href="123.htm">123</a>, <a href="143.htm">143, 144</a>, <a href="151.htm">151</a>). From all this it is clear that all who are in the hells are in evils and in falsities therefrom; also that they are turned to their own loves. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #552 (original Latin)</h4><p>552. Cum talis est homo post mortem, tunc non amplius est homo spiritus, qualis est in primo suo statu (de quo supra, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_552/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_491" target=_top>491-498</a>), sed est vere spiritus; nam vere spiritus est in facie et corpore correspondente suis internis, quae sunt animi ejus, ita in forma externa quae est typus seu effigies ejus internorum. Talis est spiritus post exactum primum et secundum statum, de quibus supra: quare tunc, cum spectatur oculis, statim cognoscitur, qualis est, non modo ex facie sed etiam ex corpore, ac praeterea ex loquela et ex gestibus et quia tunc in se est, non potest alibi esse, quam ubi similes.<br><br> <br>[2] Est enim communicatio affectionum et inde cogitationum omnimoda in mundo spirituali; quapropter spiritus fertur ad similes sui, quasi ex se, quia ex sua affectione et ejus jucundo; immo etiam se illuc convertit; nam sic spirat suam vitam, seu trahit libere suam animam, non autem cum convertit se alio. Sciendum est, quod communicatio cum aliis in mundo spirituali fiat secundum conversionem faciei, et quod ante faciem cujusvis sint jugiter illi, qui in simili secum amore sunt, et hoc in omni conversione corporis (videatur supra, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_552/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_151" target=_top>151</a>). Inde est, quod omnes spiritus infernales se convertant retro a Domino ad caliginosum et tenebrosum, quae ibi sunt loco solis et loco lunae mundi, sed quod omnes angeli caeli se convertant ad Dominum ut Solem caeli ac ut Lunam caeli (videatur supra, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_552/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_123" target=_top>123</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_552/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_143" target=_top>143</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_552/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_144" target=_top>144</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_552/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_151" target=_top>151</a>). Ex his nunc constare potest, quod omnes, qui in infernis sunt, in malis et inde falsis sint et quoque quod conversi sint ad suos amores. </p>
