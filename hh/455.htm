<h3 align="center" class="ired">《天堂与地狱》 第455节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>455、理性的人可以理解上面所说的，因为他们能透过原因的联系和它们秩序中的真理来明白它们。但是，不理性的人却不能理解，原因有几个，主要是他不愿意去理解它们，因为它们与他的谬误对立，而他视这些谬误为真理。因为这个原因而不愿意理解的人，就关闭了天堂通往他的理性官能的通道，尽管如此，只要意志不抗拒，这条通道仍然可以打开（见上文第<a href="../hh/424.htm">424</a>节）。大量的经历向我表明，只要人愿意，他就有能力理解真理、变得理性。在世时因弃绝上帝和教会真理，并确认自己反对他们而变得不理性的恶灵，常常被神性大能转向那些处在真理之光中的天使，那时，他们能像天使那样理解一切，并承认它们是真理，也承认自己全都能明白。但他们一回到自己的本相中、转回到自己的意愿之爱中时，就对真理一无所知，而且肯定真理的对立面了。<br><br>
[2]我甚至听到地狱里的某些居民说，他们知道并感知到自己所做的是邪恶的，所思想的是伪谬的，但他们无法抗拒喜爱这些的快乐，也就是意愿这些的快乐，正是他们的意志驱使他们的思想将邪恶视为良善、将谬误视为真理。因此，很显然，那些处在源于邪恶的谬误之中的人，有能力去理解真理并因此变得理性，只是他们不愿意这样做，原因在于他们爱谬误胜过真理，因为这些谬误支持他们所处的邪恶。爱和意愿是一回事，因为人爱他所意愿的，意愿他所爱的。<br><br>
[3]因为人的状态是这样的：如是他愿意，他就能理解真理，所以，我蒙允许去确认灵性真理、也就是天堂和教会的真理，甚至通过推理，这是为了用推理驱那些散封闭了许多人理性的伪谬，使他们的眼睛能在某种程度上被打开。因为凡在真理中的人，都被允许用理性真理来确认灵性真理。谁也不能仅从字面意义来理解圣经，除非他通过启示的理性看到其中的真理。缺乏这些不正是诸多异端出自同样的圣经的根源吗？<a href="#a483">｛注1｝</a><br><br>
<a name="a483">｛注1｝</a>：出自圣经的教会教义的真理必须是起点，这些真理必须先得到承认，然后才允许向知识求问（<a href="../ac/6047.htm">6047</a>）。因此，那些对信仰的真理持肯定态度的人，允许通过知识来理性地确认这些真理，但那些持否认态度的人则不可以（<a href="../ac/2568.htm">2568</a>，<a href="../ac/2588.htm">2588</a>，<a href="../ac/4760.htm">4760</a>，<a href="../ac/6047.htm">6047</a>）。按照神性的秩序，灵性真理理性地进入知识，知识是属世真理，而不是从后者进入前者，因为灵性流注进入属世的事物是可能的，但属世或物质的流注不能流入属灵的事物（<a href="../ac/3219.htm">3219</a>，<a href="../ac/5119.htm">5119</a>，<a href="../ac/5259.htm">5259</a>，<a href="../ac/5427.htm">5427</a>，<a href="../ac/5428.htm">5428</a>，<a href="../ac/5478.htm">5478</a>，<a href="../ac/6322.htm">6322</a>，<a href="../ac/9109.htm">9109</a>，<a href="../ac/9110.htm">9110</a>）。</p>
<p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>455. 目前所说的这一切能被理性人理解, 因为他们能从原因链和在自己秩序中的真理看到这一点. 然而, 缺乏理性的人却不理解. 不理解的原因有几个, 其中最主要的是, 他们不愿去理解, 因为这些事反对他们以之为真理的虚假. 人若由于这个原因而不愿理解, 就会关闭天堂进入其理性能力的道路. 尽管如此, 只要意愿不再抵制(参看<a href="424.htm">424</a>节), 这条路仍能打开. 大量经历向我清楚表明, 只要愿意, 人就能理解真理, 变得理性. 在世时因弃绝神性和教会真理, 确认反对它们而变得不理性的恶灵常常被神性大能转向那些处于真理之光的人; 那时, 他们能像天使那样理解一切事物, 并承认它们是真理, 而且全都能明白. 但这些灵人一回到自己里面, 转回到其意愿之爱中, 就又不理解这些真理, 并肯定反面了.<br><br>我还听见一些住在地狱里的人说, 他们知道并发觉自己所行的是邪恶, 所思的是虚假; 但他们无法抵制自己的爱, 也就是自己意愿的快乐; 正是他们的意愿驱使他们的思维去视邪恶为良善, 视虚假为真理. 我由此看出, 那些陷入源于邪恶的虚假之人有能力去理解并变得理性, 只是不愿这样做. 不愿意的原因在于, 他们爱虚假胜过真理, 因为这些虚假支持他们所陷入的邪恶. 爱和意愿是一回事, 因为人爱凡他所意愿的, 意愿凡他所爱的.<br><br>由于人们的状态是这样: 他们若愿意, 就能理解真理, 所以我蒙允许甚至通过推理来确认属灵真理, 也就是天堂和教会的真理. 这是为了模糊许多人的理性心智的虚假能通过推理被驱散, 他们的眼睛或许能在某种程度上被打开. 事实上, 凡处于真理的人都可以通过推理确认属灵真理. 若不凭启蒙理性看见圣言所包含的真理, 谁能单凭圣言的字义理解圣言? 这难道不是出自同一部圣言的那么多异端的源头吗?<br><br>注: 取自圣言的教会教义的真理必是起点, 必须先承认这些真理, 然后才可以请教知识(<a href="../ac/6047.htm">天国的奥秘 6047</a>节). 因此, 那些对信之真理持肯定态度的人可以通过知识理性确认它们, 但那些持否认态度的人不可以(<a href="../ac/2568.htm">天国的奥秘 2568</a>, <a href="../ac/2588.htm">2588</a>, <a href="../ac/4760.htm">4760</a>, <a href="../ac/6047.htm">6047</a>节). 从属灵真理理性进入知识, 也就是属世真理, 符合神性秩序, 但从后者进入前者违反神性秩序, 因为属灵事物能流入属世事物, 但属世或物质事物不能流入属灵事物(<a href="../ac/3219.htm">天国的奥秘 3219</a>, <a href="../ac/5119.htm">5119</a>, <a href="../ac/5259.htm">5259</a>, <a href="../ac/5427.htm">5427</a>, <a href="../ac/5428.htm">5428</a>, <a href="../ac/5478.htm">5478</a>, <a href="../ac/6322.htm">6322</a>, <a href="../ac/9109.htm">9109</a>, <a href="../ac/9110.htm">9110</a>节). </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>455. 上述之事能被理性之人所理解, 因為他們能從各原因之間的關係以及根據秩序可循之理中明白這些事情。缺乏理性之人卻不能理解, 這其中有很多原因, 最主要的是他們不願意去理解, 因為這些與他們視為真理的錯誤觀念相抵觸。既然不願理解, 從天國通向理性的路就封閉了。但是, 只要他們不抵觸, 這條路還是可以開通的。大量經歷向我表明, 人只要願意, 是可以明理, 成為理性者的。<br><br>一些因在世時否認神性和教會之理而變得無理性的惡靈, 設法確證自己的否定之辭來抵觸神性與真理, 他們時常被迫面對一些處於真理之光中的人。彼時, 他們像天人一樣明理, 承認理之真實。但是, 他們一回到惡欲當中, 又變得一無所知, 口氣也截然相反。我甚至聽見一些惡靈聲稱他們知道自己所行為惡, 所思為偽, 但是他們無法抵擋對欲望的滿足, 也就是對意志的滿足。意志驅使思想去視惡為善, 認偽為真。由此看出, 因惡而陷於偽謬之人是能啟明理並變得理性, 只是他們不想如此。不想明理的原因在於他們熱衷於偽謬勝過真理, 因為前者支持他們所追求的惡。欲望與意志是一回事, 因為人皆欲其所志, 志其所欲。<br><br>就人的本性而言, 只要他願意, 就能啟明理。正因如此, 我被允許以理性思維來證實心靈之理, 也就是天國與教會之理, 以驅散那些蒙蔽許多人理性的錯誤觀念, 在某種程度上打開他們的眼界。人若專注於理, 就可以通過理性來證實心靈之理。若非借助理性的啟發而明白聖言中的真理, 誰能單憑字面的含義而理解聖言呢？如此眾多的異端邪說不是出自一部聖言的相同文字嗎？ </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #455 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>455. Rational individuals can understand what has been said so far because they can see this from the chain of causes and from truths in their pattern. However, people who are not rational do not understand these things. There are several reasons why they do not understand. The primary one is that they do not want to understand because these things contradict the false opinions that they have made their truths. People who do not want to understand for this reason close off the path of heaven into their rational ability. Even so, it can still be opened if only their will does not offer resistance (see above, <a href="424.htm">424</a>). A great deal of experience has shown me that people can understand what is true and be rational if only they are willing. Quite often, evil spirits who have become irrational by denying the Divine and the truths of the church in this world (and convincing themselves in their denial) have by divine compulsion been faced toward people who were in the light of truth. Then they understood everything like angels and admitted that they were true and that they understood everything. However, the moment they turned back toward the love proper to their own intentions, they did not understand anything and said just the opposite.<p> </p><p>[2] I have even heard some hellish people saying that they knew and recognized that what they were doing was evil and what they were thinking was false, but that they could not resist the gratification of their love and therefore of their will. This moved their thoughts to see evil as good and falsity as true. I could see from this that people who are immersed in false notions because of their malice could understand and could therefore be rational, but that they did not want to. The reason they did not want to was that they loved false notions more than true ones because the former supported the evil pursuits they were engaged in. Loving and intending are the same thing because we love what we intend and intend what we love.<p> </p><p>[3] Since we are by nature able to understand what is true if we are willing to, I have been granted the privilege of supporting spiritual truths, truths of the church and heaven, by rational considerations. This is to the end that the false notions that have obscured the rational functioning of many people may be dispelled by rational considerations and their eyes perhaps opened a little. If people are focused on truths, it is granted them to support spiritual truths by rational ones. Who would possibly understand the Word simply from its literal meaning unless they saw some truths in it by enlightened reason? What else is the cause of the many heresies drawn from the same Word? <sup>1</sup><br><br><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br><div><p>1.&nbsp;A starting point should be derived from the truths of church doctrine drawn from the Word, and these should be acknowledged first; then it is all right to take factual knowledge into account: <a href="../ac/6047.htm">6047</a>. So if people have an affirmative attitude toward truths of faith, it is all right for them to support them rationally with factual knowledge; but this is not appropriate for people who have a negative attitude: <a href="../ac/2568.htm">2568</a>, <a href="../ac/2588.htm">2588</a>, <a href="../ac/4760.htm">4760</a>, <a href="../ac/6047.htm">6047</a>. It is in accord with the divine design to work rationally from spiritual truths into factual knowledge, natural truths, but not from the latter into the former, because there is an inflow of spiritual things into natural ones but not from natural or physical things into spiritual ones: <a href="../ac/3219.htm">3219</a>, <a href="../ac/5119.htm">5119</a>, <a href="../ac/5259.htm">5259</a>, <a href="../ac/5427.htm">5427-5428</a>, <a href="../ac/5478.htm">5478</a>, <a href="../ac/6322.htm">6322</a>, <a href="../ac/9110.htm">9110-9111</a>. </p></div><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #455 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p>455. Those things which have now been said can be understood by the rational man, for he can see it from the connection of causes and from truths in their order. But it is not understood by a man who is not rational, and for several reasons, the chief of which is that he has no desire to understand them because they are opposed to his falsities which make his truths; and he, who is unwilling to understand for this reason, has closed to his rational, the way to heaven, although that way can still be opened if only the will does not resist (see above, <a href="424.htm">424</a>). That man is able to understand truths and be rational whenever he so wishes has been shown to me by much experience. Evil spirits who have become irrational in the world by rejecting the Divine and the truths of the Church, and confirming themselves against them, have quite often been turned by Divine power towards those who were in the light of truth, and they have then comprehended all things as the angels do, and have acknowledged them to be true, and also that they comprehended them all. But the moment these spirits relapsed into themselves, and turned back to the love of their will, they understood nothing and affirmed the opposite. <p> </p><p>[2] I have even heard certain dwellers in hell say that they knew and perceived that which they did to be evil and that which they thought to be false, but that they were unable to resist the delight of their love, that is, their will, and that it is their will that drives their thought to see evil as good and falsity as truth. Hence, it was clear that those who are in falsity from evil can understand and therefore be rational, but have no wish to do so; and they have no wish for the reason that they have loved falsities more than truths, because these agreed with the evils in which they were. To love and to will is the same thing, for what a man wills he loves, and what he loves he wills. <p> </p><p>[3] Because the state of men is such that they are able to understand truths if they wish to, I have been permitted to confirm spiritual truths, which are truths of heaven and the Church, even by reasonings, and this in order that the falsities by which the rational in many has been closed up may be dispersed by reasonings, and thus the eye may perhaps in some degree be opened; for to confirm spiritual truths by rational truths is permitted to all who are in truths. Who could ever understand the Word from the sense of its letter, unless he saw the truths there from an enlightened rational? Is not this the source of so many heresies from the same Word? <sup>1</sup><br><br><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br><div><p>1.&nbsp;The truths of doctrine of the Church derived from the Word must be the starting-point, and these must first be acknowledged, and afterwards it is permissible to consult knowledges (<a href="../ac/6047.htm">Arcana Coelestia 6047</a>). <br><br>Thus it is permissible for those who are in an affirmative state towards the truths of faith to confirm them rationally by knowledges, but it is not permissible for those who are in a negative state (<a href="../ac/2568.htm">Arcana Coelestia 2568</a>, <a href="../ac/2588.htm">2588</a>, <a href="../ac/4760.htm">4760</a>, <a href="../ac/6047.htm">6047</a>). <br><br>It is in accordance with Divine order to enter rationally from spiritual truths into knowledges, which are natural truths, but not to enter from the latter into the former, because spiritual influx into natural things is possible, but not natural or physical influx into spiritual things (<a href="../ac/3219.htm">Arcana Coelestia 3219</a>, <a href="../ac/5119.htm">5119</a>, <a href="../ac/5259.htm">5259</a>, <a href="../ac/5427.htm">5427-5428</a>, <a href="../ac/5478.htm">5478</a>, <a href="../ac/6322.htm">6322</a>, <a href="../ac/9109.htm">9109-9110</a>). </p></div><p align="center">------------</p>

That which has now been said can be understood by the rational man, for he can see it from the connection of causes and from truths in their order; but it is not understood by a man who is not rational, and for several reasons, the chief of which is that he has no desire to understand it because it is opposed to the falsities that he has made his truths; and he that is unwilling to understand for this reason has closed to his rational faculty the way to heaven, although that way can still be opened whenever the will's resistance ceases (see above, <a href="424.htm">424</a>). That man is able to understand truths and be rational whenever he so wishes has been made clear to me by much experience.

Haec quae nunc dicta sunt, rationalis homo intelligere potest, nam videre potest ex causarum nexu, et ex veris in suo ordine sed homo qui non rationalis est, illa non intelligit. Quod non intelligat, sunt plures causae: praecipua est quod non velit, quia sunt contra ejus falsa, quae fecit sua vera; et qui ideo non vult intelligere, ille occlusit viam caeli ad suum rationale, quod tamen usque aperiri potest, modo voluntas non resistat (videatur supra, n, 424). Quod homo possit intelligere vera, et rationalis esse, modo velit, hoc mihi per multam experientiam ostensum est. Saepius mali spiritus, qui irrationales facti sunt per id quod in mundo negaverint Divinum et vera ecclesiae, et se confirmaverint contra illa, vi Divina conversi sunt ad illos qui in luce veri erant et tunc comprehenderunt omnia sicut angeli, et fassi sunt quod vera sint, et quoque quod omnia comprehendant. Sed utprimum relapsi sunt in se, et conversi ad amorem qui voluntatis eorum, nihil comprehenderunt, et contraria locuti sunt.<br><br> <br>[2] Audivi etiam quosdam infernales dicentes, quod sciant et percipiant quod malum sit quod faciunt, et quod falsum sit quod cogitant, sed quod non resistere possint sui amoris jucundo, ita voluntati, et quod haec ferat cogitata sua, ut malum videant sicut bonum, ac falsum sicut verum. Inde patuit, quod illi qui in falsis sunt ex malo potuerint intelligere, proinde rationales esse, sed quod non voluerint; et quod non voluerint, esset causa, quia amaverunt falsa prae veris, quoniam concordabant cum malis in quibus erant. Amare et velle idem est; nam quod homo vult, hoc amat, et quod amat hoc vult.<br><br> <br>[3] Quoniam talis status est hominum, ut possint intelligere vera modo velint, concessum est mihi spiritualia vera, quae sunt ecclesiae et caeli, etiam per rationalia confirmare ita ob causam, ut falsa, quae apud plures occluserunt rationale, per rationalia discutiantur, et sic forte aliquantum aperiatur oculus nam confirmare vera spiritualia per rationalia omnibus qui in veris sunt concessum est.
