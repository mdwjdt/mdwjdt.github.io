<h3 align="center" class="ired">《天堂与地狱》 第477节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>477、人死后，等候他的是他的主导爱，它永不改变。每个人都有许多种爱，但都与他的主导爱有关，与它合而为一或共同构成它。所有与主导爱和谐一致的意志都被称为“爱”，因为它们被爱着。这些爱既有内层的，也有外层的；有的是直接相连的，有的是间接相连的；有的近，有的远；它们以各种各样的方式从属于主导爱。它们合在一起就构成了一个王国，可以说，它们以这种秩序在人里面被排列着，尽管人完全没有意识到这种排列。然而，在来世，这种排列的东西向他显明，因为在那里，人的思想和情感的延伸就取决于其爱的排列。当主导爱是由天堂之爱构成时，他的思想和情感便延伸到天堂社群；相反，当主导爱由地狱之爱构成时，他的思想和情感便延伸到地狱社群。灵人和天使的所有思想和情感都延伸到社群中，对此，可参看前面有关“天使的智慧”和“天堂的形式决定着那里的联合和交流”等内容（上文第<a href="../hh/265.htm">265</a>-<a href="../hh/275.htm">275</a>节和<a href="../hh/200.htm">200</a>-<a href="../hh/212.htm">212</a>节）。</p>
<p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>477. 死后, 等待人的, 正是他的主导爱, 并且这爱永不改变. 每个人都有许多爱, 不过这些爱都可追溯到他的主导爱, 与主导爱构成一体, 或一起构成它. 与主导爱和谐一致的意愿的所有元素都被称为爱, 因为它们被爱. 这些爱有深有浅; 有直接相联的, 也有间接相联的; 有近的, 也有远的; 还有以各种方式进行服务的爱. 它们合在一起构成一种国度, 事实上以这种方式在人里面被排列, 尽管人完全没有意识到这种排列. 然而, 在来世, 这种排列在某种程度上变得可见, 因为在那里, 他的思维和情感的延伸就取决于对其爱的这种排列. 当主导爱由天堂之爱构成时, 其思维和情感便延伸到天堂社群; 相反, 当主导爱由地狱之爱构成时, 便延伸到地狱社群. 灵人和天使的一切思维和情感都延伸到各个社群, 对此, 可参看前面有关“天堂天使的智慧”和“决定天堂的联系和交流的天堂形式”等章节(<a href="../ac/265.htm">天国的奥秘 265-275</a>, <a href="../ac/200.htm">200-212</a>节). </p><p align="center">------------</p><h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>477. 死後, 每個人都將延續其主導欲, 且永不改變。人之愛欲眾多, 但皆與主導欲相關, 與主導欲合為一或者與其整合。凡與主導欲相合的意志都稱為"愛,"因為為其所熱愛。這些"愛"有內在有外在, 有直接相連者, 有間接相連者。它們以不同方式發揮作用, 一起構成一個王國。事實上, 它們正是以這種方式被安排在人的裡面, 只是人未曾意識到這一點。等進入靈界, 這樣安排在某種程度上可以顯現出來, 因為人的思想和情感在靈界的外延與這些"愛"的安排相一致。人的主導欲若由天國之仁所構成, 其思想和情感的延伸就進入天國般的社群。反之, 人的主導欲若由地獄之"欲"所構成, 其延伸就進入地獄般的社群。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #477 (NCE, 2000)</h4><p>477. There is a dominant love that remains with each of us after death and never changes to eternity. We all have many loves, but they all go back to our dominant love and form a single whole with it, or compose it in the aggregate. All the elements of our volition that agree with our dominant love are called loves because they are loved. There are deeper and more superficial loves, loves that are directly united and loves that are indirectly united; there are closer and more distant ones; there are loves that serve in various ways. Taken all together they make a kind of kingdom. They are actually arranged in this way within us even though we are utterly unaware of their arrangement. However, the arrangement becomes visible to some extent in the other life because the outreach of our thoughts and affections there depends on it. The outreach is into heavenly communities if our dominant love is made up of loves of heaven, but it is into hellish communities if our dominant love is made up of loves of hell.<br><br>On the outreach into communities of all the thought and affection of spirits and angels, see the previous chapters on the wisdom of heaven's angels and on heaven's form, which determines its gatherings and communications [<a href="265.htm">265-275</a>, <a href="200.htm">200-212</a>]. </p><p align="center">------------</p>
<h4 align="center">Heaven and Hell #477 (Harley, 1958)</h4><p> 477. It is man's ruling love that awaits him after death, and this is in no way changed to eternity. Everyone has many loves; but they are all related to his ruling love, and make one with it or together compose it. All things of the will that are in harmony with the ruling love are called loves, because they are loved. These loves are both interior and exterior, some immediately connected and some mediately; some nearer and some more remote; they are subservient in various ways. Taken together they constitute a kingdom, as it were, such being the order in which they are arranged with man, although man knows nothing whatever about that arrangement. And yet something of it is made manifest to him in the other life, for the extension of his thought and affection there, is in accordance with the arrangement of his loves, his thought and affection extending into heavenly societies when the ruling love is made up of the loves of heaven, but into infernal societies when it is made up of the loves of hell. That all the thought and affection of spirits and of angels have extension into societies may be seen above, in the sections on the wisdom of the angels of heaven, and on the form of heaven which determines consociations and communications there. </p><p align="center">------------</p>

<h4 align="center">De Coelo et de Inferno #477 (original Latin)</h4><p>477. Est amor regnans qui manet hominem post mortem, nec usquam in aeternum mutatur; sunt cuivis plures amores, sed usque omnes se referunt ad amorem ejus regnantem, ac unum faciunt cum illo, seu illum simul componunt. Omnia voluntatis quae concordant cum amore regnante vocantur amores, quia amantur. Hi amores sunt interiores et exteriores: sunt qui immediate conjuncti et qui mediate; sunt propiores et remotiores, sunt inservientes vario modo. Simul sumpti constituunt quasi regnum, ita enim ordinati sunt apud hominem, tametsi homo de ordinatione illorum prorsus nihil scit; sed aliquid manifestatur ei in altera vita, nam secundum ordinationem eorum est ei extensio cogitationis et affectionis ibi, extensio in societates caelestes si regnans amor consistit ex amoribus caeli, at in societates infernales si regnans amor consistit ex amoribus inferni. Quod omnis cogitatio et affectio spirituum et angelorum extensionem habeant in societates, videatur supra in articulo De Sapientia Angelorum Caeli, et in articulo De Forma Caeli secundum quam consociationes et communicationes ibi. </p>
